12399	2607	But feeling sorry for them and turning I back on them -LRB- the radicals -RRB- is two different things , I sure wish Obama would learn that ! 
12417	2617	To think Obama campaigned against Obama makes that all the harder to swallow . 
12419	2621	WOW , , , , , look at the chart below , and then look at the results of the poll above ... When you look at the conservative and moderate number number pretty much tells you what the independents will do ... and Liberals , , , , , the same old mistake ... LOL 10493 this looks like a republican view in disguisePresident Obama must be re-elected because Obama is the opposite of Bush and wants to redistribute wealth from the rich corrupt free market place into the hands of the middle class citizens . 
12435	2628	GOP hate to break Period to you , but as bad of a President as Obama is , President is n't a socialist . 
12438	2629	President Obama should be re-elected because Obama is the opposite of Bush and backs the good corporations unlike Bush who backed the oil companies which led to wars for oil and a recession . 
12440	2632	Obama has no problem taking campaign money from these corporations , millionaires and billionaires that Obama rewards . 
12441	2632	Hopefully , if enough Americans wake up from corporations Obama zombie slumber , Obama will be but a distant memory in 2012 . 
12450	2636	Obama is a right-wing neoliberal . 
12451	2636	Obama was installed into power to serve Wall Street and corporate interests , and Obama has not let them down . 
12452	2636	The middle class has no future in the neoliberal worldview of Barack Obama . 
12462	2639	President Obama is as bad a President as G W Bush . 
12463	2639	Both parties hated President also , President was n't a Constitutionalist , President was a centralist , President is a neoconservative , like Obama . 
12469	2641	americans should vote for President Obama because Obama picks the good corporations as winners and makes the bad corporations into losers by paying more taxes for socialist initiatives , this is seen in the domestic drilling ban for the bad oil corporations and the tax breaks for the good corporations like GE for investing in clean energy ... a republican candidate would allow the oil companies to drill for oil causing wars and pollution and not redistribute wealth from the rich and bad corporations to the middle class , President Obama is a hybrid of socialist and corporatist and that is better than a republican who is a capitalist and corporatist . 
12470	2642	Uh , right , more like the fact that Jeffrey Immelt , CEO of GE , is one of Obama 's top campaign contributors . 
12471	2642	The man whom Obama appointed to the President 's Economic Recovery Advisory Board , and to serve as chairman of the Council on Jobs and Competitiveness , while GE pays no taxes on GE massive profits . 
12472	2642	Obama is doing everything you say `` a republican candidate '' would do . 
12474	2642	It is Obama who has launched illegal wars in Libya , Yemen , and Pakistan , while escalating Afghanistan and lying about ever withdrawing from Iraq . 
12475	2642	It is Obama who has pushed hard to protect tax breaks for the rich , and has been obsessed since the day rich got into office with cutting Social Security and Medicare . 
12477	2642	Obama is a hardcore right-wing neoliberal capitalist whose idol is Ronald Reagan . 
12486	2643	populist of course was n't trying to say that Obama is `` against the interests of all corporations '' . 
12493	2645	Guess all those 192 Obama lovers love Guess that Obama is taking us down towards nazi germany same as Bush , Clinton , congress and all those other candidates that do not believe in the constitution . 
12494	2646	That 's the question that popped into my head vis - - vis you when my read that bizarre claim that Wall Street 's man Obama is some kind of `` populist '' . 
12497	2646	Obama has done nothing to address any fundamental problems with the U.S. economy . 
12498	2646	Obama did not re-instate any serious financial regulation , like the Glass-Steagall Act , which was repealed under the last right-wing Democratic president . 
12499	2646	Obama has done nothing to address any of the flawed `` free trade '' agreements which have driven out jobs and lowered standards ... also signed by Clinton . 
12500	2646	Rather Obama is instead pushing for new ones like KORUS , so American jobs can now be sent to North Korea too . 
12501	2646	Obama has done nothing to address the soaring costs of healthcare weighing on America 's economy , taking single-payer off the table before the whole fake `` debate '' over Obama DoleRomneyCare bill even began . 
12502	2646	Obama has accepted the Tea Party consensus that there is a `` debt crisis '' going on , and that programs like Medicare and Social Security are to blame for Security . 
12503	2646	Obama has accepted the idea that we need massive spending cuts even though we are in the middle of a depression and unemployment is already soaring . 
12504	2646	Meanwhile Obama has repeatedly made `` deals '' violating Obama own promise to even let the Bush tax cuts expire , never mind the idea of actually making serious reforms to the tax code so the rich might pay their fair share . 
12505	2646	On the whole , Obama does n't really represent any major shifts from the neoliberal economic policies that have characterized the past 30 years . 
12506	2646	If anything , Obama is more effective than Reagan and Bush at actually getting once-sacrosanct Democratic programs like Social Security onto the chopping block . 
12507	2646	Obama is black . 
12512	2646	Obama has doubled down on Bush 's radical neocon `` war on terror '' policies , both foreign and domestic . 
12513	2646	Well , my was n't getting into the specifics of Obama 's illegal war on Libya . 
12514	2646	my was simply making reference to Obama 's overall continuation of neoconservative foreign policy , just as Obama has continued neoliberal economic policy . 
12553	2659	I will have to vote for Obama , anyone that ALL the parties are mad at , must be doing something right . 
12569	2666	Looks good dont Prize ... '' Nobel Peace Prize President loses in landslide , , one term President '' LOL , , Labled worse ever , , tagged ... '' The DOWN GRADE President '' 10603 we are in agreement President Obama is not exclusive to corporate interests , President takes care of the middle class as well . 
12578	2672	Please , explain to me a few things \* Obama \* has done to help out the middle class ... and no , raising the unemployment rate does n't count ... and no extending unemployment compensation does not work either . 
12579	2673	If you are one of the 10 million unemployed by the great recession , you are getting some help with unemployment because of Obama . 
12581	2674	No , Obama cares exclusively about corporate interests . 
12582	2674	The middle class is being wiped out under Obama 's watch . 
12611	2681	Obama may not get many votes , but the ` Publican candidate will get even less . 
12618	2686	One less Obama vote . 
12619	2686	`` TEA Baggers and in Obama humble opinion Baggers are nothing but racist , anti-Muslim , screwballs `` There is no evidence .
