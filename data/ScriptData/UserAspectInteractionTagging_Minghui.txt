14	12	Folks have no idea how Palin would do , yet Folks would not vote for her , but Folks still have n't made up Folks minds about Obama , even though Obama has proven to be a disaster . 
18	13	we say NO because we know how Obama is trying to -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- we all . 
24	15	I 'll vote for Obama over any of the Republicans now in the field . 
25	15	Obama has kept Obama campaign promises . 
34	15	Obama has n't weakened security in any way . 
41	15	I am not aware of a single instance where Obama lied . 
42	15	As far as the BS goes , Obama is a politician and enemies all suffer from that a bit . 
55	22	Obama has done a pretty good job as President , so already your thread is a big fat fail . 
80	22	Never mind when Bush was doing depression , at least Obama is doing depression to help not help Bush , like Bush . 
88	23	This from someone that did n't worry about Bush 's spending , or the fact that Bush had a surplus and blew spending and handed Obama a deficit . 
89	23	And yes , Obama has strengthened ties with our allies and stoop up to our enemies , the fact that you are are n't aware of yes is because Obama does yes with finesse , not like the buffoon our had before . 
91	24	Obama 's approval rating is 47 % . 
92	24	Obama term average is 57 % The average for US Presidents -LRB- since FDR -RRB- is 55 % , so Obama is doing better than that . 
93	24	Your beloved Reagan had 44 % at the same time in office as Obama . 
94	24	-LRB- So Obama is doing better -RRB- . 
103	26	Your answers are that of a typical blind Obama sheep .

105	26	Obama will not keep Obama promise about tax cuts for 95 % of Americans . 
133	32	Obama is doing fine .

135	32	Palin criticized Obama for Obama stance on reducing nuclear weapons . 
137	32	So , Reagan , your idol was right , but Obama is wrong ?

149	35	thing is time for the right to quit trying to control what Obama does or does n't do , you had your chance and you blew thing , with Bush . 
154	35	Well , being that you have already been proven wrong -LRB- you said Obama had not been able to do anything Obama promised -RRB- , it is hard to believe anything the right says . 
162	38	In the subsequent segment , titled `` DANGEROUS RHETORIC : When heated words incite threats & violence , '' CNN 's panel agreed Obama 's political opponents are inciting violence and are motivated by racism -- undeterred by Palin 's assurance , which CNN played : When I talk about segment 's not a time to retreat , segment 's a time to reload , what I 'm talking about -- now , media , try to get this right , okay ? 
198	43	Unless Jesus runs against Jesus , I will be voting for Obama in 2012 . 
215	57	Most of your post is delusional , especially the part about Obama not having lied . 
233	64	You do realize that a lot of the disapproval comes from liberals who are upset with Obama for not ending the wars and not closing Gitmo , right ?

278	81	Kinda refutes the whole idea the right-wingers are espousing about how Obama is giving away jobs to Obama fellow blacks at the expense of the whites , does n't Kinda ? 
289	85	So its ok to call Palin names , but if I were to call Obama something racist , the out cry would be unbearable , racist an interesting stance you liberals take . 
305	94	So you do n't like Obama because Obama 's smarter than other people and Obama knows it ? 
311	96	Sorry Eldedu I was n't clear enugh for you I dislike Obama because Obama has not figure out who Obama wants to be yet and Obama does n't know it .

357	117	When Obama came on the scene the black people turned people backs on the Clintons people hated people , that 's who 297 Interesting . 
359	118	I do know that , when given the choice between HRC and Obama , Obama 's campaign began to quickly pick up the minority votes as choice became more viable . 
361	118	Obama was an interesting candidate , but not many think Obama could take HRC in the primary . 
362	118	HRC was only as the primary approached that primary appeared Obama could win primary . 
365	121	Thanks for the link , but I still do n't get your point : 306 Point is simple , Devil said back at I original chart that many white voters wont vote for Obama because of color .

403	133	, what you are looking at is the Bradley effect , only opposite ... When Furthermore go vote effect will be Obama , bet on effect . 
433	149	The only ones with their heads in the sand , are the desperate conservatives as conservatives try to convince the country that things are bad under Obama . 
444	153	Geez , like you have n't called Obama names ? 
446	154	Could it be because even dumb Sarah is able to recognize that Obama graduated from Harvard , Magna Cum Laude , while Sarah attended 5 colleges , and Sarah still does n't know much ?

469	155	Obama supports Israel .

473	155	html 401 Well , it is apparent that Republicans do not like Obama , but to take html to the level of lying about Obama presidency is totally wild . 
486	164	If Obama has let banks fail , and not pushed a stimulus of the size Obama did , we would currently be facing similar situations as took place in the 1920 's and 1930 's , runs on banks , 25-30 % unemployment , a return of the Hoovervilles . 
487	164	Obama , if for no other reason will be favorably looked upon 50-100 years from now as the one who had the courage to take a risk , and invest in America , instead of pulling everything in , and letting courage all die . 
517	167	economy depends on who is run against He , but the Obama administration has been a big positive change for America . 
531	172	The funny thing is that many folks knew that Obama was n't Presidential material , and now Obama has proved that Obama is not Presidential material , yet you drones still follow Obama like sheep heading toward a cliff . 
536	174	Bush , McCain , and Obama support amnesty . 
537	174	The fact remains that Obama has gone backward on enforcement . 
559	188	I 'm just happy with all the freebies and want to elect Obama for life . 
580	196	The poll question was `` Will you vote for Obama in 2012 ? '' 
581	196	not `` Is Obama fit to be President '' as you stated .

608	212	You mean you are really unaware that the Obama stimulus package included over $ 300 billion in tax cuts , and you are really unaware that the economy has gone from a -6 &#37; real annual growth rate to +6 % , job loss have gone from 700,000 losses to gains , the unemployment rate peaked and is now lower , productivity is now growing at 6 % , housing markets have stabilized and the stock markets are up 70 % since March ? 
610	212	No wonder you have such a negative view of Obama . 
630	216	Fact : Obama 's 1st term increased the national debt 4x more than Bush 's worst term . 
637	217	I am so tired of hearing about these tax cuts that the Obama has blessed us all with . 
647	217	Just as simply declaring that Obama 's so called stimulus turned the economy around and brought us out of recession did n't make stimulus so either . 
692	227	Do n't buy into the false numbers Obama likes to throw around . 
695	229	Bwhahahahahaha 584 Bush is even more reasonable for tax hikes needed in the future than Obama . 
696	229	Prescription drug plan Bwhahahahahaha did n't even attempt to pay for 584 , Obama atleast has tried . 
702	231	Now that you 've been informed about the status of Obama 's tax cuts and economic performance , apparently for the first time , do you really believe that GDP , productivity , unemployment and the like are numbers Obama created ? 
712	234	statement portends well for Obama in the future . 
749	243	You keep blaming Obama , but everyone knows it was Bush that tanked the country .

758	245	Obama still has 2.5 years to find Obama footing . 
760	245	Who do you like for running against Obama ? 
762	247	It 's Obama and Obama ideas that fell short , and It can not be blamed on racism . 
763	248	Bush had some spending issues , and Bush unfortunately , had some bailouts of Bush own , but Obama took spending\/deficit creation to a whole new level . 
768	250	Palin and Obama are n't apples to apples comparison . 
774	253	The prosperity and growth of America means nothing , just like Obama . 
775	254	You are correct , Palin was ten times more qualified for the presidency than Obama . 
776	254	ten simply unfair to lower her to Obama level of incompetence and idiocy . 
781	258	Obama is nowhere near the bottom of the `` dumb '' pile along with your group - enjoy your sour grapes !
