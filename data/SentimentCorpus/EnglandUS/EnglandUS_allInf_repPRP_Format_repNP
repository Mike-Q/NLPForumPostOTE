162	31	`` Rationing was introduced into Britain at ASPECT_TALE_END of ASPECT_WORLD_WAR_ONE - in ASPECT_FEBRUARY_1918 .
163	31	Rationing was introduced in response to effective ASPECT_U-BOAT_CAMPAIGN and during ASPECT_WORLD_WAR_ONE , Defense of ASPECT_REALM_ACT -LRB- ASPECT_DORA_-RRB- was used to ensure that ASPECT_FOOD_SHORTAGES never occurred .
164	31	One of ASPECT_PRIMARY_AIMS of DORA , when DORA was first introduced , was to prevent ASPECT_FOOD_SHORTAGES .
165	31	At start of war , ASPECT_FOOD_SHORTAGES were self-imposed as ASPECT_GERMAN_U-BOAT_CAMPAIGN had yet to start .
166	31	However , at start of ASPECT_WAR_PEOPLE went around panic buying ASPECT_FOOD_and ASPECT_HOARDING_START at home .

175	31	In ASPECT_APRIL_1916 , Britain only had six ASPECT_WEEKS of wheat left and bread was ASPECT_STAPLE_PART of diets .
176	31	1916 was bleak ASPECT_YEAR for families - with news from Battle of Somme and with food in short ASPECT_SUPPLY , suddenly war was brought home to families .
177	31	ASPECT_FOOD_PRICES rose and by ASPECT_OCTOBER_1916 , coal was in short ASPECT_SUPPLY that OCTOBER was rationed by of rooms family had in ASPECT_OCTOBER_HOUSE .
178	31	restrictions introduced by DORA failed and government then tried to introduce ASPECT_VOLUNTARY_CODE of rationing whereby people limited ASPECT_PEOPLE to what ASPECT_PEOPLE should eat .

455	54	To state that origin of intelligence and INTELLIGENCE ASPECT_EDUCATION are impartial to ASPECT_INTELLECTUAL_OWNERSHIP of invention is ridiculous .

477	54	Maybe so , but EU is not nation .
478	54	nation is merely ASPECT_GROUP of people bound together by ASPECT_COMMON_TRAIT ; such as coming ASPECT_FORM Europe .
479	54	GROUP is not state or country , but GROUP equates to ASPECT_U._S_FEDERATION in terms of resources available to GROUP .
480	55	I agree with your ASPECT_POINTS , but please stop tagging your ASPECT_ARGUMENTS as USA .
481	56	EU has highest ASPECT_GDP in world .
482	56	countries of ASPECT_NORTH_AMERICA have higher combined ASPECT_GDP than of England , but does AMERICA really make sense to compare group of economies to ASPECT_SINGLE_ECONOMY ?
483	56	Of course , there are connections between ASPECT_EU_MEMBER_COUNTRIES than of members of NAFTA but fact remains : you are combining group of countries to gain ability to surpass one .
484	56	significance I can see in comparing economy of EU to economy of US is that SIGNIFICANCE takes of ASPECT_EU_MEMBER_COUNTRIES to equal ASPECT_SINGLE_AMERICAN_ECONOMY .
485	56	train versus two of largest and important ASPECT_BUILDINGS in ASPECT_UNITED_STATES ?
486	56	Please do not pretend as if relatively ASPECT_PROPORTIONAL_EVENT could not have occurred in England .
487	56	absence of attack does not render possibility of ASPECT_PAST_ATTACK impossible or even improbable .
488	56	If England was as great ASPECT_TARGET as ASPECT_UNITED_STATES , ASPECT_ENGLAND_DOUBTFUL to believe that England would not have been attacked .
489	57	countries of ASPECT_NORTH_AMERICA have higher combined ASPECT_GDP than of England , but does AMERICA really make sense to compare group of economies to ASPECT_SINGLE_ECONOMY ?
490	57	is irrelevant .
491	57	I was refuting notion that ASPECT_U._S has highest ASPECT_GDP , which S does not .
492	58	I was refuting notion that ASPECT_U._S has highest ASPECT_GDP , which S does not .
493	58	In ASPECT_SEPARATE_POST on topic you said that `` nation is merely ASPECT_GROUP of people bound together by ASPECT_COMMON_TRAIT .
494	58	question that I have to ask is : what is ASPECT_COMMON_TRAIT between ASPECT_INTERNATIONAL_TRADING_BLOC with population of 500 ASPECT_MILLION and country divided into states has population of 300 ASPECT_MILLION .
495	58	If ASPECT_EUROPEAN_UNION `` equates to ASPECT_U._S_FEDERATION in terms of resources available to UNION , then how is there ASPECT_DIFFERENCE of 200 ASPECT_MILLION in relation to of ASPECT_POSSIBLE_CONSUMERS in country ?
496	59	what is ASPECT_COMMON_TRAIT between ASPECT_INTERNATIONAL_TRADING_BLOC with population of 500 ASPECT_MILLION and country divided into states has population of 300 ASPECT_MILLION .
497	59	One hardly needs to be supplied , as it was never inferred that they were nation .
498	59	If ASPECT_EUROPEAN_UNION `` equates to ASPECT_U._S_FEDERATION in terms of resources available to UNION , then how is there ASPECT_DIFFERENCE of 200 ASPECT_MILLION in relation to of ASPECT_POSSIBLE_CONSUMERS in country ?
499	59	Resources are quite opposite to consumers .
500	60	One hardly needs to be supplied , as it was never inferred that they were nation .
501	60	How is that ASPECT_COMMON_TRAIT ?
502	60	Resources are quite opposite to consumers .
503	60	higher ASPECT_POPULATION means ASPECT_HUMAN_CAPITAL for labor .
504	60	ASPECT_HUMAN_CAPITAL generates money and , along with higher ASPECT_POPULATION , creates consumers who increase GDP .
