Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	In today's world if a country owes you money you have power over them, you cant honestly say you people did it without the intention of making a profit,Of course we made a profit from it, but that doesn't negate the fact that it helped your country when it desperately needed it.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	So don't go claiming we didn't help you, when we obviously did.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	also you only sold us food because your farmers produced too much, same goes for all your other mass-produced goods.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	And guess what?
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	There are about 250 to 350 other counties we could have sold it to.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	Iraq, the war we(Britain) are fighting now.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	I don't know if you've been watching the news (or maybe that is the problem) but we are still in Iraq.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	We never left.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	We have about 48,000 American troops in Iraq at this moment.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	Guess how many British troops are in Iraq?
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	Go ahead guess!
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	There are as of spring 2010, 150 british troops in Iraq.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	Let me repeat that: 150 british troops in Iraq.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	That's 150 British troops, to our 48,000 troops.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	Your statement was utterly absurd to the greatest degree.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	I'm sorry, who is fighting the Iraq war again?

Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	you sold us food thats not really helping.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	"Rationing was introduced into Britain at the tale end of World War One - in February 1918.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	Rationing was introduced in response to an effective U-boat campaign and during World War One, the Defence of the Realm Act (DORA) was used to ensure that food shortages never occurred.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	One of the primary aims of DORA, when it was first introduced, was to prevent food shortages.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	At the start of the war, food shortages were self-imposed as the German U-boat campaign had yet to start.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	However, at the start of the war people went around panic buying food and hoarding it at home.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	Some shops sold out of food in days in August 1914.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	However, after the initial panic buying, people settled down into a routine and food was not a problem until the end of 1916.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	Britain continued to import food during the war.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	The main exporters to Britain were America and Canada.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	This meant that merchant ships had to cross the Atlantic Ocean.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	Up to 1916, these merchant ships could travel in relative safety.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	However, in 1917, the Germans introduced unrestricted submarine warfare and merchant ships were sunk with great frequency.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	This had a drastic impact on Britain's food supply and with great losses in the Atlantic, food had to be rationed so that no-one starved in Britain.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	In April 1916, Britain only had six weeks of wheat left and bread was a staple part of most diets.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	1916 was a bleak year for families - with the news from the Battle of the Somme and with food in short supply, suddenly the war was brought home to most families.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	Food prices rose and by October 1916, coal was in such short supply that it was rationed by the number of rooms a family had in its house.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	The restrictions introduced by DORA failed and the government then tried to introduce a voluntary code of rationing whereby people limited themselves to what they should eat.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	The standard was set by the Royal Family.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	However, this did not work.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	Those who worked in the munitions factories did not have enough food while anyone with money could get more than enough food on the black market.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	Any area that could grow food was converted to do so - gardens were turned into allotments and chickens etc.  were kept in back gardens.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	The powers introduced by DORA empowered the government to take over land when it felt that it was necessary to do so.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	In 1917, the government took over 2.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	5 million acres of land for farming.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	By the end of the war, Britain had an extra three million acres of farming land.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	Those who would have usually worked the land - young men - had been called up, so the work was done by the Women's Land Army.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	Conscientious objectors also worked on the land.

Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	The stock market crash of 1929 is usually credited as the cause of the Great Depression but the Dust Bowl certainly didn't help.

Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	34	You made the claim that the food didn't help at all, and yet you feel the need to ignore the fact that extensive rationing and food shortages occurred in your country.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	34	Did you not say that you admit when you are not wrong?
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	34	Clearly the massive amounts of food imported into your country was much needed, or you navy wouldn't have had a need to defend our trade ships nor would Germany have felt the need to cut off your food supply.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	34	You are being very disingenuous here.

Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	34	You didn't even know there was a huge drought in the western United States during this time, nor would I expect you to, your educational system probably doesn't even teach about the Dust Bowl expect perhaps on a university level.
Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	34	You didn't even know about the exploitation of India, you thought that your country improved the conditions in India, when in truth your country we siphoning wealth from India and using their population as an expansion of your military force.

sirius	EnigmaticMan	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	56	The only significance that I can see in comparing the economy of the EU to the economy of the US is that it takes most of the EU member countries to equal the single American economy.

sirius	EnigmaticMan	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	60	A higher total population means more human capital for labor.
sirius	EnigmaticMan	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	60	The more human capital generates money and, along with the higher population, creates consumers who increase the GDP.
