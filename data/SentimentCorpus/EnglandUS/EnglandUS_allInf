100	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	27	Americans have literally invented hundreds if not thousands of words.
101	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	27	We use different words to describe the same things, and we use different spellings, which are not always shorter.
102	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	27	This is called a dialect.
103	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	27	English is an Amalgamation of German, French, and Latin words and the English you speak today is a corruption of middle English.
104	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	27	It is composed of many corruptions of words originating from other languages.
105	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	27	Example: England from Angle-land.
106	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	27	Slang is made of short-lived words used by distinct groups of people.
107	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	27	The very fact that all Americans have used these words for over a hundred years means it isn't slang.
108	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	27	I have met many "blind patriotic" americans on the internet who have to go as far back as the U. S revolution to find a war that they won on their own.
109	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	27	The internet is not representative of all people.
110	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	27	If I were to make conclusions based on my experiences on the internet then Ron Paul should have won the last presidential election and that atheists and agnostics are now the majority.
111	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	27	And the last war that the United States won without any aid, was the Spanish American war, as far as memory serves me.  Not that this means anything, wars are very expensive and bloody, having allies can reduce these burdens, from a military standpoint it makes absolutely no sense to go into a fight alone, unless you have to.
112	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	27	By the same right, I have met very few Brits on the internet that did not think their country the greatest.

123	Axmeister	Bohemian	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	28	English is an Amalgamation of German, French, and Latin words and the English you speak today is a corruption of middle English.
124	Axmeister	Bohemian	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	28	It is composed of many corruptions of words originating from other languages.
125	Axmeister	Bohemian	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	28	Example: England from Angle-land.
126	Axmeister	Bohemian	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	28	"I know how my country's language was formed . "Slang is made of short-lived words used by distinct groups of people.
127	Axmeister	Bohemian	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	28	The very fact that all Americans have used these words for over a hundred years means it isn't slang.
128	Axmeister	Bohemian	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	28	"So you copied our language and to individualise yourselves chose to only use the worst parts, you then proceed to force this language onto us, via the media.
129	Axmeister	Bohemian	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	28	in other words butchering our language.
130	Axmeister	Bohemian	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	28	The last point you made I have researched it and realised you're correct, my mistake.
131	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	In today's world if a country owes you money you have power over them, you cant honestly say you people did it without the intention of making a profit,Of course we made a profit from it, but that doesn't negate the fact that it helped your country when it desperately needed it.
132	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	So don't go claiming we didn't help you, when we obviously did.
133	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	also you only sold us food because your farmers produced too much, same goes for all your other mass-produced goods.
134	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	And guess what?
135	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	There are about 250 to 350 other counties we could have sold it to.
136	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	Iraq, the war we(Britain) are fighting now.
137	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	I don't know if you've been watching the news (or maybe that is the problem) but we are still in Iraq.
138	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	We never left.
139	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	We have about 48,000 American troops in Iraq at this moment.
140	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	Guess how many British troops are in Iraq?
141	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	Go ahead guess!
142	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	There are as of spring 2010, 150 british troops in Iraq.
143	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	Let me repeat that: 150 british troops in Iraq.
144	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	That's 150 British troops, to our 48,000 troops.
145	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	Your statement was utterly absurd to the greatest degree.
146	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	29	I'm sorry, who is fighting the Iraq war again?

155	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	you sold us food thats not really helping.
156	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	"Rationing was introduced into Britain at the tale end of World War One - in February 1918.
157	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	Rationing was introduced in response to an effective U-boat campaign and during World War One, the Defence of the Realm Act (DORA) was used to ensure that food shortages never occurred.
158	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	One of the primary aims of DORA, when it was first introduced, was to prevent food shortages.
159	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	At the start of the war, food shortages were self-imposed as the German U-boat campaign had yet to start.
160	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	However, at the start of the war people went around panic buying food and hoarding it at home.
161	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	Some shops sold out of food in days in August 1914.
162	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	However, after the initial panic buying, people settled down into a routine and food was not a problem until the end of 1916.
163	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	Britain continued to import food during the war.
164	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	The main exporters to Britain were America and Canada.
165	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	This meant that merchant ships had to cross the Atlantic Ocean.
166	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	Up to 1916, these merchant ships could travel in relative safety.
167	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	However, in 1917, the Germans introduced unrestricted submarine warfare and merchant ships were sunk with great frequency.
168	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	This had a drastic impact on Britain's food supply and with great losses in the Atlantic, food had to be rationed so that no-one starved in Britain.
169	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	In April 1916, Britain only had six weeks of wheat left and bread was a staple part of most diets.
170	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	1916 was a bleak year for families - with the news from the Battle of the Somme and with food in short supply, suddenly the war was brought home to most families.
171	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	Food prices rose and by October 1916, coal was in such short supply that it was rationed by the number of rooms a family had in its house.
172	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	The restrictions introduced by DORA failed and the government then tried to introduce a voluntary code of rationing whereby people limited themselves to what they should eat.
173	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	The standard was set by the Royal Family.
174	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	However, this did not work.
175	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	Those who worked in the munitions factories did not have enough food while anyone with money could get more than enough food on the black market.
176	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	Any area that could grow food was converted to do so - gardens were turned into allotments and chickens etc.  were kept in back gardens.
177	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	The powers introduced by DORA empowered the government to take over land when it felt that it was necessary to do so.
178	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	In 1917, the government took over 2.
179	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	5 million acres of land for farming.
180	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	By the end of the war, Britain had an extra three million acres of farming land.
181	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	Those who would have usually worked the land - young men - had been called up, so the work was done by the Women's Land Army.
182	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	Conscientious objectors also worked on the land.

202	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	34	You made the claim that the food didn't help at all, and yet you feel the need to ignore the fact that extensive rationing and food shortages occurred in your country.
