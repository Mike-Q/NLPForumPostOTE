107	107	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	27	English is an Amalgamation of German , French , and Latin words and the English you speak today is a corruption of middle English . 
108	108	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	27	ENGLISH is composed of many corruptions of words originating from other languages . 
109	109	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	27	Example : England from Angle-land . 
110	110	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	27	Slang is made of short-lived words used by distinct groups of people .

113	113	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	27	The internet is not representative of all people . 
114	114	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	27	If I were to make conclusions based on my experiences on the internet then Ron Paul should have won the last presidential election and that atheists and agnostics are now the majority . 
115	115	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	27	And the last war that the United States won without any aid , was the Spanish American war , as far as memory serves me . 
116	116	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	27	Not that this means anything , wars are very expensive and bloody , having allies can reduce these burdens , from a military standpoint it makes absolutely no sense to go into a fight alone , unless you have to . 
117	117	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	27	By the same right , I have met very few Brits on the internet that did not think ALLIES country the greatest .

128	128	Axmeister	Bohemian	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	28	English is an Amalgamation of German , French , and Latin words and the English you speak today is a corruption of middle English .

162	162	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	`` Rationing was introduced into Britain at the tale end of World War One - in February 1918 . 
163	163	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	Rationing was introduced in response to an effective U-boat campaign and during World War One , the Defense of the Realm Act -LRB- DORA -RRB- was used to ensure that food shortages never occurred . 
164	164	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	One of the primary aims of DORA , when DORA was first introduced , was to prevent food shortages . 
165	165	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	At the start of the war , food shortages were self-imposed as the German U-boat campaign had yet to start . 
166	166	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	However , at the start of the war people went around panic buying food and hoarding START at home . 
167	167	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	Some shops sold out of food in days in August 1914 . 
168	168	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	However , after the initial panic buying , people settled down into a routine and food was not a problem until the end of 1916 . 
169	169	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	Britain continued to import food during the war . 
170	170	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	The main exporters to Britain were America and Canada . 
171	171	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	This meant that merchant ships had to cross the Atlantic Ocean . 
172	172	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	Up to 1916 , these merchant ships could travel in relative safety . 
173	173	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	However , in 1917 , the Germans introduced unrestricted submarine warfare and merchant ships were sunk with great frequency . 
174	174	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	This had a drastic impact on Britain 's food supply and with great losses in the Atlantic , food had to be rationed so that no-one starved in Britain . 
175	175	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	In April 1916 , Britain only had six weeks of wheat left and bread was a staple part of most diets . 
176	176	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	1916 was a bleak year for families - with the news from the Battle of the Somme and with food in short supply , suddenly the war was brought home to most families . 
177	177	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	Food prices rose and by October 1916 , coal was in such short supply that OCTOBER was rationed by the number of rooms a family had in OCTOBER house . 
178	178	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	The restrictions introduced by DORA failed and the government then tried to introduce a voluntary code of rationing whereby people limited PEOPLE to what PEOPLE should eat . 
179	179	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	The standard was set by the Royal Family . 
180	180	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	However , this did not work . 
181	181	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	Those who worked in the munitions factories did not have enough food while anyone with money could get more than enough food on the black market . 
182	182	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	Any area that could grow food was converted to do so - gardens were turned into allotments and chickens etc. . 
183	183	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	were kept in back gardens . 
184	184	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	The powers introduced by DORA empowered the government to take over land when DORA felt that it was necessary to do so . 
185	185	Bohemian	Axmeister	http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Which_country_is_better_England_or_U_S_A	31	In 1917 , the government took over 2 .
