115	27	And the last war that the United States won without any aid , was the Spanish American war , as far as memory serves me . 
116	27	Not that this means anything , wars are very expensive and bloody , having allies can reduce these burdens , from a military standpoint it makes absolutely no sense to go into a fight alone , unless you have to .

162	31	`` Rationing was introduced into Britain at the tale end of World War One - in February 1918 . 
163	31	Rationing was introduced in response to an effective U-boat campaign and during World War One , the Defense of the Realm Act -LRB- DORA -RRB- was used to ensure that food shortages never occurred . 
164	31	One of the primary aims of DORA , when DORA was first introduced , was to prevent food shortages . 
165	31	At the start of the war , food shortages were self-imposed as the German U-boat campaign had yet to start . 
166	31	However , at the start of the war people went around panic buying food and hoarding START at home . 
167	31	Some shops sold out of food in days in August 1914 . 
168	31	However , after the initial panic buying , people settled down into a routine and food was not a problem until the end of 1916 . 
169	31	Britain continued to import food during the war . 
170	31	The main exporters to Britain were America and Canada . 
171	31	This meant that merchant ships had to cross the Atlantic Ocean . 
172	31	Up to 1916 , these merchant ships could travel in relative safety . 
173	31	However , in 1917 , the Germans introduced unrestricted submarine warfare and merchant ships were sunk with great frequency . 
174	31	This had a drastic impact on Britain 's food supply and with great losses in the Atlantic , food had to be rationed so that no-one starved in Britain . 
175	31	In April 1916 , Britain only had six weeks of wheat left and bread was a staple part of most diets . 
176	31	1916 was a bleak year for families - with the news from the Battle of the Somme and with food in short supply , suddenly the war was brought home to most families . 
177	31	Food prices rose and by October 1916 , coal was in such short supply that OCTOBER was rationed by the number of rooms a family had in OCTOBER house . 
178	31	The restrictions introduced by DORA failed and the government then tried to introduce a voluntary code of rationing whereby people limited PEOPLE to what PEOPLE should eat . 
179	31	The standard was set by the Royal Family . 
180	31	However , this did not work . 
181	31	Those who worked in the munitions factories did not have enough food while anyone with money could get more than enough food on the black market . 
182	31	Any area that could grow food was converted to do so - gardens were turned into allotments and chickens etc. . 
183	31	were kept in back gardens . 
184	31	The powers introduced by DORA empowered the government to take over land when DORA felt that it was necessary to do so . 
185	31	In 1917 , the government took over 2 . 
186	31	5 million acres of land for farming . 
187	31	By the end of the war , Britain had an extra three million acres of farming land . 
188	31	Those who would have usually worked the land - young men - had been called up , so the work was done by the Women 's Land Army . 
189	31	Conscientious objectors also worked on the land .

402	51	You 're comparing 1 Nation to 47 nations . 
403	52	Atomic bombThe Manhattan Project was an international effort comprising 30 research sites across the U. S , Canada and Britain . 
404	52	The entire affair would have been impossible without Dalton 's atomic theory -LRB- English -RRB- and the discovery of the Neutron by James Chadwick .

406	52	RadarThe first functioning RADAR system was created by an American named Robert Page , but the theory , the first demonstration of radio waves , and the first employment of radar were European .

412	52	Solar cell , Cell phones , Cash register , Radiocarbon dating , Micro-processors , traffic lights , MRI machine , Compact Disc , Lunar module , artificial hearts , All of which are entirely useless or non-functional without the electrical generator , which was ours . 
413	52	Also I 'm fairly certain the Machine gun , was invented in the United States , both the hand cranked Gatling gun and the automatic maxim Gun . 
414	52	The puckle gun outdates both . 
415	52	Maxim was born in the United States , but lived in Britain , which is where MAXIM was educated and invented the maxim gun . 
416	52	You 're comparing 1 Nation to 47 nations . 
417	52	I 'm comparing them to one nation composed of 51 states , most of which are larger than any European country . 
418	53	The Manhattan Project was an international effortNonsense ! 
419	53	`` In 1939 U. S. scientists urged Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt to establish a program to study the potential military use of fission , and $ 6,000 was appropriated . 
420	53	By 1942 the project was code-named Manhattan , after the site of Columbia University , where much of the early research was done . 
421	53	Research also was carried out at the University of California and the University of Chicago . 
422	53	In 1943 a laboratory to construct the bomb was established at Los Alamos , N. M. `` http:\/\/www . 
424	53	com\/topic\/manhattan-projectIt was funded by US tax dollars . 
425	53	Research , construction , and testing all occurred in the United states . 
426	53	That some foreign scientists aided the project does not make MANHATTAN an international effort . 
427	53	The first fixed-wing aircraft was French and aerodynamics was invented by Sir George Cayley , who was English . 
428	53	And yet the first successful aircraft ever built was built by the Wright brothers in North Carolina . 
429	53	This is undeniable . 
430	53	The first functioning RADAR system was created by an American named Robert Page , but the theoryExcept we are n't talking about theories , we are talking about inventions . 
431	53	And this invention came from the United states . 
432	53	Impossible without the manufactory , which was an English invention . 
433	53	Which in no way makes MANUFACTORY NOT an American invention . 
434	53	US could just as easily use the same tactic to undermine most of your English inventions . 
435	53	Well , we invented the computer , so we 'll call that one a joint effort . 
436	53	You could call COMPUTER that , but you 'd be wrong . 
437	53	Personal Computers , were developed by an American , to put the power of computers into anybody 's home . 
438	53	We invented the World Wide Web . 
439	53	And we invented the Internet . 
440	53	and yes there is a difference . 
441	53	We have the flushing toiletGood luck using it without TP . 
442	53	The press was German ; a man by the name of Johannes Gutenberg . 
443	53	Excuse US , US meant to say the Rotary Printing Press , which was invented by Richard m. Hoe , an American . 
444	53	All of which are entirely useless or non-functional without the electrical generator , which was oursWhich would have been useless without the discovery of electricity . 
445	53	See , two can play at that game , yes ? 
446	53	Nearly every invention is based on some previous invention , innovation , or scientific discovery . 
447	53	US could break any invention down to INVENTION 's fundamental parts , and attribute those discoveries to other nations , but this does nothing to dispute the fact that these were in fact American discoveries , things we use everyday . 
448	53	The puckle gun outdates both . 
449	53	The Puckle gun was nothing more than an oversized revolver and what a glorious failure that was ! 
450	53	US 'm comparing them to one nation composed of 51 states , most of which are larger than any European countryMaybe so , but the EU is not a nation . 
452	54	By what novel historical insight you contrive to label this truth nonsense , I can not conceive . 
453	54	That some foreign scientists aided the project does not make PROJECT an international effort . 
454	54	The means by which a nation devises new technologies is intelligence coupled with science . 
455	54	To state that the origin of that intelligence and INTELLIGENCE education are impartial to the intellectual ownership of an invention is ridiculous . 
456	54	And yet the first successful aircraft ever built was built by the Wright brothers in North Carolina . 
457	54	From what I understand , the French aircraft flew successfully . 
458	54	The means may have been a horse tied to the vehicle , but HORSE was flight nonetheless . 
459	54	Except we are n't talking about theories , we are talking about inventions . 
460	54	To invent the functional concept of RADAR is to invent RADAR . 
461	54	Building one is entirely separate . 
462	54	Which in no way makes BUILDING NOT an American invention . 
463	54	The means of running a factory efficiently is not a tangible invention . 
464	54	You have taken RADAR based on the first construction of a RADAR device , yet now you abandon that principle ? 
465	54	And we invented the Internet . 
466	54	and yes there is a difference . 
467	54	I am aware of the difference . 
468	54	The email would be useless to 99 % of the world 's population without a public internet . 
469	54	Good luck using ISSUE without TP . 
470	54	That was n't really an issue for the billions of people to have lived before 1857 . 
471	54	Besides , we made moist toilet paper , which is far more hygienic and . 
473	54	Nearly every invention is based on some previous invention , innovation , or scientific discovery . 
474	54	I could break any invention down to INVENTION 's fundamental parts , and attribute those discoveries to other nationsRendering this entire childish pissing contest obsolete . 
475	54	The Puckle gun was nothing more than an oversized revolver and what a glorious failure that was ! 
477	54	Maybe so , but the EU is not a nation . 
478	54	A nation is merely a group of people bound together by a common trait ; such as coming form Europe . 
479	54	GROUP is not a state or a country , but GROUP equates to the U. S federation in terms of the resources available to GROUP . 
480	55	I agree with all your points , but please stop tagging your arguments as USA . 
481	56	The EU has the highest GDP in the world . 
482	56	The countries of North America have a higher combined GDP than that of England , but does AMERICA really make sense to compare a group of economies to a single economy ? 
483	56	Of course , there are more connections between the EU member countries than that of the members of the NAFTA but the fact remains : you are combining a group of countries to gain the ability to surpass one . 
484	56	The only significance that I can see in comparing the economy of the EU to the economy of the US is that SIGNIFICANCE takes most of the EU member countries to equal the single American economy . 
485	56	A train versus two of the largest and most important buildings in the United States ? 
486	56	Please do not pretend as if the same relatively proportional event could not have occurred in England . 
487	56	The absence of an attack does not render the possibility of a past attack impossible or even improbable . 
488	56	If England was as great a target as the United States , ENGLAND doubtful to believe that England would not have been attacked . 
489	57	The countries of North America have a higher combined GDP than that of England , but does AMERICA really make sense to compare a group of economies to a single economy ? 
490	57	That is irrelevant . 
491	57	I was refuting the notion that the U. S has the highest GDP , which S does not . 
492	58	I was refuting the notion that the U. S has the highest GDP , which S does not . 
493	58	In a separate post on the same topic you said that `` a nation is merely a group of people bound together by a common trait '' . 
494	58	A question that I have to ask is : what is the common trait between an international trading bloc with a population of 500 million and a country divided into states that has a population of 300 million . 
495	58	If the European Union `` equates to the U. S federation in terms of the resources available to UNION '' , then how is there a difference of 200 million in relation to the number of possible consumers in each country ? 
496	59	what is the common trait between an international trading bloc with a population of 500 million and a country divided into states that has a population of 300 million . 
497	59	One hardly needs to be supplied , as it was never inferred that they were the same nation . 
498	59	If the European Union `` equates to the U. S federation in terms of the resources available to UNION '' , then how is there a difference of 200 million in relation to the number of possible consumers in each country ? 
499	59	Resources are quite the opposite to consumers . 
500	60	One hardly needs to be supplied , as it was never inferred that they were the same nation . 
501	60	How is that a common trait ? 
502	60	Resources are quite the opposite to consumers . 
503	60	A higher total population means more human capital for labor . 
504	60	The more human capital generates money and , along with the higher population , creates consumers who increase the GDP .
