CURRENTPOSTID 5
I 'm not taking a stance on a 1\/4 of a term . 
When his term is over , I 'll give an answer . 
CURRENTPOSTID 6
Would you vote for Palin ? 
CURRENTPOSTID 7
Start providing some facts to back up HE statements . 
Even if some are true , that does n't mean he or SOME are wrong , only that conservatives do not agree . 
CURRENTPOSTID 8
Are you freakin ' nutz ? 
Palin is a BIMBO ! 
CURRENTPOSTID 9
So you 'll take a stance on Palin ... already made up your mind ... but STANCE 's to early to take a stance on Obama ??? 
That 's pretty funny ... 
CURRENTPOSTID 11
Why would you agree with any of what I listed , assuming they are all correct ? 
CURRENTPOSTID 12
That was the point I was proving . 
Folks have no idea how Palin would do , yet FOLKS would not vote for her , but FOLKS still have n't made up FOLKS minds about Obama , even though OBAMA has proven to be a disaster . 
CURRENTPOSTID 13
Hands-on ? 
Begin to soar ? 
LOL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
WE say NO because we know how Obama is trying to -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- WE all . 
CURRENTPOSTID 14
No I would not . 
And I know what you 're trying to do . 
I vehemently disagree with her . 
With Obama , I have to take more of a wait and see approach . 
Some things I have liked and others I have n't , so I 'll wait . 
CURRENTPOSTID 15
I 'll vote for Obama over any of the Republicans now in the field . 
Obama has kept OBAMA campaign promises . 
OBAMA has n't gotten everything through yet , but CAMPAIGN 's early in OBAMA term . 
I do n't watch Fox so I have no trouble keeping up with what FOX 's doing .95 % of Americans got a tax cut this year and last . 
Does your 95 % include the world or something ? 
I do n't have a problem with the spending ; I know where PROBLEM 's going . 
PROBLEM 's way too early to worry about the deficit . 
PEOPLE are n't the people . 
Obama was legitimately elected as was congress . 
They 're doing what THEY said THEY 'd do while campaigning . 
Obama has n't weakened security in any way . 
I do n't watch Fox so I know about the terrorist plots that were just thwarted . 
Finally , Pakistan is going after Al Qaeda on THEY side of the border . 
That 's a pretty big coup . 
FOX has neither proposed nor passed any legislature that hurts Americans . 
FOX has strengthened the ties with our traditional allies . 
FOX has stood up to OUR enemies . 
I am not aware of a single instance where Obama lied . 
As far as the BS goes , Obama is a politician and ENEMIES all suffer from that a bit . 
CURRENTPOSTID 16
Actually if you notice , Sly already participated in the poll ... so not so funny .

Honestly I do n't know how you could possibly expect any Congress or President to give up their salary until every American got a job , which to I knowledge has never happened in the history of this country .

You 're not worried about the spending .

Wow ... just wow .

Obama has done a pretty good job as President , so already your thread is a big fat fail . 
And , as far as going down as the worst president surpassing Carter - I believe Georgie boy has already done that . 
And , this was a Rasmussen poll -LRB- right-leaning poll -RRB- - so , your second pronouncements is also erroneous . 
Do conservatives ever get anything right ?

One of America 's leading historians assesses George W. BushSEAN WILENTZPosted Apr 21 , 2006 12:34 PMFlashback : Bush in '99 -- We Warned You ! 
George W. Bush 's presidency appears headed for colossal historical disgrace . 
Gee , conservatives expected BUSH to accomplish all BUSH promises by Jan 21 , 2009 , so of course CONSERVATIVES are disappointed . 
More so than Bush . 
Another lie . 
ANOTHER has not raised taxes . 
To undo what George Bush did - and it has helped . 
We 'd be in a depression if a Republican was in office . 
Never mind when Bush was doing DEPRESSION , at least Obama is doing DEPRESSION to help not help BUSH , like Bush . 
Bwahaha , BWAHAHA ignores the Party of No and all NO followers , uses same tactics used by Republicans , which I guess FOLLOWERS have forgotten . 
Another big fat lie being propagated by GOP . 
Another big fat lie . 
BWAHAHA has done more for world peace than that Bozo , war monger Bush ever did . 
We had more enemies because of Bush . 
The Republican party and REPUBLICAN cohorts , i.e. Fox News , Sarah Palin , Limbaugh and the motley crew at Faux News are the ones spewing lies . 
Hell yes , ten times over any republican clown the GOP puts up . 
CURRENTPOSTID 23
This from someone that did n't worry about Bush 's spending , or the fact that Bush had a surplus and blew SPENDING and handed Obama a deficit . 
And yes , Obama has strengthened ties with our allies and stoop up to OUR enemies , the fact that you are are n't aware of YES is because OBAMA does YES with finesse , not like the buffoon OUR had before . 
i.e. Bush = `` I.E. 'm the Decider '' ! 
CURRENTPOSTID 24
Obama 's approval rating is 47 % . 
OBAMA term average is 57 % The average for US Presidents -LRB- since FDR -RRB- is 55 % , so OBAMA is doing better than that . 
Your beloved Reagan had 44 % at the same time in office as Obama . 
-LRB- So Obama is doing better -RRB- . 
Maybe you should open your eyes . 
What is dangerous for America is the GOP with all AMERICA whackos . 
Beginning with Sarah Palin , Michele Bachmann , the Tea Baggers and other 's who have advocated violence , who makes inciting comments like `` Do n't retreat - reload '' and `` Next time YOU 'll come armed '' . 
What a bunch of uncivilized nitwits . 
Who are you that US should worry about being penalized ? 
CURRENTPOSTID 25
Not really . 
Their salaries are a stipend . 
STIPEND 's all about power . 
CURRENTPOSTID 26
Your answers are that of a typical blind Obama sheep . 
OBAMA will be the worst President . 
OBAMA will not keep OBAMA promise about tax cuts for 95 % of Americans . 
OBAMA HCR bill is proof of that . 
OBAMA wants the VAT for Christ 's sake . 
What do you think that is ? 
OBAMA DOHS has stopped enforcing immigration laws . 
They have tied the hands of local law enforcement agencies in seeking illegal aliens . 
DOHS has cut border agents . 
DOHS has weakened our border security , thus , or national security . 
Cap & Tax is next , then amnesty . 
Destructive for America . 
None of what I said are lies . 
You will see . 
CURRENTPOSTID 27
Obama is on OBAMA way down . 
The Tea Party folks are Americans of all walks of life . 
Open your eyes . 
FOLKS have not advocated violence - you lie there .

HE is an utter failure and a fraud . 
CURRENTPOSTID 32
So that is how conservatives vote ? 
Wondering how someone would do ? 
Interesting , no wonder THAT voted in Bush . 
Palin has already proven herself to not know much . 
Why would anyone with a brain consider HERSELF `` just to see how HERSELF would do '' ? 
HERSELF would totally destroy the country , that is how HERSELF would do . 
Obama is doing fine . 
The only ones finding fault with the things OBAMA is doing are the neo-cons , right-wing , tea baggers , not much to consider . 
Palin criticized Obama for OBAMA stance on reducing nuclear weapons . 
Did she even bother to check that Reagan was trying to do the same thing ? 
So , Reagan , your idol was right , but Obama is wrong ? 
Bwahaha - just goes to show conservatives do n't know much about anything except complaining . 
CURRENTPOSTID 33
Of course not , that is why poster claimed they would vote for Obama . 
All the right-wingers can do is whine and cry and belly-ache , because THEY are not in power . 
I wonder if BELLY-ACHE would require the same of a Rep ? 
I wonder if a Rep would even consider any of REP requests ? 
NOT ! 
CURRENTPOSTID 34
Not to mention insane ! 
CURRENTPOSTID 35
That said from someone whose posts exhibit total ovine behavior - BAAAAAAAA ! 
THAT doubt that anyone will topple Bush out of that position . 
HCR is the best thing that could have happened to this country . 
As THING is refined , more and more people -LRB- except the right-wing sheep -RRB- will be able to see and Obama will get the credit OBAMA deserves . 
THING is time for the right to quit trying to control what Obama does or does n't do , you had your chance and you blew THING , with Bush . 
The same sing-song sung by the right . 
Enough with the racial profiling , fence building and other non-sensical methods applied by the right . 
There are other ways to destroy America , and that would be to hand control over to the right . 
Bush did n't have cap & trade and BUSH nearly destroyed the US . 
Well , being that you have already been proven wrong -LRB- you said Obama had not been able to do anything OBAMA promised -RRB- , it is hard to believe anything the right says . 
CURRENTPOSTID 37
Rove is a liar . 
It 's all ROVE ever does . 
CURRENTPOSTID 38
You 've been saying that since Jan 21 , 2009 ! 
His ratings are going up , so enough of your lies . 
As long as Palin and the rest of the conservatives keep denying REST , REST will continue . 
I 'm sure most conservatives are aware of what is going on , but CONSERVATIVES play the innocent card , and pretend that what CONSERVATIVES do does not incite violence . 
Maybe you need to take your own advice and open `` your '' eyes . 
In the subsequent segment , titled DANGEROUS RHETORIC : When heated words incite threats & violence , CNN s panel agreed Obama s political opponents are inciting violence and are motivated by racism -- undeterred by Palin s assurance , which CNN played : When I talk about SEGMENT 's not a time to retreat , SEGMENT 's a time to reload , what I 'm talking about -- now , media , try to get this right , okay ? 
That 's not inciting violence . 
What that 's doing is trying to inspire people to get involved in PEOPLE local elections and these upcoming federal elections . 
SEGMENT 's telling people that PEOPLE arms are PEOPLE votes . 
SEGMENT 's not inciting violence . 
SEGMENT 's telling people , do n't ever let anybody tell you to sit down and shut up , Americans . 
Lemon demanded : Is LEMON responsible for someone to say that ? 
Especially a leader , considering the anger that 's going on right now ? 
Read more : http:\/\/newsbusters.org\/blogs\/brent-b...#ixzz0lPKYdBNLAnother example : Like disobeying orders from the Commander in Chief ? 
If not violent , then just total whackos ? 
Is n't this just plain treason , and ignored by your party . 
Are these the kinds of idiots we need in the military ? 
In promoting the Armed Forces Tea Party Patriots , Stein has raised the possibility of disobeying presidential orders . 
In one recent online posting , STEIN wrote : I oath was to the Constitution , not to the politicians , and that oath will be kept . 
I wo n't `` Just follow '' orders . 
There is at this time a debate within the ranks of the military regarding POLITICIANS oath . 
Some mistakenly believe SOME must follow any order the President issues . 
But many others do understand that OTHERS loyalty is to the Constitution and to the people ... That declaration echoes one made by the Oath Keepers , a group of current and former military and law enforcement personnel who havevowed not to follow orders deemed to be unconstitutional -- including any orders to disarm Americans . 
Stein agreed that the two groups are kindred spirits . 
`` STEIN think GROUPS 're very like-minded with the Oathkeepers , '' STEIN said . 
`` STEIN strongly support the Oathkeepers . 
`` Stein 's political activism seems to have raised some concern among STEIN superiors . 
Late last month , STEIN wrote online : `` Was just told by a Marine Corps Officer to watch what STEIN say about Obama ... STEIN think not ... '' And later that same day : `` STEIN was just told to keep STEIN opinons -LRB- sic -RRB- to STEIN about Obama , by STEIN Officer-in-Charge -LRB- OIC -RRB- . 
`` Indeed , Stein may be violating military policies that restrict political statements and activities by active duty personnel . 
`` LEBOWITZ 've seen military command go against people on a lot less , '' Mike Lebowitz , a former JAG lawyer who 's an expert on issues of military expression , told TPMmuckraker . 
Lebowitz said one key question is whether the activity is judged to be `` partisan . '' 
Though the Tea Party movement has formed political parties in a few states , and has endorsed and supported candidates in some races , there 's no evidence that Stein 's group has done so . 
WASHINGTON -LRB- CBS\/AP -RRB- Political pundits knew health care reform was going to upset critics and the `` tea party '' contingent , but PUNDITS probably did n't expect things to get violent . 
The Democratic leadership in Congress is decrying recent `` acts of violence '' against 10 House Democrats and one Republican , including one report of a cut gas line at the house of the brother of one member of Congress . 
House Republican Leader John Boehner , R-Ohio , says BOEHNER knows that people are angry but denounced the disturbing trend , saying , `` Threats and violence should not be part of a political debate . '' 
Former governor of Alaska Sarah Palin criticized the media for casting CBS\/AP and tea party activists as violent .

There 's no contradiction is saying you would n't vote for someone -LRB- if you 're completely against them -RRB- and also state that you 'll wait for an entire Presidency to transpire before giving an accurate synopsis .

NOW 's a LOT WORSE NOW !!! 
16 . 
.6 % http:\/\/biggovernment.com\/ldoan\/2010\/...-obama-policieThe Obama Administration is putting the best face on the Bureau of Labor Statistics -LRB- BLS -RRB- recent March 2010 jobless numbers report , touting the steady nationwide jobless number of 9.7 % . 
But for minorities , the news is bad and getting worse . 
Great Depression Unemployment Line . 
JPGThe really bad news is buried in the middle of the 38 page report . 
The BLS data reveals an alarming and growing divergence between the number of white and the number of minorities that are unemployed . 
Worse yet , it is clear that minorities , especially African Americans , are falling further behind . 
If unchecked , the long term implications of that imbalance are nightmarish for the nation . 
Larry Summers and others in the Administration have not yet shown much interest in the appalling unemployment rates for minorities and , instead , exude childlike enthusiasm at the nation s overall jobless rate that held steady for the 2nd consecutive month . 
While the unemployment for white Americans averaged 9.3 % , African Americans averaged 16.6 % , just a little less than double the rate of white unemployment . 
Hispanic Americans reported 13.3 % unemployment , while recent , young veterans are averaging 14.7 % . 
Black men , over 20 years old , are showing 20.2 % unemployment and teenaged , African Americans , ages 16-19 , of both sexes , show a mind-boggling 39.3 % unemployed . 
Hispanic teens also report a staggering 30.3 % unemployment . 
The long-term repercussions of these unemployment numbers are troubling , yet the Administration is curiously silent . 
CURRENTPOSTID 81

Interesting . 
Are there any articles on this event because I do n't recall it . 
I do know that , when given the choice between HRC and Obama , Obama 's campaign began to quickly pick up the minority votes as CHOICE became more viable . 
IIRC , earlier in the year , IIRC was almost a given that HRC would gain the nomination . 
Obama was an interesting candidate , but not many think OBAMA could take HRC in the primary . 
HRC was only as the primary approached that PRIMARY appeared OBAMA could win PRIMARY . 
As a member of the GOP , I was rooting for Sen. Thompson for several reasons ... one of which was seeing Mrs. Thompson in the White House for four years .

Thanks for the link , but I still do n't get your point : 
CURRENTPOSTID 122
Point is simple , Devil said back at my original chart that many white voters wont vote for Obama because of color . 
That 's real hypocritical when you see the way the blacks have voted . 
BLACKS give DEVIL a 95 % approval rating when DEVIL has not done a thing for BLACKS , BLACKS have double digit unemployment and NONE of BLACKS have a problem with that ? 
Then to further look at BLACKS voting record look how BLACKS voted against Clinton , a person that HAS helped BLACKS for how many years ? 
BLACKS vote is obviously racist , the numbers are right there . 
A 16 % percent grab of BLACKS vote is an absurdity . 
Just like 95 % approval is .

In CLINTON 1st year in office , our beloved `` Spender-N-Chief '' Obama increased the deficit , spent 3.5 trillion dollars and added over 1.5 + trillion dollars to The National Debt , a new record . 
Come 2012 , Obama will have added over 5 + trillion dollars to The National Debt in just 4 short years . 
False . 
Isreal 's support for President Obama continues to decline . 
President Obama dropped bombs in Pakistan , Afghanistan and Yemen murdering precious life 's innocent blood . 
Furthermore , `` the war of necessity '' -LRB- Afghanistan `` conflict '' -RRB- that President Obama once labeled proceeds on with marginal protests by the Left Wing `` moonbats '' One nation under a bufoon of a President Obama , about as sharp as a bowling ball ...

Hello !

No speculation . 
Most conservatives on this forum adored Bush , warts and all , and would never have criticized anything BUSH did . 
Is that according to the Republican 's rewriting of History ? 
Bill Clinton reversed Reagan 's course , raising taxes on the wealthy , and lowering WEALTHY for the working and middle classes . 
This produced the longest sustained economic expansion in American history . 
Importantly , THIS also produced budgetary surpluses allowing the government to begin paying down the crippling debt begun under Reagan . 
In 2000 , Clinton 's last year , the surplus amounted to $ 236 billion . 
The forecast ten year surplus stood at $ 5.6 trillion . 
It was the last black ink America would see for decades , perhaps forever . 
George W. Bush immediately reversed Clinton 's policy in order to revive Reagan 's , once again showering an embarrassment of riches on the already most embarrassingly rich , BUSH `` base '' as BUSH calls them . 
BUSH ladled out some $ 630 billion in tax cuts to the top 1 % of income earners . 
In true Republican fashion , EARNERS returned the favor by investing over $ 200 million to ensure Bush 's re-election . 
Do the math . 
A $ 630 billion return on a $ 200 million investment : $ 3,160 for $ 1 . 
I 'll give you $ 3,160 . 
All I ask is that you give I $ 1 back so I can keep the goodness flowing . 
Do we have a deal ? 
Republicans know return on investment . 
What you forget to mention is that doing nothing would have put WE in a depression . 
Obama had to do major surgery to repair the damage caused by Bush . 
WE owe all WE thanks to Bush ! 
Israel is not the world , but still , that is just conservative rhetoric . 
Obama supports Israel . 
Apr 9 , 2010Do you approve or disapprove of the Obama administration 's handling of U.S.-Israel relations ? 
A new , annual survey of American Jewish public opinion by the American Jewish Committee finds that Jews , by and large , continue to approve of Obama 57 percent say they approve of the job OBAMA 's doing and also back OBAMA handling of Israel . 
http:\/\/www.politico.com\/blogs\/bensmi...on_Israel.html Well , it is apparent that Republicans do not like Obama , but to take WELL to the level of lying about OBAMA presidency is totally wild . 
The only buffoon we 've had was Bush and thank God BUSH is history -LRB- bad history at that -RRB- .

If Obama has let banks fail , and not pushed a stimulus of the size OBAMA did , we would currently be facing similar situations as took place in the 1920 's and 1930 's , runs on banks , 25-30 % unemployment , a return of the Hoovervilles . 
Obama , if for no other reason will be favorably looked upon 50-100 years from now as the one who had the courage to take a risk , and invest in America , instead of pulling everything in , and letting COURAGE all die . 
Do you really know what a VAT is ? 
Most people who are calling for a flat tax , or a major change to taxation are in favor of methods similar to a VAT , because unlike the Income tax , with all of it 's loopholes , a Value Added Tax , or consumption tax . 
TAX 's much more fair than the BS WE deal with now , and means more people pay a fair tax burden . 
TAX 's also easier to track than trying to keep a history on every american 's income , since TAX 's collected at the business level at the time of sale . 
You only have to track the businesses , so it essentially means the end of the IRS as WE know END . 
I 'd love to see a major reduction in the IRS I , is n't that smaller government ? 
This I have n't looked at a great deal , but Bush did n't exactly spend alot of time trying to secure WE borders either ... in fact as I recall Bush wanted to give em amnesty ... so at worst WE 're no worse off than before . 
Cap and Trade is a good idea , and if CAP gets WE as a country off of Oil , and using renewable energy , we as a country will be way ahead of the rest of the world , and be able to laugh when the oil runs out . 
Because some day , DAY certainly will , and I for one would rather have a renewable form of energy ready sooner rather than later . 
CURRENTPOSTID 165
-RRB- -RRB- -RRB- Well , we do have a $ trillion dollars worth of wars to contend with every year -LRB- WE should count the wars as off-budget items like Bush did -RRB- .

Not to mention the huge hole in the budget Bush left behind by BUSH tax cuts , which , last I heard , has cost the Treasury $ 2.6 trillion dollars . 
And the bank failures . 
And the export of most of our major tax revenue-producing industries .

HE has increased spending\/size of government to record levels , and saved us from another great depression . 
He has \/ will increase US deficit to record levels , and saved US from another great depression . 
HE pushes through legislation HE promised to do and was voted in for . 
HE has strengthened America 's position in the international community , and reversed a new cold war . 
HE has several proposed policies that will help Americans and US economy . 
HE is welcomed by US allies and isolating US enemies . 
HE is continuously lied about by the conservative media .

The stimulus was a failure and full of earmarks . 
Invest in creating a record deficit , with little to show for DEFICIT . 
The problem is that the VAT , if implemented , would be an additional tax , and not replace anything .

The fact remains that Obama has gone backward on enforcement .

How does the government go about spending MORE tax money while providing MORE tax cuts ? 
Fact : Obama 's 1st term increased the national debt 4x more than Bush 's worst term . 
Not to let bush off the line , but did someone forget ? 
They are using tax money to pay back the barrowed money + Interest ? 
The point is , providing tax cuts while spending more is just another way to try to trick the economy into getting better .

I am so tired of hearing about these tax cuts that the Obama has blessed us all with . 
Yet never seeing a liberal anywhere who can point to the precise tax code , precise item , or precise individual to which said `` cuts '' apply . 
So by all means , if such `` cuts '' do exist , show US where . 
Post some links . 
Show US all where and what precisely these so called tax cuts were ? 
Which tax codes did these `` cuts '' address . 
Who did THESE cut taxation for ? 
What goods did THESE cut taxation on ? 
By what percent did THESE lower the rate of taxation ? 
Simply declaring that Obama 's so called stimulus cut taxation , does not make TAXATION so . 
Just as simply declaring that Obama 's so called stimulus turned the economy around and brought us out of recession did n't make STIMULUS so either . 
You see liberals , LIBERALS al know for a fact that the so called stimulus bill , increased taxation on the poorest Americans . 
Because AL increased taxation on tobacco and alcohol . 
And well , well , well , guess who just happens to drink and smoke the most in this nation . 
You got GUESS , the poorest Americans . 
So where are these `` cuts '' at Ireimon . 
Oh and if you happen to be referring to the `` cuts '' he and HE demophony cronies in Congress plan to make to Medicaid and Medicare . 
Those are not tax cuts , those are robbing the poorest Americans , to give to the richest , and are not in the so called `` stimulus '' either but rather were in the liberals healthcare dictate otherwise known as tyrantcare .

Now now in all fairness there has been job growth . 
The problem is however , that for every job created , two others went away . 
This administration , and ADMINISTRATION 's liberal supporters however always want to point to the job growth in this or that economic sector , as for example SUPPORTERS do inm pointing to the creation of Government jobs , due to the workers ADMINISTRATION 's hired for the census . 
Yet do so , all the while ignoring the fact that in other sectors of the economy there was a net loss in jobs , and those jobs which YET created , are not permanent jobs but rather are temporary and YET will go away later this year too .

USE does not get much more hypocritical than that ladies and gents , than for the liberals to lecture everyone about `` tone '' and `` respectful discourse '' all the while labeling LADIES political opposition with such deragatory terms as `` tea bagger '' and slandering the movement with false , unsubstantiated , unspported by fact , assertions of violence . 
Especially given that time and time again , in incident after incident , TIME 's been the leftists who become\/became violent while protesting . 
Infact , during the entire term of former President Bush , these same liberals who are now so worried about violence , defended such things as assault and violence comitted by fellow liberals , in incidents such as throwing pies , vandalism to private property saying such actions comitted by these leftists , in LIBERALS name , for LIBERALS `` cause '' was defended as `` free speech '' and `` patriotism '' . 
And that 's not even taking into account , LIBERALS attempted defense of the recent attack on persons leaving a republican fundraiser , by attempting to outright lie concerning the facts of the case . 
Claiming first that it was not liberals who were there protesting which comitted the attack , and then falsely claiming that the attack was not politically motivated , eventhough the New Orleans police Department say 's ATTACK was . 
See once again , we are all supposed to ignore the fact that FACT 's by far , more often than not , these leftists who become violent in the face of opposition to LEFTISTS ideology . 
So the liberals can pretend that VICTIMS 're just the poor misunderstood victims .

At that point cuts will have to happen . 
Bush got into Iraq which has cost a ton of money .

When an audience member fretted about going to prison for not buying health insurance , Coburn responded , `` The intention is not to put anyone in jail . 
That makes for good TV on Fox , but that is n't the intention . ''

Albeit a VERY subjective argument , I 'm almost afraid to ask ... How did you come to that conclusion ? 
-LRB- Please do n't just repeat the talking points of your ` politician du jour ' -RRB- 
CURRENTPOSTID 268
For starters their governmental experience . 
Governor of a state , any state requires one to learn the necessary skills to deal with a far greater scope of issues , and do so in the executive role . 
BELIEVER do not feel Senators make good candidates nor good presidents . 
It was a great disappointment to BELIEVER to see McCain and Obama as the candidates . 
BELIEVER am a very strong believer that executive experience is essential to good presidential candidates -LRB- and no Mayor does n't qualify , BELIEVER dispised the concept of Guilani even running -RRB- . 
BELIEVER personally feel that assessment is dead on with Obama , likewise BELIEVER think McCain would have been a weak president . 
Secondly after Bush , Congress was going to grab CANDIDATES balls back , which CANDIDATES promptly did . 
This merely indicated that whoever the president would be would not enjoy the precieved executive powers Bush had . 
For years CANDIDATES seemed to forget who CANDIDATES were and acted as the executive 's ATM machine , both sides contributed to that , both are accountable . 
Couple that with a president without executive experience and you simply creating an even weaker executive . 
An experienced executive , even from a small state , would better know how to deal with the legistature as a separate entity . 
An experienced executive would also not allow CREATING to be steamrolled by Congress , which it appears has happened to Obama since day one . 
CONGRESS does n't help that the Congressional majority is EXECUTIVE own party , EXECUTIVE only has so much room to put EXECUTIVE foot down before EXECUTIVE causes in-fighting . 
Therefore BELIEVER conclusion is that Palin was indeed , after careful adjustment 9.4 times more qualified to be president than Obama .

Iriemon is right ! 
People that post here are actually paying attention to politics so unless PEOPLE believe in socialism , welfare , racist programs like Affirmative Action , taking no responsibility for your own actions , or redistribution of wealth PEOPLE wont be voting for Obombya . 
The best thing the conservatives can do to rid CONSERVATIVES of this moron is to educate the masses . 
For example 2 of my best friends and staunch conservatives are always dismayed by FRIENDS parents votes , FRIENDS always vote Democratic because that s the way FRIENDS always voted and FRIENDS just don t pay attention any more . 
FRIENDS both attribute FRIENDS beliefs and ideologies to FRIENDS parents so at heart FRIENDS parents are even more conservative then FRIENDS are and have taught FRIENDS well , FRIENDS just ca n't get FRIENDS parents to realize that the Dems have been hijacked by the loony tune left . 
Like the fact that the overwhelming majority of Jewish families vote Democratic .

Quite a bit better than the last several presidents that were promoted by liberals . 
Obama is taking financial irresponsibility to new heights , which does n't seem to concern liberals that cried crocodile tears over Bush spending , even though Obama spends magnitudes more ... Clinton spent most of CLINTON years neutered by a Republican congress , and even so , CLINTON managed to pass a massive tax increase in CLINTON first couple years , after promissing cuts .

You must have been looking at an old Faux News poll . 
Actually , he is doing much better than conservatives give HE credit for , in spite of the economic mess Bush left the country in when BUSH left office . 
President Obama s job approval rating improved this week and now stands at 46 percent , up from a record low of 43 percent approval in early April . 
An equal number of voters disapprove of the job President Obama is doing -LRB- 46 percent -RRB- . 
And , this is from Faux News , now take a look at a true poll . 
CNN Poll : Obama approval ratings up Passage of the landmark health care bill appears to have boosted President Barack Obama 's approval rating , but POLL has not affected OBAMA re-election chances so far , according to a new national poll . 
A CNN\/Opinion Research Corporation survey released Monday indicates that 51 percent of Americans approve of the job Obama is doing in the White House , with 48 percent saying they disapprove . 
That 51 percent approval rating is up five points from a week ago , before Congress approved the health care reform bill and the president signed the legislation into law . 
Four in ten respondents say RESPONDENTS disapprove because Obama is too liberal and 6 percent say RESPONDENTS the president is not liberal enough .

The fact that I do n't think he 's doing a bad job ?

Ridiculous ? 
Okay .

How long do those nominees last ? 
I think people are ridiculous for not considering SCOTUS nominations as an important motivation behind voting .

So in effect when one stays home their unvote went for the candidate that wins . 
In your case you helped elect Obama . 
If you like what OBAMA 's doing then that 's fine for you , if you do n't -LRB- and apparently you do n't by your above comment -RRB- then you 're part of the problem . 
I 'm speaking in general about non-voters . 
Each vote is important , many have fought and died for our privilege -LRB- not right -RRB- to vote and every election has consequences as has been and continues to be seen . 
I too hope that true statesmen would run for office not the sycophants that OUR 've had to settle for these past many , many years . 
I suppose the problem is that there 's so few of the earlier and too many of the latter . 
OUR would even recognize a real statemen in this time and day ? 
Though I ca n't think of any statesmen at this time , perhaps someone might offer a name or two of such . 
CURRENTPOSTID 325
Portray it anyway you want to , I could no more stomach the idea of consenting to a McCain presidency than I could to Obama 's . 
I made IT very clear to I fellow Republicans before we even got close to the primaries that I would never support OBAMA , and would refuse to vote if they chose to nominate OBAMA . 
I would rather see a real liberal Democrat remind Americans of how bad THEY are , than put another RINO in the White House and have the majority of Americans continue to blame WE for what are basically liberal policies . 
The differences between Obama and McCain were so minimal to I as to not be worthy of a choice . 
CURRENTPOSTID 326
Oh yeah , Obama is a world peace-maker and problem-solver ! 
LOL !!! 
CURRENTPOSTID 327
You are correct . 
Obama got into office with everything but OBAMA credentials , which are non-existent .

I 've long been on record as refusing to vote rather than to vote for McCain , but that does n't mean I do n't think that Obama is worse than McCain would have been . 
Just various degrees of liberal bad .

Was n't even close , IMO . 
McCain would have been an absolute disaster . 
CURRENTPOSTID 333
Unsupported partisan rhetoric really annoys me . 
Is this implying that he should have been able to ? 
ME seriously doubt that the majority of Americans would have supported a single-payer health care package . 
Is n't the HCR package bad enough ? 
ME actually see this as a positive and not a negative . 
ME do n't want many of his campaign promises fulfilled . 
Not completely but certainly a major improvement over the prior adminstration . 
ME do n't think is has a choice on this . 
HIS inherited a government that required tax increases because of the deficits which CHOICE created . 
Congress has not helped that problem by creating a new trillion entitlement program with the HCR bill . 
BTW better to raise taxes than to continue with the deficits . 
As has every president in history . 
He had a good teacher in the prior adminstration . 
This is actually Congress which ignores the People . 
The president can only sign or veto legislation . 
This is false . 
As have all presidents . 
False again . 
Of note some who are considered as `` Allies '' should n't be . 
While selective in his statements , often pulling information from context , this is a common practice for all politicians . 
HIS has not blatantly lied anymore than other prior adminstrations . 
Did n't vote for Obama or McCain on 2008 because ADMINSTRATIONS were both losers . 
ME wo n't vote for Obama in 2012 and seriously doubt that ME will vote for the Republican candidate . 
CURRENTPOSTID 334
Maybe for Republicans politically . 
That 's about the best case you could make there . 
Both of them would have been bad for the country ... But Obama is far , FAR worse than McCain would have been , and that 's saying a lot . 
Then again , when someone takes a dump in your Cheerios , most people are n't going to get a baggie and weigh the size of BAGGIE . 
PEOPLE both sucked .

McCain\/Palin , though McCain would have been a rhino which would have meant keeping the status quo which IMHO would have been preferable to what we have now . 
Of course WE conservatives would have preferred a candidate more in the line of Ronald Reagan but I do n't see any on the horizon at this time though Sarah Palin comes the closest and I would vote for a woman as well as any other minority , ` cept Obama . 
As both sides say `` every election has consequences '' . 
And WE now are paying for the consequences of an Obomba administration . 
How well does this work you those who did n't vote ? 
CURRENTPOSTID 339
If CHOICE was a choice between a Republican liberal and a Democrat liberal , I prefer to let the Democrats take the blame for their liberal .

The Republicans had Ron Paul who they could have selected to be THEY candidate in 2008 but instead selected an antique who 's political positions were reflective of the Cold War mentality of the 1960 's . 
When the Republicans select a presidential candidate who is willing to withdraw the US military from foreign bases and follow the US Constitution which specifically establishes that the federal government is limited to providing `` for the common Defense ... of the United States '' then STATES might pay attention . 
As long as the Republican Party supports wars of US imperialism around the world PARTY will not have STATES support , ever . 
CURRENTPOSTID 342
The lesser of two evils , McCain . 
CURRENTPOSTID 343
Do n't blame me . 
ME actively opposed the McCain nomination , and did everything ME could to convince other Republicans how awful he would be . 
Then again , your definition of `` imperialism '' is quite out of whack . 
If the U.S. was truly imperialistic , we would outright own half of Europe , and almost all of the Middle East by now . 
CURRENTPOSTID 344
You 'll get over THING . 
You 're right . 
THING is a good thing that he has n't made good on most of HE promises . 
HE should be very disappointing to HE supporters . 
Have you ever heard of cutting spending , reducing waste ? 
Obama takes the cake on this , and OBAMA has a few years left to solidify OBAMA top spot . 
Which also ignores the wishes of The People . 
OBAMA administration has stripped several provisions from the prior Administration which helped control the illegal population . 
Luckily , states like Arizona are taking things into PEOPLE own hands , like PEOPLE should . 
Once again , Obama takes the booby prize . 
Come on . 
OBAMA kisses ass . 
OBAMA bows to everyone . 
OBAMA apologizes for `` evil '' America . 
Especially to the Muslims . 
How can you say this when you do n't who the Republican candidate is ? 
CURRENTPOSTID 345
Even my parents , life-long Republicans , found PARENTS were unable to support McCain and PARENTS live in Arizona only a few miles from one of McCain 's homes . 
MY often use the term `` imperialism '' to reflect attempts by the US to impose political and economic control over the government of sovereign states and not in the more common definition of literally controlling territory . 
If a nation controls the government of a sovereign state NATION effectively controls the territory of that state . 
CURRENTPOSTID 346
Carter was n't the worst president in US history . 
` Expert ' surveys usually put CARTER at the middle of the pack . 
Surveys of the general voting public put CARTER at between 11 and 13th best , usually . 
The only people who call CARTER the ` worst ' president are partisan hacks on the right . 
A -RRB- CARTER 's done a better job of that than most presidents in the last 30 years . 
B -RRB- If your claim had been true , would n't that have run counter to your point about CARTER ` ramming through legislation CARTER wants ' against the will of the people ? 
You ca n't have CLAIM both ways . 
Either CARTER imposes CARTER own preferences over the will of the people , or CARTER graciously sets aside CARTER personal policy preferences when the will of the people becomes clear and does not achieve CARTER campaign promises as a result . 
-LRB- quote -RRB- CARTER has not been transparent . 
-LRB- quote -RRB- More than any other 21st century president has been . 
CARTER has not done so yet , and US 'm not going to let that impact US decision until CARTER does or until CARTER makes serious noises about doing IMPACT . 
Aside from that , US think we desperately need to balance the budget , and the way to do that is to increase taxes . 
If that means raising taxes for everyone , so be BUDGET . 
Every president has done that since ... Carter . 
Clinton did more to reduce the scope of government than Reagan or either Bush ever did . 
Every president in the last 30 years has presided over record government deficits ... except Clinton . 
US have no reason to believe the Fake Conservatives will do any different . 
CONSERVATIVES 've demonstrated CONSERVATIVES willingness to push through unpopular legislation many times in the past . 
CONSERVATIVES 're certainly proposing an effort to push through a lot of legislation US do n't like , often against the will of the people . 
No , NO has n't . 
Bush II and Reagan both did way more to weaken American national security than Obama has done . 
Overspending on your military while engaging in two wars at the same time is not the path to national security . 
Earning more enemies than allies is not the path to national security . 
Antagonizing enemies whom you were not actually at war with is not the path to national security . 
Complete speculation . 
PATH 's ` shunning ' ENEMIES to insist ENEMIES listen to reason ? 
If spewing lies to the American people were a good reason not to vote for someone , we 'd never elect any president . 
REASON will depends on who the Republicans put forward for a candidate . 
If PEOPLE nominate Sarah Palin or another Fake Conservative , then US probably would vote for Obama again . 
None of the Republican candidates currently being floated by the media seem like CANDIDATES 're at all worth voting for . 
CURRENTPOSTID 347
Several bills have been analyzed on factcheck.com . 
In addition to the one that passed , there were two bipartisan bills that never gained traction in congress , both preceding the president 's bill -LRB- formed during that long , unproductive period of time that Obama left congress to make up a bill on their own -RRB- . 
Both were pretty similar to Obama 's aside from a few details . 
Then there was Boehner 's bill , which is the one considered a `` Republican bill . '' 
And , yes , ONE was a joke . 
ONE 's method of `` expanding coverage '' was permanent state-administered high-risk pools . 
Completely unsustainable . 
The rest of ONE was based on deregulation that at best would have driven costs down slightly for people with non-employer-based coverage , but likely also would have decreased the quality of service and instituted a race for the bottom as states compete for insurance company business by adopting the loosest possible regulations .

CURRENTPOSTID 392
You tell us ! 
First , Mr. Bush never was a strong student . 
BUSH transcript at Yale , leaked to The New Yorker , shows that BUSH was a solid C student . 
Although a history major , BUSH sampled widely in the social sciences and did poorly in political science and economics while achieving some of BUSH best grades -LRB- the equivalent of a B + -RRB- in philosophy and anthropology . 
-LRB- The anthropology class , however , was taught by Margaret Mead that year and was enormously popular because + offered among the easiest grades at Yale . -RRB- 
Mr. Bush was not much of a student of politics , for BUSH earned only a 73 in Introduction to the American Political System and a 71 in Introduction to International Relations . 
Few , if any , professors seem to have left a mark on BUSH , or BUSH on PROFESSORS . 
Several professors who taught BUSH said BUSH had simply been one student in a huge class . 
As the historian John Morton Blum put ONE , `` BLUM have n't the foggiest recollection of BUSH . '' 
Erich Segal , who later met Mr. Gore at Harvard and based the main character in `` Love Story '' partly on GORE , taught a classical comedy course that Mr. Bush took , but Mr. Segal said SEGAL had no memory of SEGAL . 
The transcript indicates that in Mr. Bush 's freshman year , the only year for which rankings were available , BUSH was in the 21st percentile of BUSH class , meaning that four-fifths of the students had better grades than BUSH did .

Actually , I have to disagree with you on this one . 
I 've heard some liberals upset with Obama for not being liberal enough .

But logic was never much MANY strong suit ...

Why ? 
CURRENTPOSTID 400
He ordered all federal agencies to find spending cuts and promote transparency , HE reduced the secrecy in executive records , HE restored full adherence to the Freedom of Information Act , HE increased press conferences and town halls , HE blocked lobbyists from accessing the White House or hiring HOUSE staffers , and HE limited White House salaries , saved or created a million direct or indirect jobs with the stimulus program , HE saved the auto industry , the financial industry and the housing market , HE got banks to pay back big buckets of bailout money , HE got the markets up 50 percent in a matter of months , HE turned the corner on monthly unemployment rates , HE stopped the slide in GDP , and HE trimmed the budget deficit by 200 billion a year , gave food and support and health coverage to the unemployed , HE helped people to save PEOPLE mortgages , HE expanded student loans and loan refinancing , HE expanded loans to small businesses , HE established the homeowners credit , and regardless of all the lies spewed by HE enemies , HE cut our taxes . 
Along the way HE fixed up neglected roads , bridges and power plants , and funded school construction and internet access , helped round up the crooks who got OUR into all this economic trouble . 
HE ended tax breaks for firms that outsource OUR jobs ; HE prevented tax cheats from hiding CROOKS money overseas and finally persuaded Swiss bankers to expose crooked depositors ; HE reformed the credit card industry , HE ended protection of predatory credit card firms , and HE signed the anti-fraud bill , won a Nobel Prize for getting the world back on track , on arms proliferation , the Middle East peace process , relations with the Muslim world , climate change , war crimes , torture , and diplomacy . 
HE reengaged with world leaders and the international community , HE improved America s image internationally , HE repaired bilateral relations with dozens of countries , HE persuaded Pakistan to go after the Taliban , HE improved OUR Cuba policy , and HE freed prisoners in North Korea and Myanmar ; showed HE balls by putting more troops in Afghanistan and improving Afghanistan policy ; HE killed the Somali pirates , freed the American captain , and put the Navy in Somali waters ; pulled troops out of Iraq and stopped the stop-loss system , HE got body armor for OUR troops , HE increased pay , benefits , medical care and housing for troops and veterans , HE hired more military spouses ; HE improved conditions at military hospitals , HE stopped the media blackout on war casualties and on the arrival of the coffins at Dover AFB , and HE paid to bring families of soldiers to Dover when the coffins arrived ; stopped the torture , and HE directed the closure of Guantanamo and the secret prisons in Europe ; cleaned up HE predecessor s blank-check defense spending : HE overhauled military procurement , HE blocked no-bid defense contracts , and HE phased out unnecessary military programs like the F22 and missile defense ; expanded health care for 4 million children , expanded vaccination programs , cut drug costs for seniors , saved hundreds of millions by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices , led the fight against the swine flu , and stopped pharmacists from cutting women off from birth control .

Well , if you 're referring to Obama and 2012 , OBAMA is no shoo-in by any stretch of the imagination . 
You should remember in 2008 the man had no record to run on , people had this unrealistic belief in MAN , MAN may have been destined to be the first black President . 
But now the truth about MAN has come out , MAN has a record , MAN radical agenda has been exposed and white guilt is no longer a reason to vote for MAN . 
More and more Americans are recognizing how bad MAN is for us to continue to live the American dream , to have the freedoms US took for granted and the proper role of the Federal Government . 
`` If the economy is improving or humming along ? '' 
And just what has or is MAN doing to make that a reality ? 
Apparently you 're still employed , have n't lost your home -LRB- or perhaps sucking at the teat of the government -RRB- otherwise you 're in la-la land . 
`` The unemployement rate is decreasing or low ? '' 
Have we come to a point that WE accept a near 10 % unemployment rate as the new norm ? 
How anyone can still believe in this unman is beyond my human understanding . 
UNMAN 's kind of like trying to grasp the size of the universe , the mind can not take UNMAN in . 
But reality will sink in , so there is hope for you and the others of your ilk .

The only reason we 're stuck is because WE continue to vote the same buffoons into office .

Once WE get past that mindset , then perhaps REPRESENTATIVES 'll get ONCE and start representing the people . 
There is a chance for a third party or two , but CHANCE has to start at the local level and grow into a regional , then perhaps national level . 
The failure is that FAILURE 's backward . 
Other parties try to start at the top , this does n't work and even if TOP might that party would be a minority among a minority in congress and have little sway . 
Countries where this exists now you 'll notice that PARTIES have to form coalitions to win and run the country . 
This is both good and bad as these coalitions tend to fall apart and the country undergoes change without any hope of stability .

Seriously you live in another universe . 
No one is against reducing spending . 
PEOPLE simply ca n't agree on what to cut . 
Democrats would like to see defense budgets cut and republicans would like to see social programs cut . 
Both have a lot of waste in BOTH but the fact is we are paying for BOTH NOW and WE can spend the next thousand years debating what needs to be cut or WE can actually pay for what WE are spending now and sort NOW out quicker when people get pissed at how high PEOPLE taxes are . 
CURRENTPOSTID 423
lmao SENATOR 's been a US senator since the 70s . 
What the hell are you talking about ?! 
CURRENTPOSTID 424
You of the parallel universe , thinking that Democrats want to reduce spending . 
You 've made YOU day ... YOU say cut all federal spending except that which is necessary to to the health and security of this nation . 
And YOU do n't mean Health insurance . 
CURRENTPOSTID 425
You think being a Senator is a job ? 
What the hell are you thinking ? 
CURRENTPOSTID 426
And what is unnecessary . 
There have been polls on this . 
Of all the big spending items not one thing can gain over 20 &#37; approval for cutting . 
Meanwhile our deficit is getting higher and higher . 
OUR need to pay the bill now . 
Not wait until OUR bill gets smaller . 
CURRENTPOSTID 427
There is just no talking to people like you ... 
CURRENTPOSTID 428
Is there anyone on this planet who does n't want to save money ? 
That 's just a ridiculous notion that you think there are people that do n't want to save money . 
CURRENTPOSTID 429
They are paying the bill now , ever hear of taxes and the government printing money . 
Your response is kind of like the one about illegal immigration . 
I 'll paraphase : Meanwhile the number of illegals is getting higher and higher . 
We need to stop the flow of illegal immigrants now . 
Not wait until those numbers get higher . 
See what I mean ? 
CURRENTPOSTID 430
You 're correct . 
People who 've had a job know what I mean . 
And you do n't think those Senators know SENATORS have a cushy position , terrific benefits , health insurance you 'll never have , a pension beyond description , all expenses paid , and on an on . 
I know you 're struggling to make sense of all this but to tell you the truth , the only thing left in I wallet now is cents , not sense . 
CURRENTPOSTID 431
Again you are assuming democrats do not support securing the border . 
We do . 
WE just do n't support kicking people who have already established a life and family here out . 
CURRENTPOSTID 432
US guarantee you 've never had a job that held as much responsibility as a US senator . 
CURRENTPOSTID 433
Wanting to save and actually saving are two different things . 
Guess how many families can save now ? 
How many even have a job , a home , a hope ? 
No , times have changed . 
The unending pool of money that the government use to have -LRB- our money mind you -RRB- is no longer . 
POOL 's credit all OUR have yet the government still continues to spend , spend , spend OUR into oblivion . 
Now if you have access to a gravy train , please share NOW with OUR . 
CURRENTPOSTID 434
I agree . 
But we are talking about wants . 
Not dos . 
Both republicans and democrats have wants for what to cut . 
But both fail to make the cuts . 
The republicans consistently fail to make cuts to . 
Anyone and everyone will consistently fail to make cuts for as long as we are unwilling to make the sacrifice for what WE are already spending and raise taxes to cover SACRIFICE . 
As long as Americans can still go shopping at the mall REPUBLICANS do n't really care about cutting spending . 
Like ANYONE sad ... there is n't a single big ticket item that the American people broadly support cutting . 
Nothing gains over 20 &#37; support for cutting . 
If we raised taxes and put a fire under American butts you can be sure WE will pick something to cut and fast . 
CURRENTPOSTID 435
No , I do n't think Democrats want to secure the border , NO want those new potential Democrat voters . 
So we should just willy-nilly let anyone cross over to establish a life and family here without regard to whether LIFE 's legal or not . 
NO knew if beforehand that CROSS was wrong , but NO came anyway . 
Kind of like a criminal knowing what NO are doing is wrong but not expecting to get caught and suffer the consequence . 
Perhaps you want to spend your hard earned -LRB- or is that hardly earned -RRB- money on NO , but I do n't . 
I preference to to help those American citizens and legal immigrants who have a need . 
You 're all emotional , suggesting we want to kick people out . 
No , WE want NO to follow the laws of this land as you -LRB- I think -RRB- and I do . 
So stop with the crybaby tactic and be a man that wants to ensure the health and security of this nation . 
No different than what any country would want and expect . 
CURRENTPOSTID 436
They are raising taxes as we write and the fire THEY are putting under American butts is what is stemming the tide of continued wasteful spending . 
No longer is spending the catch phrase , PHRASE 's holding the line . 
You want your taxes raises , go for PHRASE . 
As for me ME want the spending cut and cut NOW ! 
Our representatives are starting to get the message and you see how many of REPRESENTATIVES are leaving congress and losing primaries . 
Yep , as YEP should be . 
You raise taxes , you increase spending , YEP 's as simple as that . 
CURRENTPOSTID 437
That 's gotta be the most backward ass conspiracy theroy THAT 've ever heard lol . 
How the hell are illegal immigrants going to vote ? 
IMMIGRANTS ca n't even become naturalized citizens if IMMIGRANTS are illegal . 
And what about the American citizen children of illegal immigrants ? 
Are we supposed to rip CHILDREN parents away from PARENTS ? 
THAT fail to see how THAT 'm being emotional . 
You 're the one calling THAT a cry baby lol . 
The fact is yes PARENTS broke the law but PARENTS 're here . 
And many of PARENTS have been here for decades . 
MANY 've established a life here and LIFE 's completely inhumane to relocate MANY to a place MANY are no longer familiar with . 
Especially if MANY have children who are American citizens . 
THAT mean hey if MANY 've been here for a year or two then yeah , deport MANY . 
But if MANY 've been here for many years or MANY have children here then what 's the point . 
Clearly MANY are n't hurting anyone by being here . 
CURRENTPOSTID 438
I want to cut spending too . 
But I 'm telling you it 's not going to happen . 
You can say you want to all you want but IT 's not going to happen . 
No one cuts spending when they are living a comfortable life . 
People only cut spending when PEOPLE are forced to . 
This is why Obama 's pay-go law is such a good law . 
If we pass a spending bill then there should be revenue that goes with BILL . 
If WE are n't making sacrifices for WE high spending then there is no incentive to cut spending . 
So you can ride your high horse all you want pretending you 're the only one who wants to cut spending . 
When in fact everyone wants to cut spending . 
WE just ca n't agree on what to cut because none of WE are actually sacrificing enough to feel WE need to cut things WE actually want to be able to spend money on . 
Let I ask you this . 
I want to see a cut in defense spending by 50 % . 
Would you support this cut ? 
CURRENTPOSTID 440
You 're repeating yourself . 
You assume we support kicking people out of here . 
Again , PEOPLE knew what PEOPLE did was wrong before PEOPLE did it , sounds like a planned crime to me . 
Suffer the consequences . 
Besides PEOPLE have a home in the land PEOPLE came from . 
How about PEOPLE establishing a life and family in PEOPLE homeland . 
A one for one swap . 
We keep one illegal , the other country will deal with you . 
CURRENTPOSTID 441
Sure I have . 
Life and death for that matter . 
They care more about THEY life and pursuit of happiness than those you assume THEY care about . 
Typical rich representatives that care about the poor . 
Do n't make I laugh . 
CURRENTPOSTID 442
Duh ! 
Democrats want to legalize the illegal immigrant , this is how DEMOCRATS 'll get the vote . 
There are many , many American children living around the world to non-American parents . 
What 's the big deal ? 
The problem is the parents came here illegally , remain here illegally , the children will do just fine with CHILDREN parents elsewhere . 
Ok , I see a little movement on your part . 
How the heck are we suppose to know how long PARENTS lived here , PARENTS 're illegal , no documentation ? 
Obviously many are hurting others here , look at the rise in crime rates in those areas swarming with illegals . 
I suppose you are ok with this since you probably live in a white only neighborhood . 
CURRENTPOSTID 443
Life or death of hundreds of millions of people ? 
CURRENTPOSTID 444
I do n't want the government to force I -LRB- or tell I -RRB- how to spend I money , I certainly do n't want to see taxes rise to help the government spend the money . 
You have GOVERNMENT all backwards . 
No money , no spending . 
How about that ? 
Defense is indeed something the Federal Government should be spending money on . 
DEFENSE 's about keeping this country safe and secure . 
Aside from a few specific domestic issues the government should not be in the business of providing that which amounts to welfare or feel good spending so they can stay in office . 
Go back , read the Constitution and other documents of our Founding Fathers . 
FATHERS would be aghast at how bloated OUR bureaucracy is . 
I sacrifice enough , about time others who have n't start . 
CURRENTPOSTID 445
I just gave you an area to cut spending and you turned AREA down ! 
Why are you against cutting spending ! 
CURRENTPOSTID 446
You referring to Senators ? 
I needed a good laugh . 
Thanks ! 
CURRENTPOSTID 447
You only address part of my response . 
MY did not say MY would n't support defense spending , but 50 % , that 's what our enemies would like . 
MY mentioned where MY think the spending should be . 
But apparently you like to be taxed and do n't care about continued spending . 
Mighty big of you to spend MY money too . 
CURRENTPOSTID 448
Yes . 
Senators make decisions that affect the lives of millions of Americans . 
Bad decisions on congress 's part could lead to complete disasters if done incorrectly . 
SENATORS have more responsibility than you ever did . 
CURRENTPOSTID 449
Cutting our defense by 50 % would mean OUR would be spending more on defense than the next 8 countries combined . 
I think OUR 'll be fine . 
CURRENTPOSTID 450
Yes THEY do . 
It is they that approved the actions in Afghanistan , Iraq and elsewhere . 
More Americans have died as a result of THEY actions so RESULT 's on THEY , not me . 
THEY make bad decisions everyday that are complete disaster , note the new Health Care bill , the rampant spending , the bankruptcy THEY are leading us to -LRB- although ME think US 're already there -RRB- . 
You go Obama -LRB- ex-Senator , soon to be ex-President -RRB- . 
CURRENTPOSTID 451
We 'd also be cutting WE own throats , would n't have to wait for the terrorists to do so . 
WE defense is what keeps WE safe and secure . 
You willing to give that up for the lavish spending on welfare and such ? 
CURRENTPOSTID 452
Cutting defense even by 50 % would not do a whole lot for us , apart from the fact that LOT is one of the few things left in the budget that the federal government is actually constitutionally mandated to provide . 
US entire security spending for FY2010 is $ 844 billion , and only part of that is defense spending . 
CURRENTPOSTID 453
Agree . 
A strong military\/national defense is what maintains our way of life . 
Sure the economy sucks , but ECONOMY sucks everywhere right now . 
CURRENTPOSTID 454
Our biggest enemy right now does n't even have an air force . 
Their idea of a good strategy is strapping a bomb to THEIR chest and walking into a mall . 
IDEA 's absolute paranoia to think spending more than the next 8 top military COMBINED is not enough . 
Absolute paranoia . 
CURRENTPOSTID 455
Defense counts for 19 % of our budget . 
DEFENSE 's the 2nd largest area of spending . 
DEFENSE 's not the end all solution but to pretend DEFENSE would n't have a serious impact on OUR budget is ridiculous . 
CURRENTPOSTID 457
That , plus getting out of Iraq and Afghanistan , would cut expenditures by about $ 450 billion a year . 
That 's a lot , maybe even a whole lot . 
CURRENTPOSTID 458
There wo n't be any other guy -LRB- or gal -RRB- . 
You 've excluded everyone . 
CURRENTPOSTID 459
CBO numbers for 2020 : http:\/\/www.cbo.gov\/Social programs account for 48 % , defense a mere 15 % . 
CURRENTPOSTID 460
Social programs benefit the economy . 
CURRENTPOSTID 461
To an extent , but without a strong defense our security would be compromised and you can forget about social programs for that money will go to things that wo n't benefit the economy or the people . 
Look around the world , see where in totalitarian governments where the money goes . 
Defense , little left for the people . 
So in that light , you can see OUR defense spending is negligible . 
CURRENTPOSTID 462
Are you sure he 's going to run ? 
CURRENTPOSTID 463
Are you saying you do n't think we 'd be secure spending more than the next 8 top militaries combined ? 
Because that 's how much WE 'd be spending if WE cut defense spending in half . 
I mean do WE really need as many bases in Europe as WE have ? 
No one in Europe is WE enemy . 
CURRENTPOSTID 464
Great post , It 's not only Obama that is lacking in the common sense area , another perfect example is that nit wit Holder . 
CURRENTPOSTID 465
Maybe if you were talking about High School . 
But certainly college . 
And certainly not Harvard Law School . 
You have to be a very well rounded person intellectually to get through with a 4.0 . 
CURRENTPOSTID 466
I would say we would not be secure . 
WE are not in Europe and South Korea and elsewhere because ENEMIES are WE enemies . 
WE are there for many purposes . 
Including having WE forces around the world ready for defending WE home country from afar to keep WE enemies away and also for the defense of countries that WE count as allies . 
Personally , I 'd like to see WE armed forces return to America and have a much more powerful Navy and long-range Air Force . 
A strong missle defense -LRB- and offense , if needed -RRB- and much more reliance on satellite techology . 
I 'd like to say DEFENSE 'd be nice to rely on allies who have a powerful military but at this time that is not the case and many of those allies are falling prey to radical Islam and new government structures that will turn against WE , as some have already . 
You are naive if you think letting down WE defense will be a good thing for American and DEFENSE 's people . 
You are falling for the lies of the Left and WE other enemies . 
CURRENTPOSTID 467
I thought `` very well rounded person '' included common sense , experience and good judgment as well as some semblence of strength . 
You do n't obtain these characteristics from college , certainly not Harvard Law School . 
CURRENTPOSTID 468
I did n't say you gain them . 
I said it implies you have THEM . 
You do n't get through Harvard Law School with a 4.0 with no common sense . 
CURRENTPOSTID 469
I said nothing about letting our defense down . 
I want OUR defense more efficient . 
OUR do n't have a single enemy that would fight OUR in Europe . 
Not a one . 
OUR biggest and most capable enemy is North Korea . 
North Korea is not going to fight OUR in Europe . 
And if an enemy in Europe arrises OUR have allies there that would allow OUR to build a base at any time . 
OUR European bases are nothing but WW2 and Cold War relics . 
ALLIES are useless wastes of money . 
CURRENTPOSTID 470
4.0 with no common sense ? 
Have you actually ever met a Harvard School Law School grad ? 
If so , you 'd eat your words . 
Look around , especially at Obama and OBAMA administration . 
No common sense to be found . 
CURRENTPOSTID 471
I did n't say a Harvard Law Grad . 
I said a magna cum laude 4.0 Harvard Law Grad . 
They are the best of the best . 
Anyone who can do that is EXTREMELY well rounded and intelligent . 
CURRENTPOSTID 472
You are n't going to get someone that thinks `` C-student-Bush '' is the most intelligent president we 've ever had , and `` D-in-economics-Palin '' who does n't know squat is Presidential material , to admit that Obama is not only intelliginet and eloquent , but highly qualified to be President and doing a good job at JOB . 
JOB just wo n't happen . 
The Party of `` no '' wo n't allow NO . 
CURRENTPOSTID 473
Nobody is nocking Obama 's education . 
Frankly , I do n't care . 
If the president was a high school dropout but did a good job , who cares ? 
CURRENTPOSTID 475
To be honest we must segregate what is within the authority of the Office of the President and what is not . 
Not within the power of the president . 
Not exclusively within the power of the president . 
Not within the power of the president . 
Within the power of the president . 
Not within the power of the president . 
Within the power of the president . 
Not within the power of the president . 
Not within the power of the president . 
Not within the power of the president . 
It is true that no president or presidential candidate should make promises which they has no authority to keep but Americans should be smart enough to know what the president does and does not have authority to do . 
Listing items which we know the president has no authority reflects either ignorance or partisan politics which is n't concerned with real issues . 
CURRENTPOSTID 476
Not a fact , an opinion . 
By what standards do you make that assumption ? 
The standards of those that have a vested interest in perpetrating such acclaim ? 
The best of the best . 
YOU , how you 've been taken in . 
You actually worship these people ? 
CURRENTPOSTID 477
Yes , but the point is that Obama is neither . 
Not a high school dropout nor doing a good job . 
So , so much for DROPOUT education . 
CURRENTPOSTID 478
Well , apparently Americans are not smart enough to know . 
The record of our past Presidents is evidence of that . 
Especially true of this President . 
CURRENTPOSTID 479
I know . 
The job he has done makes HE look like a high-school dropout . 
CURRENTPOSTID 480
Please , please do not offend the high school dropout ? 
CURRENTPOSTID 482
I always tell liberals that he is the coolest and most down to earth president we have had , PRESIDENT would be fun to hang around . 
I just do n't agree with any of HE political stances though . 
CURRENTPOSTID 483
He too arrogant and self-serving not to . 
CURRENTPOSTID 484
What I see is people who disagree with his political positions calling HIS ignorant . 
Which is ignorant in IMO , IMO . 
CURRENTPOSTID 485
He 's not ignorant . 
HE knows exactly what HE is doing , but what HE is doing is wrong . 
HE does n't care what the people want , HE only cares about what HE wants HE . 
CURRENTPOSTID 486
A selfish actor , in your view ? 
Conservatives should love ACTOR . 
CURRENTPOSTID 487
Why should I love him ? 
I do n't think there is 1 thing HIM has done in office that I agree with . 
Be I guest and try to name something conservative GUEST has done ... 
CURRENTPOSTID 488
Acted in his selfish interest . 
CURRENTPOSTID 489
Ended the torture of individuals in the custody of the United States government in compliance with US law and the Constitution . 
While STATES know there are a few exceptions STATES would think that most conservatives support following US law and the Constitution but STATES could be wrong . 
CURRENTPOSTID 490
Universally true of every president in my lifetime . 
CURRENTPOSTID 491
Meanwhile the Afghanistan conflict , `` a war of necessity '' President Obama acknowledged proceeds on yet protests in America are minimal and support for the Afghanistan war diminishes . 
Obama 's foreign policy -LRB- U.S. imperialism -RRB- advocates calamity by approving the execution of Somalia pirates , the authorization of air missile strikes in Pakistan , Afghanistan and Yemen murdering innocent civilians . 
CURRENTPOSTID 492
The question being addressed was what has Obama done which conservatives would support and I guess we can through in the war in Afghanistan as something conservative support although QUESTION serves no current purpose and libertatians and liberals are fundamentally opposed to QUESTION . 
Somalia pirates have not been subjected to execution to I knowledge but the use of deadly force to protect innocents has been authorized . 
That is a normal law enforcement issue . 
Predator strikes in Pakistan are probably approved by most conservatives and perhaps some liberals and those are being done with covert Pakistan government approval from what I understand . 
Very stupid move IMO because PAKISTAN is increasing the terrorist threat against the US as we have seen with the attempted Times Square bombing . 
All Americans should oppose extra-judicial executions which are by definition a violation of the law . 
CURRENTPOSTID 493
Well , I 'm one that does n't like the man as a person . 
MAN 's arrogant , conniving and leading this country to destruction . 
Then again I suppose there were those that liked Hitler and Stalin personally until they suffered under THEY . 
You may not see the writing on the wall , but many of us do . 
For once , I 'd like to hear Obama speak up about the good of America , not always apologizing and denigrating this country . 
CURRENTPOSTID 494
You misread Obama if you think OBAMA is the coolest and most down to earth president we have had . 
OBAMA is neither . 
OBAMA is cold and calculating and the only down to earth thing about OBAMA is OBAMA desire to ` down ' America . 
CURRENTPOSTID 495
He has n't ended anything except the peace and tranquility of this nation . 
HE certainly has n't ended the torture of individuals in the custody of the U.S. government . 
Heck , I 'm tortured everyday as a citizen of this great country every time CITIZEN speaks , does something sneaky or one of his swooning liberals suck up to CITIZEN . 
Give I Gitmo . 
Oh , I 'm already at Gitmo . 
Our national security has and continues to be compromised as GITMO scars America forever . 
CURRENTPOSTID 496
RR was the exception . 
CURRENTPOSTID 497
As a person PRESIDENT is down to earth ... as a president ABSOLUTELY not ! 
I understand that , but I think you have to distinguish between the two . 
Liberals think PRESIDENT is a good president just because LIBERALS think PRESIDENT is cool . 
CURRENTPOSTID 498
Exhibiting apocryphal vernacular for the sole purpose to beguile and deceive a large segment of America 's population indicates a disoriented , mercurial individual . 
Furthermore , President Obama has evolved into a discordant hellion and a nuisance to the societal fabric of our great nation . 
CURRENTPOSTID 500
Not Mr Reagen , but very true about Bonnie & Clyde Clinton , & Fatah Obama !!! 
CURRENTPOSTID 501
I still disagree that he is cool . 
Suppose you have n't seen HE riled up yet . 
I have and so has HE staff . 
Wait until the books come out from HE underlings . 
You 'll freak out , you 'll definitely find out HE is not cool , just cold . 
HE tries to maintain an image , but the true HE is coming out as HE ca n't handle criticism , HE achilles ' heel . 
jthorp24 , throw some water on your face , awake from the daze . 
CURRENTPOSTID 502
Like so many conservatives have over George Bush ? 
George Bush loves the Satanic Rocker , Ozzy Osbourne , so very much BUSH invited Ozzy to a White House Ball on Saturday , May 4 , 2002 , where BUSH complimented BUSH and showed BUSH the best hospitality the President of the United States could lavish . 
What is a supposedly Born Again Christian President doing showering such complimentary honors on a Satanic Rocker ? 
Why is Bush stating BUSH love for Ozzy 's sickening songs , some of which BUSH names ? 
Thus , this invitation demonstrates the special regard in which President Bush holds Ozzy Osbourne . 
But , then , why should we be surprised , for Bush told WE in the quote , above , `` Ozzy , Mom loves your stuff . '' 
Mother and Son love Ozzy Osbourne . 
What does the Bible say ? 
`` Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness , but rather reprove WE . '' 
Eph 5:11 -LRB- KJV -RRB- http:\/\/www.cuttingedge.org\/news\/n1758.cfm 
CURRENTPOSTID 503
Actually Ozzy is now a christian , but good job being wrong . 
Typical liberal . 
Obama went to a racist church for years , so nice try . 
CURRENTPOSTID 504
The republican party has given him no choice but to act in a partisan manner . 
CURRENTPOSTID 505
The way Obama acts has NOTHING to do with us republicans . 
Do n't make excuses for Obama . 
CURRENTPOSTID 507
I never said Bush was cool or did I support BUSH in BUSH liberal to moderate tendencies when BUSH strayed from conservative principles or Christian values . 
I take no issue with the scripture you mentioned . 
CURRENTPOSTID 508
What ??? 
No choice ? 
The President is the president of all Americans not just the Democrats . 
PRESIDENT 's suppose to be representing all of us , PRESIDENT has a choice . 
CHOICE is PRESIDENT that steers the ship , not the Republicans . 
Now if PRESIDENT would choose to stand for America and Americans rather than choose to stand on America and be the internationalist PRESIDENT is and stop berating our history and ignoring OUR Constitution . 
Standing with Calderon at the expense of an American State . 
Ditto the Democrats in Congress who gave Calderon a standing ovation . 
Now seeing major cities boycott Arizona . 
NOW 's comical since these same cities themselves have major issues with illegal immigration and a busted economy . 
CURRENTPOSTID 509
I did n't know Obama was on the ballot yet . 
Ditto for Palin . 
Palin may have a killed a moose , but Obama is killing the golden goose . 
CURRENTPOSTID 511
Why should people believe you when PEOPLE can just go to Politifact and check POLITIFACT score ? 
http:\/\/politifact.com\/truth-o-meter\/promises\/The President has kept 113 campaign promises , which over 200 in-the-works , at some stage of completion . 
To be fair PRESIDENT has broken a handful and compromised on many . 
But to say PRESIDENT has not kept PRESIDENT campaign promises outright would be an unfair and bias thing to say . 
I voted yes and I would vote for YES , especially since the Republican 's wont offer anyone who would make a better President . 
When Libertarian 's run as Republican 's , MANY do n't win the primary . 
RUN will be another GOP crony in 2012 . 
CURRENTPOSTID 512
YOUR golden goose , huh ? 
Or , as it is more commonly known these days , the lame duck . 
Thanks to the magpies on Wall ST. 
CURRENTPOSTID 515
Sure there are some MARXIST kept , but some major ones , MARXIST did n't , like transparency , eliminating earmarks and going line by line to cut waste , tax cuts for 95 % of Americans , not being business as usual in Washington , etc. And then MARXIST is well on MARXIST way with some major destructive legislation such as HCR , Cap & Trade , Amnesty for illegals , bailouts , failed stimulus , increasing spending beyond Earth orbit , record deficit . 
MARXIST 's a Marxist , socialist , whatever , that is more interested in MARXIST legacy , power , big government bureaucracy , etc. than the American people . 
CURRENTPOSTID 516
Versus our conservative friends , who are more interested in not sharing FRIENDS wealth that what is good for the American people . 
CURRENTPOSTID 517
Stop trying to justify free-loading . 
CURRENTPOSTID 518
Sharing the wealth is a socialist principle that most Americans would oppose . 
Only those that want handouts , and refuse to work for a living . 
Why should one group support another ? 
Why should ONE hard-earned money be taken from ONE and given to someone who is lazy ? 
CURRENTPOSTID 519
Sure , when you stop trying to justify laissez-faire . 
CURRENTPOSTID 520
Good point . 
We 've seen the masses out there demanding termination of SS and medicare . 
What was the senior tea partiers were saying ? 
`` Keep the govt out of WE medicare ! '' 
LOLFor the record , I do n't support providing long term benefits to the able who are able to get a job and work and wo n't . 
Nor is that the design of WE unemployment system . 
CURRENTPOSTID 521
Certainly this nonsensical allegation is in a mandated apolitical position and should be discarded promptly . 
Current Vice President Joe -LRB- Where 's Waldo -RRB- Biden and JOE wife gave a dismal average of $ 369 per year to charities during the past decade . 
In 1988 , Democrat Al Gore was humiliated when GORE tax returns affirmed that GORE gave a lugubrious $ 353 to charity . 
In 1993 , Democrat John Kerry gave $ 175 to the deprived , impoverished . 
In 1995 , avaricious Democrat John Kerry gave a whopping zero , zilch , nada , nothing to charity . 
In the 1970 's , Ted Kennedy 's net worth of nearly $ 8 million and a annual income of approximately $ 461,400 and gave a miserable 1 percent of KENNEDY income to charity . 
CURRENTPOSTID 522
Just like not every single person who receives Govt benefits is lazy , right ? 
CURRENTPOSTID 524
True , but they still like him . 
Why ?

Being 19 myself ... a lot of MYSELF friends think MYSELF 'm weird cause MYSELF get into politics lol 
CURRENTPOSTID 528
Agreed . 
If AGREED runs against someone like Sarah Palin then the choice is obvious , but if the Republican Party changes things up and picks a viable candidate with an IQ above 100 then I would have to weigh the individual policies of each contender . 
CURRENTPOSTID 529
If she runs against someone like Barack Obama then the choice is obvious , but if the Democratic Party changes things up and picks a viable candidate with an IQ above 100 then I would have to weigh the individual policies of each contender .

Just because people wear crosses does n't make PEOPLE Christian . 
You need to read up on Ozzie , you ca n't worship Satan and be a Christian . 
If you believe that Ozzie is a Christian , you have no idea what a Christian is . 
It is apparent -LRB- Bush and Quayle -RRB- due to PEOPLE affirmation of Osbourne call good evil and evil good . 
Ozzfest 2005 ??? 
What kind of `` Christians '' would perform at a known Satanic festival ? 
Ozzy Osborne is as Satanic as can be , but ironically denies being a Satanist . 
Whether SATANIST 're a Satanist or not Ozzy , YOURSELF are 100 % Satanic !!! 
Since the year 2000 , all of Ozzy 's albums have featured the Pagan god , Pan , on the front cover . 
See for yourself : 2000 , 2001 , 2002 , 2003 , 2004 , 2005 , 2006 , 2007 and 2008 . 
One of the hottest celebrities today is the vulgar , violent and demonic Ozzy Osbourne . 
MTV recently launched the profanity-soaked The Osbournes family show . 
The Osbournes is simply filmed during Oz and family s normal -LRB- if you could possibly call OZ that -RRB- daily life . 
No acting . 
No pretense . 
Just simply being S abnormal self . 
SIMPLY s just `` family time with The Osbournes '' . 
CHRISTIANS stomached one nauseating viewing of The Osbournes -LRB- and believe CHRISTIANS that was one too many ! -RRB- 
. 
CHRISTIANS counted 51 occurrences of the `` F-word '' in a little over 15 minutes -LRB- episode `` Dinner with Ozzy '' -RRB- . 
Profanity and perversion is spewed by all the Oz kin Oz , wife , teenage daughter and son . 
Of course , MTV `` bleeps '' the worse profanity out , but the actual words are easily understood . 
In between the onslaught of f-words , and depravity , a drug-cooked-burnt-out Ozzy staggers , mumbles , shakes and screams in a state of spaced-out , confusion . 
Much of the subject matter and perverse acts can not and will not be repeated in this article but believe CHRISTIANS MUCH s sicko , sicko and sicko . 
And sicko . 
. 
Remember Dan Quayle ? 
The former vice-president , who went ballistic because TV s Murphy Brown had a baby out of wedlock . 
When asked VICE-PRESIDENT opinion of The Osbournes , Quayle replied The Osbournes were `` good entertainment '' and `` good family values '' . 
Dan did you somehow miss the episode where Oz puts condoms in QUAYLE teenagers drawers so S can have `` safe sex '' ? 
Or when Oz gives QUAYLE teenagers -LRB- Kelly 18 and Jack 15 -RRB- some `` fatherly advice '' as TEENAGERS re going out for the night , `` If you have sex use a condom '' . 
Or the zillion occurrences of the F-word . 
Plus the other quad-trillion vulgarities and perverse conversations . 
Good entertainment . 
Good family values . 
God help us .

http:\/\/www.av1611.org\/rock\/ozzy.html Obama is a Christian and at least goes to church . 
Your so-called Christian Bush does n't even go to church . 
Oh , CHRISTIANS forgot , going to church does n't make you a Christian , wearing a cross does . 
And FYI , the fact that Rev Wright called out the sins of our country does not make WRIGHT racist . 
That is a conservative 's lie , because they just want to make Obama appear bad .

I think not !!! 
CURRENTPOSTID 540
Sure they have . 
Ever hear of dumbing down the curriculum and grade inflation ? 
Part of affirmative action and political correctness . 
Besides the MCL does n't mean one has commonsense or is wise . 
Obama is living proof of this . 
CURRENTPOSTID 541
I have n't heard that Harvard law school has dumbed down the curriculum as part of affirmative action . 
Any proof of this or are THIS just demonstrating your racists beliefs ? 
The only evidence of dumbing down I 've seen are the posts I read here . 
CURRENTPOSTID 543
Actually you do n't . 
You pull up articles from years ago and read them like THEM are current . 
I 've watched MAN go on talk shows the past few months and MAN is a changed man . 
MAN 's been sober for a few years now . 
MAN is also a pretty big christian now and MAN feels really bad for the way MAN acted years ago . 
MAN lived a pretty crazy life . 
Most of the things MAN did were for show . 
I would n't expect you to know that though . 
Which just made I think ... Obama going to christian church is for show as well . 
Why would a muslim go to a christian church ? 
Cause OBAMA is the president and wants to look good . 
I do n't care if Bush went to church or not . 
You do n't have to attend church to be a christian . 
I love how every time someone brings up something bad about Obama , the liberals compare OBAMA to Bush . 
If OBAMA is the best president ever like you think why in the world would you compare OBAMA to the worst president in the history of the US -LRB- George Bush -RRB- ? 
It seems like you would set your standards higher . 
WORLD 's like the best team in the NFL comparing LIBERALS to the worst team in the NFL .

I have tried to give this man the benefit of doubt in I own mind several times , just to be embarrased for MAN . 
MAN 's a fake FAKE until you make FAKE type of man . 
MAN charisma is not charming anymore and MAN ego is over-inflated . 
A second term President . 
Lord , I hope not . 
A good , one term President ? 
Keep wishing Obama . 
CURRENTPOSTID 547
He 's run out of excuses . 
HE has n't had a press conference in the last 9 months . 
HE 's afraid to answer questions . 
Just look at the press briefing with President Calderon . 
CALDERON even signed a freedom of the press act , and finished that off with `` no questions will be taken '' . 
Daily Presidential Tracking Poll : http:\/\/www.rasmussenreports.com\/publ..._tracking_poll 
CURRENTPOSTID 548
Oh please . 
When he was having frequent press conferences conservatives complained that HE was still in campaign mode and not doing HE job . 
Now HE is working instead of having press conferences and you say HE 's too scared to answer questions . 
CURRENTPOSTID 549
Here 's today 's rasmussen report : Daily Presidential Tracking PollTuesday , May 25 , 2010 The Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll for Tuesday shows that 24 % of the nation 's voters Strongly Approve of the way that Barack Obama is performing OBAMA role as president . 
Forty-four percent -LRB- 44 % -RRB- Strongly Disapprove , giving Obama a Presidential Approval Index rating of -20 -LRB- see trends -RRB- . 
The Presidential Approval Index is calculated by subtracting the number who Strongly Disapprove from the number who Strongly Approve . 
INDEX is updated daily at 9:30 a.m. Eastern -LRB- sign up for free daily e-mail update -RRB- . 
Updates are also available on Twitter and Facebook . 
Overall , 42 % of voters say VOTERS at least somewhat approve of the president 's performance . 
That is the lowest level of approval yet measured for this president . 
Fifty-six percent -LRB- 56 % -RRB- now disapprove of PRESIDENT performanceI am one who disapproves . 
CURRENTPOSTID 551
Well , with that said . 
THAT know who you are going to vote for . 
Fair minded , you are not . 
CURRENTPOSTID 552
No , no one was complaining of NO having frequent press conferences . 
They were complaining of NO almost daily news media blitz -LRB- tour -RRB- on practically every subject known to man , even detailed information on matters not necessarily of any importance to the President of the U.S. . 
What we have discovered is the man is not the great orator many thought NO was . 
Well , perhaps when MAN uses a teleprompter but even then MAN quoted what was in many cases a screw up of the teleprompter or data MAN viewed . 
MAN does not do well when questioned and MAN has to wing TELEPROMPTER . 
Typical of some other Presidents but the difference is MAN lack of knowledge and experience which is understandable when you consider MAN background . 
I was a bit of a stutterer when I was in the 1st grade , but I did n't stutter because I did n't know the subject material . 
STUTTERER is not scared , STUTTERER 's just unprepared and does not relish to be a fool , but STUTTERER fails .

CURRENTPOSTID 554
It is really comical to hear people , who think Sarah Palin is better than sliced bread , with her journalist scholarship from 5 different colleges criticize Obama when PALIN well known to be eloquent . 
Sounds to me like sour grapes . 
We should have Bush back , with BUSH inability to complete a sentence and mispronounce every other word . 
Obama does quite well . 
OBAMA does a lot better than Sarah Palin will ever do , with MISPRONOUNCE PTA president background , and WE wo n't mention Bush , everyone knows how well BUSH used to do , bwahaha ! 
LOT has been made quite obvious that the conservatives will never warm up to OBAMA , but that is inconsequential . 
What CONSERVATIVES gave the country the last 8 years is something WE wo n't get over for a long time , but all this BS about Obama not being able to speak well , being unprepared and all else the cons are throwing out , is just that BS . 
CURRENTPOSTID 555

I like most Americans would long to have had a third term for Bush rather than what we have now that tries to pass as a President . 
President of what country ? 
Certainly not the U.S. 
CURRENTPOSTID 558
I agree . 
Obama makes a mockery of this country and the Presidency . 
OBAMA is the most anti-American politician in Washington . 
OBAMA bashed our country on OBAMA World Apology Tour , and now OBAMA sides with foreign leaders against the U.S. What 's next , a Dictator Summit ? 
OBAMA 's going to invite Ahmadinejad , Chavez , and Il to the White House to find ways AHMADINEJAD could improve AHMADINEJAD . 
CURRENTPOSTID 559
It amazes me that there are those that still think Obama has a silver tongue and is such a wonderful speaker . 
OBAMA stutters more than Porky Pig and does n't have a prayer when PIG comes to winging PIG . 
Even Bush puts the unman to shame . 
Bush may have not been the greatest orator , but BUSH was a man who obviously loved and cared about America and AMERICA people , showed strength in the face of our enemies and did n't remind PEOPLE everyday that AMERICA 's all about BUSH -LRB- as Obama does -RRB- . 
Obama does quite well doing what ??? 
One and a half-years in office and Obama and OBAMA henchmen\/women have totally run this country into the ground with no upswing in sight . 
If Bush or McCain were in office OUR would have already seen a recovery , North Korea would n't be the issue KOREA is today and Israel would know ISRAEL would n't have to go ISRAEL alone . 
You all keep supporting Obama and OBAMA failed policies and know that OUR will welcome you back when the insanity is over .

At least Bush said it the way IT was . 
BUSH did n't try to use words to BS BUSH way around . 
Obama 's ability to speak well , with a TelePrompTer and a speech written by a twenty-something year old , just enables OBAMA to deliver the BS to the sheeple so that they buy into what OBAMA is saying . 
Speaking well does not imply knowledge and competence . 
CURRENTPOSTID 562
Can we just not play the mispronunciation game ? 
GAME 's a really stupid game . 
Anyone who does a lot of speaking is going to mess up a few words . 
Besides I 'm pretty sure Bush has Obama beat in that area . 
So PATH 's not exactly the wisest path to take for a conservative .

Of which Sarah Palin has few good ones .

At least Obama does n't have to rely on a `` phonics '' teleprompter . 
And , Obama did n't have to go to `` debate camp '' to learn what foreign policy meant . 
For conservatives TELEPROMPTER does n't . 
CONSERVATIVES are satisfied with a hockey mom , who does n't read newspapers , did n't know MOM own president 's doctrine , and writes notes on MOM hands so MOM can remember what the topic is ! 
That is why CONSERVATIVES resent Obama , CONSERVATIVES do n't understand what OBAMA is saying - goes over CONSERVATIVES heads . 
CURRENTPOSTID 568
I would n't have used such a nice word . 
CURRENTPOSTID 569
Just to be clear , you are fine with Bush inviting Ozzie Osbourne to a White House dinner , praising OSBOURNE -LRB- Satanic -RRB- music and even admitting that OSBOURNE mom , Barbara Bush loves MUSIC too ? 
Interesting , for someone that refers to Christianity so often in his\/her posts . 
MOST guess there a lot of delusional conservatives who still think `` most '' Americans were fond of Bush as we kicked BUSH out of office and with a low rating to boot ! 
MOST do n't doubt RECESSION , because it appears that conservatives do n't care what state CONSERVATIVES put the country in , whether RECESSION is a depression , recession , or toilet , as long as CONSERVATIVES have CONSERVATIVES party of `` no '' at the helm . 
And , CONSERVATIVES continue to support CONSERVATIVES leaders , when CONSERVATIVES see that CONSERVATIVES are going against everything that is helpful to Americans . 
Thank God for Obama . 
MOST still believe what Romans 13 says .

Americans did not ` kick ' Bush out of office . 
BUSH successfully completed BUSH two terms as President . 
More than BO will be able to say . 
If you look back at the last year of Bush 's 2nd term , you 'll note that the downward spiral in the financial and job situation started in September 2008 , one month after BO was nominated over Hillary . 
It was BUSH nomination that started the run on Wall Street and Main Street as everyone with sense moved their money to safer environs because of THEIR concern for an Obama Presidency and BUSH radical ideas . 
We are now reaping the fruit -LRB- or more likely weeds -RRB- of BUSH unleadership and denunciation of America . 
Oh , yes . 
As part of God 's Plan , BO is an instrumental figure , but not the way you might think .

Bush could never compare to Obama in eloquence . 
Poor Bush , had to have BUSH phonics teleprompter , and still BUSH could n't pronounce the words right . 
The criticism from the right just shows what sore losers LOSERS are . 
Now that is an understatement . 
Sure BUSH did , that is why BUSH did n't mind disregarding the Constitution and telling us BUSH was `` the decider '' ? 
That was n't strength - CONSTITUTION was ignorance . 
Have n't you heard the phrase `` Ignorance is bliss . '' 
Putting the interests of people ahead of the interests of corporations , unlike Bush\/Cheney . 
Er , excuse ME , the country was already run into the ground by the time Obama took over , and for that we can thank Bush , the one that some conservatives still give OBAMA a pass on . 
If Bush or McCain were in office WE would n't be posting on this forum , the country would be so deep into depression you would have had to sell your computer to buy bread . 
How can the same policies that drove the country into the toilet take COUNTRY out ? 
Only warped conservative thinking can come up with crap like that . 
No , Bush would have WE in a war with Korea , making WE soldiers deploy there after serving in Iraq and Afghanistan without a break . 
Israel is well equipped to take care of ISRAEL . 
Why do conservatives feel like WE have to babysit Israel ? 
Welcome ME back ? 
ME 'm not going anywhere . 
And that was n't Obama 's policies that failed , those were Bush 's . 
Conservative have short memories , ME guess THOSE are now going to say that Bush actually increased the Surplus and was n't responsible for the loss of thousands of our soldiers , not to mention Iraqi citizens . 
CURRENTPOSTID 581
Gosh , OBAMA are the Obama `` model citizen . ''

How about the many trillions in debt that Obama has racked up since coming into office ? 
CURRENTPOSTID 592
While about 70 House Democrats opposed the surge in Afghanistan overwhelmingly both Democrats and Republicans supported 70 . 
We can also note that during the 2008 primaries that all of the presidential candidates except for Kucinich and Paul supported the continued US wars in the Middle East to a greater or lessor degree . 
CURRENTPOSTID 593
I bet you do ... LOL 
CURRENTPOSTID 594
It does n't count if Obama spends IT . 
Remember OBAMA has OBAMA own currency called `` Obama money . '' 
CURRENTPOSTID 595
Measuring in trillions of dollars is somewhat hard to determine for several reasons . 
First and foremost is that while a president does have influence the budget is actually established by Congress and not the president . 
Next is the fact that the 2009 budget is a Bush budget and not an Obama budget although Obama did add some spending to SPENDING . 
By comparison though in 8 years President Bush doubled the national debt and even with projected average deficits of almost a trillion dollars per year President Obama will not double the national debt that 8 inherited from the Bush adminstration even if 8 remains in office for 8 years . 
CURRENTPOSTID 596
You seem to be confusing what YOU want , with what independents want . 
What independents actually like and do n't like is simple . 
There are many politically sophisticated independents , but most independents are not . 
Most do n't know much about politics , and do n't really care to . 
So for the most part independents dislike taxes on INDEPENDENTS . 
Whether INDEPENDENTS are ok with taxes on other people is more mixed , but taxes on INDEPENDENTS are always opposed . 
INDEPENDENTS are in favor of government programs that INDEPENDENTS can clearly tell benefit INDEPENDENTS . 
So INDEPENDENTS tend to like social security , medicaid , etc. . 
INDEPENDENTS tend to dislike programs that clearly directly benefit other people , but not PEOPLE . 
Most do n't care about the drug war , but the ones who do are probably relatively evenly split , with people opposed to the drug war probably a slight majority . 
ONES might care a little about national debt and a balanced budget , but LITTLE is certainly not at the forefront of ONES mind . 
ONES definitely DO N'T want to end the war on terror , and ONES may want a rational immigration policy , but not people who feel -LRB- however justified or unjustified that feeling is -RRB- that immigrants are a threat to IMMIGRANTS jobs . 
I agree with almost every aspect of what you said , to make DO clear that I am not simply disagreeing with you for partisan reasons , but most independents DO NOT . 
INDEPENDENTS may agree with a few of those points , but INDEPENDENTS are certainly not in complete agreement on any of those points . 
CURRENTPOSTID 598
Or maybe they interpreted it as , `` will you vote for Obama if YOU have to vote for one of the 2 main parties , and Sarah Palin was the Republican candidate . '' 
Then YOU would vote yes . 
As IT stands , YOU will be voting 3rd party in the 2012 election , or not voting at all . 
CURRENTPOSTID 599
I 'd be very interested to see any polls showing that independents want to cut military , SS , medicare and medicaid spending by any significant amount .

I would vote against Obama if Bonzo the Chimp were running . 
I might possibly abstain if CHOICE were a choice between Obama and Charlie Manson , but otherwise anyone who stands even a remote chance of beating this loser and getting LOSER and LOSER thugs out of the WH will get I vote ... 
CURRENTPOSTID 601
Most independents that I have heard from want a balanced budget without tax increases and that would mandate cuts in both military and entitlement budgets because there is no other way to achieve a balanced budget . 
People are delusional if PEOPLE believe that cutting $ 15-20 billion in pork barrel spending will eliminate a trillion dollar annual deficit and I do n't believe that independents are that delusional . 
PEOPLE know what needs to be cut even though PEOPLE are probably calling for cuts in programs PEOPLE support in principle . 
CURRENTPOSTID 602
Thanks , but I 'll pass on giving credence to your anecdotal hearsay as to what independents supposedly want . 
CURRENTPOSTID 603
President Obama possesses no skill or guidance set with which to command , no knowledge base with which to govern , and no ideological base that is consistent with a republic and capitalism . 
As anyone would conjecture , OBAMA has looked moronic in OBAMA vain attempts to be the world 's unifier . 
Obama promised the most transparent administration in U.S. history despite the fact OBAMA broke numerous campaign promises . 
It is blatantly obvious that OBAMA administration is in over ADMINISTRATION head and is governing in an sophomoric , incompetent manner . 
I would vote against Obama if Pee Wee Herman were running for the Presidency . 
CURRENTPOSTID 604
This nonsensical assertion does n't nullify or exculpate the Obama administration 's lugubrious fiscal immaturity , wasteful spending like allocating nearly $ 20 million dollars courtesy the Obama stimulus to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program -LRB- Food Stamps -RRB- , $ 89 billion to provide a temporary increase in Medicaid funding that neglects to promote or stimulate job growth . 
President Obama disclosed a $ 3.55 trillion budget for fiscal year 2010 and projects a deficit of $ 1.75 trillion dollars . 
The authorization of out of control , irresponsible and reckless deficit and debt spending at unprecedented rates indicates hideous leadership and a lack of fiscal responsibility by President Obama and a pathetic led Democratic controlled Congress . 
Come 2012 , President Obama will have added over 5 + trillion dollars to The National Debt in just 4 short years . 
CURRENTPOSTID 605
My intent was not to `` nullify or exculpate the Obama administration 's lugubrious fiscal immaturity '' but instead to reflect the fact that the problem is bipartisan in nature .

http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/story\/0,2933,558700,00.htmlAs I have noted the national debt is an overwhelming concern for most independents and it is the independents who ultimately elect the president as neither the Republicans or the Democrats have enough votes to elect anyone without the support of the independents . 
BTW this is an older poll and the concerns about the debt have increased since the passage of the HCR bill which most independents opposed because of PRICETAG 's trillion dollar pricetag . 
I do n't doubt the national debt is an overwhelming concern . 
What I doubted was the most independent would favor significant cuts in military , SS , medicare and medicaid spending . 
CURRENTPOSTID 608
It 's estimated overhauling health care will cost nearly $ 1-1 .2 trillion dollars further adding to a sky rocketing National Debt and the interest payment on The National Debt , two of America 's largest expenditures . 
Furthermore , Obama proposes cutting approximately $ 500 billion dollars from Medicare depriving the the disabled , the handicapped , the mentally ill and our senior citizens access to quality health care service . 
One of the primaries goals of passing `` Obamacare '' is to drive down health care costs , however Medicare\/Medicaid and the interest payment on the National Debt are without question some of OUR government 's biggest liabilities . 
Eventually , the total cost of overhauling `` Obamacare '' will surpass rising health care costs based on the premise that the the payments of Medicare\/Medicaid and the interest payment on The National Debt will exceed overhauling `` Obamacare `` ObamaCare will increase nation 's healthcare costs . 
. 
CURRENTPOSTID 609
That is less than 1\/4 the cost of additional military spending since 2000 .

That is of course complete and total nonsense . 
Obama is just like most other Democratic or Republican politicians , which is to say incompetent and ruled over by the interests that finance OBAMA campaigns and lobby OBAMA on a daily basis . 
Anyone who thinks a Republican would be any better is delusional , and anyone who thinks POLITICIANS would be that much worse is also delusional .

Yes , WAR support massive cuts in military spending like putting an end to that `` war of necessity '' , the Afghanistan conflict President Obama once labeled . 
ROFLMAO !

POLITICIAN completely agree that POLITICIANS are -LRB- on both sides of the aisle -RRB- motivated pretty much solely by what 's in AISLE for POLITICIANS . 
That said , Obama is NOT like most other politicians . 
OBAMA sees OBAMA as some sort of revolutionary who is going to `` make America a better place to live '' by injecting massive amounts of government into OUR lives and righting the `` injustices '' suffered by minorities , gays , the poor , and just about any other voting bloc OBAMA thinks OBAMA can pander to and that might be stupid enough to swallow the prodigious piles of dog poo that spews from OBAMA mouth on a daily basis . 
Most other politicians are satisfied with sitting in POLITICIANS little offices and filling POLITICIANS greedy little pockets as POLITICIANS build POLITICIANS petty little fiefdoms within the gubment . 
You may want to go back and read POLITICIAN original post . 
Not once do POLITICIAN mention a Republican . 
POLITICIAN primary point was that POLITICIAN am aware of this man 's agenda and POINT 's dangerous . 
MAN 's attempting to make fundamental changes in this country that POLITICIAN do n't agree with . 
POLITICIAN 'm willing to take POLITICIAN chances on just about any other warm body that can fog a mirror if POLITICIAN think there 's a remote possibility they wo n't do as much damage to this country as Obama is trying to do . 
Hell , POLITICIAN 'd even vote for Hillary if POLITICIAN were able to vote in a Demoratic primary and if DEMORATIC ran as an independent POLITICIAN 'd vote for DEMORATIC over Obama in the general if POLITICIAN though the Republican candidate did n't have a chance of winning -LRB- doubtful running against Obama , but ... -RRB- . 
Not only that ... OBAMA 's black -LRB- gratuitous bone thrown as chum to the lib trolls out there , POLITICIAN 've been called a racist enough POLITICIAN figure POLITICIAN might as well just embrace the title -RRB-

Absolutely not . 
Obama uses rhetoric and tries to pretend that OBAMA is different from most other politicians , but the fact is OBAMA is n't . 
What has Obama done that is so radical ? 
The radical solution to healthcare is socialized medicine like POLITICIANS have in the UK . 
The center left solution was a public option like POLITICIANS have in many other European countries . 
What we wound up with was a compromise that benefited no one but insurance companies , who now have people mandated to buy insurance . 
A handout to insurance companies , does n't seem to radical to me . 
Not only that , but the mandate was originally Hillary 's idea , the person you say you would vote for over Obama . 
Beyond that , what has Obama done that is radical ? 
OBAMA continued both wars . 
OBAMA hired Bush and Clinton era economic advisers . 
OBAMA is anything but radical . 
Well ME take that back , OBAMA is a radical centrist . 
Well since ME am not one of those liberals , how about you do n't ?

CURRENTPOSTID 628
Could n't be more truthful . 
CURRENTPOSTID 629
While MY will not be voting for Obama in 2012 , my no vote will be irrelevant . 
Because of the electoral college , Obama will get MY vote no matter what MY do , because OBAMA will , without question , win Illinois . 
Not only will OBAMA win Illinois , but OBAMA will win reelection as well . 
The frenzied insanity Obama has caused in right wingers in this country is not shared by the vast majority of people . 
Non-political people still like Obama . 
PEOPLE count for a lot in a presidential election . 
But much more importantly , Obama will win because by 2012 , the economy will have rebounded . 
Now that simply has to do with the nature of the business cycle , but because of the nature of politics Obama will claim the credit , and OBAMA will win reelection . 
Another important reason Obama will win , is because Republicans are REALLY -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- !! 
They are incredibly incompetent , so even if Obama is incompetent as well , INCOMPETENT is not like anyone but Republican partisans think a Republican would be that much better . 
CURRENTPOSTID 630
Yes , could n't be more truthful . 
Except if you count reality in your evaluation of truth . 
If only the land of right wing fairy tales is counted , then yes `` could n't be more truthful . '' 
But if you allow that pesky reality business to get in the way , BUSINESS could n't be less truthful . 
Meaning BUSINESS is n't truthful at all . 
http:\/\/www.govexec.com\/dailyfed\/0108\/020708cdam1.htmDefense spending was at BILLION 's high point under George HW Bush in 1990 . 
BILLION was 301 billion . 
If adjusted for inflation , that would be 495 billion in todays dollars . 
Defense spending in W. Bush 's last budget was 680 billion . 
Significantly more than the spending was the last year of the cold war !! 
So yes , if you discount reality TRUTHFUL suppose that could n't be more truthful . 
But being the crazy liberal that TRUTHFUL am , TRUTHFUL like to reference reality when deciding how truthful a statement is . 
So TRUTHFUL will say the statement `` could n't be more truthful '' actually could n't be less truthful .

The odds are that Obama will not run for reelection for OBAMA may be incompetent but OBAMA is no fool . 
OBAMA sees the writing on the wall and OBAMA will not want to be ashamed of failing to get reelected . 
Still ca n't understand why OBAMA does n't mind failing in matters of importance like running the country and being a strong advocate for America . 
My money is on Hillary to run , then get stomped in the general election . 
Does n't matter which Republican will run against HILLARY . 
CURRENTPOSTID 641
Why ? 
Are his poll numbers so different than other Presidents in this stage in the game ? 
And , for the record , the last time a President declined to run for a second term was in 1968 ... 
CURRENTPOSTID 642
He is already a disgrace , who cares about HE shame that deepens each day to never before seen depths and depravity . 
Hillary will run , I 'm sure , but I hope that the GOP will be wise enough to not nominate Palin , HILLARY is attractive and strong to a degree , but presidential material , HILLARY pars Obama in that respect . 
CURRENTPOSTID 643
He will run , I disagree with BFOJ in that regard . 
Obama is an arogent ass , OBAMA thinks unequivocately that OBAMA is right , even though a clear majority was against the health care bill , for example , the leftists passed ASS anyway . 
I am not sure OBAMA will get out of the primaries though , Hillary looks better all the time , but leftists are stupid and LEFTISTS will stick with LEFTISTS man even though OBAMA is an obvious leftist loser and an incompetent boob . 
CURRENTPOSTID 644
The question will be whether the Republicans put up even greater losers than McCain and Palin in 2012 ?

I agree , I had to hold I nose while I did NOSE . 
I would have voted for Hillary if HILLARY had be the nomonee . 
HILLARY is a better canidate than McCain , and CANIDATE would hve been the first time voting for a Dem since Carter . 
I knew that Obama would be a buffoon from the very moment I saw OBAMA on a stage in Iowa . 
I was shooked that OBAMA got the ticket , much less that people actually elected OBAMA , TICKET defies logic . 
I hope and pray that people will not make the same mistake twice . 
CURRENTPOSTID 646
You have a valid point , the public is horribly ignorant , and that 's how we wound up with him in the first place . 
One thing though , the Democrats can not lean back on much , the people are decidedly against HIM health care and that is going to be big , as well as immigration just look at the Arizona numbers , the country is scared to death of the immigration situation . 
I think that will play big as well . 
The fact that HIM does not listen . 
HIM has also caused a greater divide between the races , and HIM is not going to get the white support HIM once enjoyed . 
Now , your putting NOW all in the economy and that 's a real strong point , NOW will improve and no thanks to HIM and HIM will play on NOW . 
I truly believe if HIM continues to lose the independents HIM 's gone . 
The last part of your post I will dismiss , pure partisan bull . 
We are talking about the public and not your particular take on the republicans . 
Look at Congress a horrible situation , and there is nothing partisan about that .

Agreed . 
Less pecimistically -LRB- sp -RRB- , I do not think that people will make this horendous a mistake again for awhile . 
I think that many people have awakened to the fact that character and associations matter . 
If CHARACTER gets re-elected , I will defere to this post as highly prophetic and never doubt you again . 
I hope , whoever , that you are very wrong on this score .

Obama is certainly not stupid or foolish . 
OBAMA is actually very bright . 
OBAMA is simply an incompetent president , and like all other politicians , OBAMA is more worried about pleasing OBAMA campaign financiers and lobbyists , than OBAMA is about doing what is best for this country .

We survived FDR who deviated from the Constitution more than any other president in history and was the original architect behind the national debt that WE have today . 
Yes , FDR was added to by LBJ in the ' 60 's and by several presidents who have squandered America 's wealth on military interventionism over the last 60 years but FDR was the first and worst president when FDR came to complete distain for a constitutionally limited government .

Well , that is true . 
Perhaps THAT was being a little melodramatic . 
But the point remains that Obama has made few , if any , good decisions . 
And those came at much deliberation and consternation shelled within OBAMA inability to make a decision that is driven by principle , OBAMA seeks consencus to even simple things , let alone hard things . 
Take the oil spill for instance , OBAMA is pushing SPILL all off on BP . 
which is not wrong , but OBAMA has taken no leadership role in this disaster , instead of getting skimmer recources here as quickly as possible , OBAMA placed ROLE all on hold for God only knows what reason , where RECOURCES could have been getting as much oil as possible from the open water mitigateing the amount that reached shore making impact and cleanup more manageable . 
As ROLE is , the disaster is maximized and the efforts of prevention minimized . 
ROLE an Obama thing .

Now , you explain to US , if that is the case , why would the right wing get their panties all in a wad if WING had been true that Obama was Muslim ? 
After all , we do have Muslims living here in the US and THEIR pay taxes . 
THEMSELVES , by your statement have just proven that right-wingers who call themselves Christian do n't practice what RIGHT-WINGERS preach . 
RIGHT-WINGERS want to dictate RIGHT-WINGERS beliefs to everyone else in the country , by law , if RIGHT-WINGERS can , and RIGHT-WINGERS do n't want to extend certain rights to other citizens .

An interesting perspective from our neighbors to the North and not unlike many Americans who would oppose potential candidates such Ron or Rand Paul who unquestionably support a Constitutionally limited US federal government .

COIN actually attempted to contact them regarding this disparity between the Constitution and THEM party platform but of course COIN question went unanswered . 
Whenever a question of Constitutionality is addressed to most politicans WHENEVER goes unanswered . 
COIN received the same non-response from COIN senators when COIN question NON-RESPONSE about `` legal tender '' laws and pointed out that Article I of the Constitution only allowed Congress to `` Coin Money '' -LRB- not print currency -RRB- in Section 8 and prohibited any State from making `` any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts '' in Section 10 . 
While we do n't have a State income tax in WA COIN am waiting for the day when COIN get a check from the WA government , perhaps from an overpayment of property taxes , so COIN can go to the State Treasury and demand payment in gold or silver in compliance with Article I Section 10 of the US Constitution . 
COIN wonder why no one has done this before ? 
Perhaps NON-RESPONSE have and COIN am merely unaware of ONE but ONE certainly reflects that the `` legal tender '' laws are unconstitutional IMO . 
If the States can only make payment in gold and silver under the Constitution then the federal government which is subject to the rule of the States can not do that which the States can not do . 
The States can not authorize that which NON-RESPONSE are prohibited from doing .

The blue dog democrat that side with the Republicans are those that are more interested in keeping their jobs in conservative infested states , than what is good for the country , and THOSE are in the minority , just like the reps. Calling Obama socialist is a phrase coined by Bush Limbaugh , repeated by the GOP Media , Fox News and company , and all the conservatives who have no earthly idea what true socialism is , but find SIDE comforting to make that assumption about Obama , because that way THOSE do n't have to expose THOSE true reasons , prejudice ad bigotry . 
Socialists claim calling Obama a socialist is ABSURDObama 's not Socialist , I should knowObama 's tax policy not Socialist 
CURRENTPOSTID 703
Rush Limbaugh calls socialist and communists evil people and PEOPLE want to destroy `` this '' country , yet whenever LIMBAUGH defines socialism and communism it 's always psuedo-Stalinism . 
Glenn Beck , on the other hand , is completely insane . 
BECK believes progressives are the most evil kind of people in the world , and BECK thinks Woodrow Wilson , a progressive , created eugenic camps . 
The truth is , THIS believe Sparta was the first to do so . 
CURRENTPOSTID 705
That 's because Reagan was President . 
Obama is nothing but a talking head , empty suit . 
CURRENTPOSTID 706
Implying Reagan -LRB- surprised nobody can actually spell REAGAN last name -RRB- was nothing else either . 
CURRENTPOSTID 707
I am usually very conscientious with spelling but let that one slip by . 
SLIP is corrected . 
Reagan was far superior to Obama , and those that compare Obama to Reagan are very insulting to Reagan . 
CURRENTPOSTID 708
While Obama is anything but competent , I can say the same about Reagan . 
That 's just I , though . 
CURRENTPOSTID 710
It 's actually easy to answer , at least if you are not a democrat or liberal-leaning independent . 
The odds of Obama adopting a conservative or `` Republican '' platform during the next couple of years is extremely remote . 
If you are the polar opposite of the majority of OBAMA policies today , BET 's a fair bet you 're going to the polar opposites of the majority of OBAMA policies come election time . 
CURRENTPOSTID 711
He has already adopted much of the `` Republican '' platform . 
Most notably on foreign policy issues . 
Where HE has changed the way the president talks , but has done very little to change the way the president acts . 
HE has also failed to pass meaningful financial reform , and appointed Timothy Geithner , a man who played a major role in the Bush administration , as BUSH treasury secretary . 
HE has obviously deviated on many issues as well , but the narrative some right wing fantasy story tellers -LRB- aka fox news and Am radio -RRB- have been propagating , about Obama 's radical agenda is completely detached from reality . 
There is more than enough there for any rational and independent minded conservative to like . 
TELLERS may not like many things , specifically the increased spending -LRB- though NARRATIVE did n't bother TELLERS under Bush -RRB- , but there are many issues on which TELLERS could come to agreement . 
SPENDING just happens that Obama sparks an irrational hatred among most people on the right , and that causes PEOPLE to invent reasons to hate OBAMA more than reality could ever dictate . 
CURRENTPOSTID 712
You think Obama is any different than Bush ? 
Seriously ... 
CURRENTPOSTID 713
I agree that he 's similar to Bush , particularly in foreign affairs . 
As for the rest , REST 's extremely debatable . 
Bush might have been a republican , but few would seriously call BUSH conservative . 
Stating that BUSH 's adopted a republican platform is a stretch of enormous proportions . 
Not being able to carry out BUSH original promises does n't equal adoption of the opposite stance . 
Most new presidents fail miserable when ADOPTION comes to delivering on PRESIDENTS campaign promises . 
You seem to have pretty strong feelings there , frodly . 
Maybe conservatives are n't the only ones with an irrational hatred . 
Just because someone does n't agree with Obama does n't mean he 's being called radical . 
You seem to be under the impression that the hatred for the opposing team in something new ; IMPRESSION 's not . 
The democrats were absolutely rabid towards Bush . 
CURRENTPOSTID 714
I dislike Obama as much as bush . 
I simply reject the conservative position being taken of late , that Obama is the worst most evil politician in the world , when the reality is , OBAMA is just like pretty much all politicians . 
I should say OBAMA is like all Democratic and Republican politicians , which means lacking in true principles and only loyal to the interests that fund OBAMA campaign and lobby OBAMA on a daily basis . 
CURRENTPOSTID 715
Bush was much worse then Obama , but that still does not make Obama good enough for me to vote for OBAMA . 
CURRENTPOSTID 717
Obviously most Americans also considered McCain\/Palin worse than Obama and did vote for Obama which is why OBAMA was elected . 
The 2012 elections will probably hinge on the same fundamental decision . 
Obama maybe bad but is OBAMA worse than who the Republicans will run against OBAMA . 
On a side note if we compared McCain and Palin I would state that McCain was superior to Palin -LRB- even though MCCAIN is a dinosaur of politics -RRB- and the Palin choice obviously hurt McCain in the election . 
The Republicans would certainly reflect absolute stupidity to run the worst part of their 2008 ticket as THEIR 2012 presidential candidate . 
Hopefully THEIR will actually nominate a good candidate but PART is doubtful based upon past history . 
CURRENTPOSTID 719
One of the problems we have is that elections are not carried by voting for candidates so much as voting against candidates . 
I believe Obama was elected with the support of independents who were fundamentally voting against the McCain\/Palin ticket . 
SUPPORT was a choice between `` two evils '' and the independents selected the lessor of the two evils . 
Americans will probably be faced with the same choice in 2012 . 
CURRENTPOSTID 721
I do n't think so , but you are entitled to your opinion . 
Obama has done more damage in 1 1\/2 years than Bush did in all 8 . 
CURRENTPOSTID 722
Let 's see , the entire economy was imperiled by the Bush adminstration 's lack of attention and neglect of the United States while off waging wars based upon unsupported and often false allegations which resulted in as many as one million innocent people dying while also leaving the government with over a trillion dollar budgetary deficit in 2009 and having doubled the entire national debt in only 8 years . 
FAN 'm not a fan of Obama 's but OBAMA is going to have to do quite a bit more the equal the damage done to the United States by the prior adminstration . 
CURRENTPOSTID 723
I really ca n't see how he 's the same as Bush . 
HE 's working to get DADT repealed . 
HE passed a major stimulus bill that Bush would have never touched . 
And HE completely reformed healthcare in a way Bush never would have done . 
Not to mention HE has a more sensible tax plan and HE policies are actually improving the economy rather than destroying ECONOMY . 
HE 's not perfect . 
But HE 's leagues above Bush . 
CURRENTPOSTID 726
Besides for the throw in about globalists -LRB- that is a small thing anyways -RRB- , HE agree with almost your entire post . 
HE also voted for Obama , and HE now regret NOW and will never vote for Obama , or a Democrat of any kind for that matter , ever again . 
You are right . 
HE was too young to remember Clinton . 
HE became politically aware under Bush , and all HE knew was that Bush was a really terrible president . 
HE figured that if we got Bush out , IMPROVEMENT would be a major improvement , and HE really had high expectations for Obama . 
Instead BUSH passed a mandate that required all people to give more money to private health care companies . 
BUSH has failed to stop rendition , close Guantanamo , stop torture , get WE out of Iraq , open talks with Iran , etc. . 
HE do n't necessarily agree with all of those issues -LRB- guantanamo for example is just political football , even if WE closed RENDITION WE just would have moved the people somewhere else without actually changing anything substantial -RRB- , but if BUSH had lived up to those promises RENDITION would show HE that BUSH is not just any other politician . 
He of course has not . 
HE now realize is NOW is all political theater . 
There is no right wing or left wing media , there is only the corporate media . 
NBC , Fox , CNN , and all other news networks all receive their revenues from advertising dollars from the exact same corporations . 
CNN is the interests of those corporations the media represents , not any ideological viewpoint . 
CORPORATIONS simply need to have fox news distract right wingers from the legitimate issues facing this country , and all other media sources to distract all other people from the legitimate problems facing this country . 
As you said , anyone who thinks there is a major difference between Democrats and Republicans in action is a twit . 
There rhetoric may be radically different , but when was the last time a conservative balanced the budget and when was the last time a liberal passed a significant piece of social welfare legislation that was not just a giant handout to health care providers ? 
Bush and Reagan spent like drunk sailors , and Clinton gutted welfare . 
SAILORS do n't actually live up to the rhetoric that SAILORS spout . 
It is simply a way to keep the normal people of this country occupied . 
So PEOPLE make up fake issues like Obama is a socialist , or look at how much Sarah Palin spent on shoes , or Michael Jackson died -LRB- even better -RRB- , or any other element of the political or pop culture circus to distract us all from the political realities currently facing this country . 
CURRENTPOSTID 728
That video is something put together by a schizophrenic lunatic , and anyone who takes EMBARRASSMENT seriously is an embarrassment to the human race . 
With all the legitimate criticisms that can be made of any politician , Barrack Obama very much included , why are right wingers obsessed with the most insane and off the wall criticisms . 
OBAMA was actually born in Kenya !! 
OBAMA is a Marxist !! 
OBAMA never actually went to college . 
And on and on . 
I see this stuff , and can not imagine how a human being could take BEING seriously , and HEIGHT worries I to no end , to know that many people do in fact take HEIGHT seriously . 
HEIGHT is the height of irrationality . 
I try to give people the benefit of the doubt as much as is possible , but many of the right wingers on this forum make FORUM very difficult . 
CURRENTPOSTID 729
Say what you want . 
I do n't trust this guy . 
History will show GUY is a fraud . 
CURRENTPOSTID 730
I do n't trust AGENT either !! 
That does n't mean I think AGENT is actually a Muslim Marxist double agent from Kenya !! 
CURRENTPOSTID 732
Obama is one of the most conservative democrats to run in awhile . 
On a global standard OBAMA 's center right . 
Most of major accomplishments have been too conservative for those on the left . 
CURRENTPOSTID 733
You are out of your mind man . 
Name one president who passed -LRB- borrowed from the chinese -RRB- a 800 BILLION dollar `` stimulus '' and passed a 4 TRILLION dollar healthcare welfare plan for fat lazy poor people to get free drugs . 
Osama is by far the most EXTREME lefty to ever step foot in the White House . 
And look what happens . 
.10 % unemployment and 6 million lost jobs 
CURRENTPOSTID 734
Just because he has n't come through on various things promised does n't necessarily mean HE leans less to the left than previouslythought . 
It just means that HE has failed to accomplish what was promised . 
CURRENTPOSTID 735
Yeah , you 're right , Bush only spent 700 Billion in BUSH last days and spent 11 trillion largely on a war of choice in Iraq . 
CURRENTPOSTID 736
Bush passed a 1.8 trillion dollar stimulus comprised completely of corporate tax cuts . 
also BUSH 600 dollar tax rebate stimulus cost about 150 billion . 
Reagan 's tax cuts cost us even more than Bush 's as a percentage of US GDP . 
CURRENTPOSTID 737
The ENTIRE war for 7 years while Bush was in office was 600 Billion dollars , for 7 years of war . 
Where in the hell are you getting 11 Trillion dollars brah ? 
CURRENTPOSTID 740
You know , thats a good question . 
I do believe I heard QUESTION somewhere but now I 'm not sure . 
I 'll cop to that . 
I withdraw the figure and apologize . 
Seriously , I apologize . 
CURRENTPOSTID 741
Get on the bandwagon my friend !! 
MY will either not vote , or vote for some independent liberal . 
MY would vote for nader , but MY do n't think LIBERAL will run again . 
Hopefully some one takes LIBERAL place , and MY will vote for them . 
CURRENTPOSTID 742
I 'll end up voting for somebody that 'll get like 0.3 % of the vote , but at least I 'll feel better . 
God knows I 'm not voting Republican . 
CURRENTPOSTID 743
Yep same here . 
I will vote for some one who gets almost no votes , but I will feel better than voting for Obama or any other Democrat , and I would never vote for a Republican either . 
CURRENTPOSTID 744
Reagan 's tax cuts did no such thing . 
THING was spending increases on thepart of a democrat controlled congress . 
CURRENTPOSTID 745
How will assisting in your own sides loss make you feel better ? 
CURRENTPOSTID 746
If Obama runs again , I think OBAMA will win . 
But independent of this , why should I vote for anybody for any other reason than because I agree with them ? 
CURRENTPOSTID 747
Obama has n't really changed OBAMA philosophical stance on the issues , what 's `` not '' to agree with ? 
CURRENTPOSTID 748
I would have voted for him in 2008 if I was old enough to . 
HIM ran to the left of where HIM 's been during HIM time in office . 
I do n't think that 's debatable . 
CURRENTPOSTID 749
I most certainly is debatable , Just because he has failed to come through on certaincampaign promises does n't mean HE 's changed HE philisophicalstances . 
It simply means HE failed to come through as promised . 
CURRENTPOSTID 750
It 's not that SOCIALIST has n't come through , IT 's how SOCIALIST goes about not coming through , SOCIALIST dig ? 
SOCIALIST 's too willing to compromise to the Nth degree with a party that will vote against everything NTH or the Democrats propose , a party that has a significant portion that believes SOCIALIST is a Socialist and\/or SOCIALIST 's not even a citizen of this country . 
CURRENTPOSTID 751
Obama will receive your vote again . 
When the election finally gets here you 'll realize even more just how important your vote is , and will not want to waste VOTE on some nobody candidate . 
You will then hold your noseand hit the switch for Obama once again . 
CURRENTPOSTID 752
Would n't it be good to see him push for HIM policies even when HIM does n't have the votes at the time when the bill is introduced ? 
I totally agree with your post on HIM being pragmatic . 
However , there is a time to go with the crowd and there is a time to lead . 
I have n't seen HIM lead much . 
CURRENTPOSTID 753
Compromise ? 
He could care less what the republicans want . 
What happened with health care should be plentyevidence of that . 
CURRENTPOSTID 754
They threw in a bunch of amendments I do recall . 
CURRENTPOSTID 755
Those amendments mean little to nothing in overall scheme of things . 
What 's more important is that none of the republicans voted for it . 
CURRENTPOSTID 756
They were n't going to vote for it no matter what he proposed . 
CURRENTPOSTID 757
I guarantee you that I wo n't . 
CURRENTPOSTID 758
No , it means NO rhetoric does not match NO action . 
I do n't care what Obama says OBAMA believes , I do n't care what OBAMA philosophical stances are , I care what OBAMA actions are . 
OBAMA actions are unacceptable . 
For I to forgive those actions because I agree with many of the things OBAMA says would be very stupid . 
CURRENTPOSTID 759
No what is important is that there was no public option , and there was a mandate . 
A mandate that is basically a giant handout to health care providers . 
There has also been no significant financial reform . 
No further environmental reform . 
No comprehensive progressive energy bill . 
The Republicans voted against COMPREHENSIVE as political theater . 
They spent a year convincing THEY followers that obama was an evil socialist , and that health care reform was an example of evil socialism . 
YEAR would have been impossible for THEY to have then voted for the bill . 
YEAR also perpetuates the myth that there is some fundamental difference between the 2 parties . 
Both parties are controlled by the same special and corporate interests , and persuaded by the same lobbyists on a daily basis . 
SPECIAL is the interests of those groups both parties represent , not any overarching ideology . 
Why would I vote for one party over the other , when the outcomes on every important issue are going to be pretty much the same . 
CURRENTPOSTID 760
Even if that were true , so what ? 
The democrats managed to win a super majority and the republicans did n't `` and still do n't '' have the power to stop anything . 
CURRENTPOSTID 761
They do n't have to as long as the Democrats ' own majority does that for THEY . 
All the GOP has to do is vote no. . 
CURRENTPOSTID 762
What ever direction the GOP votes right now is irrelevant . 
They simply do n't have the numbers to stop the democrats . 
CURRENTPOSTID 763
The Democrats stop the Democrats . 
That 's the point . 
CURRENTPOSTID 764
You 're kind of missing the point , POINT being said that his recent actions -LRB- or lack thereof -RRB- is proof that HIS has all of the sudden shifted right philosophically . 
I believe when KIND comes to HIS ideology HIS is as liberal as HIS ever was . 
CURRENTPOSTID 765
If the process gets stopped up with the number of democratscurrently in office then you need to focus on what wrong with THEN , not the republicans . 
CURRENTPOSTID 766
I am . 
That 's been the focus of I posts in this thread . 
Btw , FOCUS looks like you 're posting in Blank Verse lol . 
CURRENTPOSTID 767
What are you saying ?? 
That supports my position , POSITION does not weaken POSITION . 
Democrats had a super majority for almost a year . 
They could have gotten a public option , real financial reform , reformed social security in a liberal fashion , improved the welfare state , etc. . 
What did THEY do instead ? 
THEY got almost nothing done in that year , and then blamed Republicans for stopping THEY , when as you pointed out , Republicans had no means by which to stop THEY . 
So THEY are full of -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- . 
Why would MY vote for THEY ? 
CURRENTPOSTID 768
That is because your belief is clearly based on irrational partisanship . 
If you instead based your beliefs on reality , your beliefs would quickly change . 
CURRENTPOSTID 770
Does that mean yes then ? 
Or is MEAN the same as no , which would then make me think you could just use the no option available ... 
CURRENTPOSTID 771
I give you props for that .

CURRENTPOSTID 772
I also vote for this . 
CURRENTPOSTID 773
Remember , this is what the republican leader , Rush Limbaugh , wants .

interestingthere are estimated 20 million people who listen to Limbaugh . 
I do n't know if that is occasional listeners or some type of solid daily number . 
There are approx 55 million registered Republicans . 
We will leave out IndependentsSo , you assume to know what Limbaugh thinks . 
INDEPENDENTSSO has been clear that INDEPENDENTSSO wants the country to succeed . 
You also assume that the 20 million listeners will do exactly as they are told by LimbaughWhat then becomes of the other 35 million who do n't listen ? 
do you have any more talking points ?

SAME does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that when someone `` says '' I want Obama to fail , SAME is the same as saying `` SCIENTIST want the country to fall '' . 
Obama 's failure would only be seen\/recognized if the country was in the toilet , as was seen when Bush was in office . 
Fortunately , FAILURE was near the end of OBAMA term and Americans had sense enough not to vote in OBAMA clone with OBAMA airhead cohort . 
CURRENTPOSTID 787

Because we heard on Faux News that NEWS took him a month ! 
-LRB- Just kidding -RRB- . 
But , FACT is a fact , Faux News commentators are still claiming that no foreign ships have been allowed to help , but that is not true . 
As usual , Fox News spreads lies before doing some fact checking . 
The administration says foreign vessels are already helping to combat the worst U.S. oil spill so a blanket waiver isn t needed . 
There are a lot of foreign vessels operating offshore , Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen , the government s incident commander , told reporters on June 25 . 
The Coast Guard would be happy to aid in requests for waivers , but to date , since REPORTERS re operating outside 3 miles , no Jones Act waiver has been required .

I want Obama to fail as well . 
MINUTES 's only 3 minutes , please listen , 3 gives the perfect example . 
CURRENTPOSTID 792
That 's right . 
THAT do n't like Obama 's policies so THAT want the economy to fail because that will help OBAMA be defeated . 
If a couple million more Americans lose their jobs , THEIR savings , and THEIR homes , that 's OK as long as MILLION leads to a Republican victory . 
We see that attitude from a number of conservatives . 
Very patriotic . 
CURRENTPOSTID 793
Did you even watch the video ? 
I do n't want this country to turn socialist , Obama succeeding means this . 
Why would I want that ? 
That 's not America . 
I do n't care if you think I 'm patriotic or not , I 'm way more of an American than you will ever be . 
CURRENTPOSTID 794
Sure . 
If the economy grows and is successful , then Obama succeeds . 
Which Rush and OBAMA acolytes are against -LRB- because OBAMA might raise ACOLYTES taxes and OBAMA 'd have to buy a smaller mansion -RRB- . 
Thus OBAMA wants the economy to fail , even if millions more Americans lose MILLIONS jobs and homes , because then Obama fails . 
Which is why Rush and the other Murdoch mouthpieces constantly emphaisize the negative about the economy and ignore the positives . 
MILLIONS know that if MILLIONS can help create less confidence in the economy , that will help drag M.O. down . 
That has been the M.O. since day 1 . 
Very patriotic . 
CURRENTPOSTID 795
Ah , racism . 
Gotta love GOTTA . 
CURRENTPOSTID 796
He was n't talking about the economy . 
The economy is going to fail under Obama regardless because OBAMA has no idea what OBAMA is doing . 
ECONOMY 's more about socialism\/communism . 
We do n't want the government having more control and telling WE what to do ! 
WE would rather see higher tax rates than that . 
WE want WE freedoms in the great capitalistic society . 
Any American who wants the government controlling more things in the private sector is just wrong and completely un-american . 
CURRENTPOSTID 798
Turn on Rush on any given day and he is constantly talking about how badly the economy is doing . 
IMO , if you feel that way , the patriotic and American thing to do would be to try to elect representatives who share your view and you can repeal the health care and deprive those tens of millions of Americans of health care coverage and everything will be hunky dory for you again like CARE was . 
But hoping the economy goes to the -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- can so Obama fails while millions lose MILLIONS jobs and homes is not . 
In my opinion .

CURRENTPOSTID 801
It is obvious that you are so into Rush that you fail to see what he says to mean other than what HE tries to explain that it means . 
Our country is not a football team competing to win a game . 
If Obama fails , that means OBAMA policies have put the country in jeopardy . 
The country loses . 
Your conservative policies did just that to OUR country , and OUR came pretty darn close to failing . 
Why is THAT so hard for conservatives to understand that ? 
There is no failure for Obama without the entire country failing . 
Sorry , I 'm not comatose , I know exactly what Rush meant , no matter how RUSH tries to sugar coat MATTER . 
The man is an idiot . 
CURRENTPOSTID 802
Ah , so by making a racist comment , you then catch the racists ? 
Conservative logic ? 
CURRENTPOSTID 803
Actually Obama is an idiot . 
OBAMA does the opposite of what the public wants on every topic . 
Rush ca n't harm the country , Obama can and OBAMA is .

CURRENTPOSTID 807
A world pariah ? 
Since when has the United States been anything but the most powerful political force on the planet ? 
And a `` laughing stock '' ? 
Maybe you care what some elitist European snobs think about this country but I sure as hell do n't . 
SNOBS can kiss I big fat American butt . 
Such outlandish hyperbole . 
Under Reagan , the economy boomed and millions of new jobs were created , and what civil rights were eroded during REAGAN term , specifically ? 
And I guess you forgot who bailed out all the rich bankers and received the most campaign contributions from Goldman Sachs . 
That would be Obama . 
P.S. - I noticed your vote has nothing to do with how good a President Obama has been or would be .

WE speak out and WE do n't let the government tell WE what to do . 
CURRENTPOSTID 826
I 'll say this . 
FWIW , the American Right is more consolidated and focused than the Left , and thus we have groups like the Tea Party .

OBAMA 's full of -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- . 
OBAMA lies . 
Does n't care what the people want . 
OBAMA 's destined to drive this country straight into the ground . 
Any candidate that we put out there will be a much better candidate than Obama . 
CURRENTPOSTID 828
Sarah Palin , Ron Paul ... that was easy . 
CURRENTPOSTID 829
Wake up . 
Obama 's approval rating are in free fall mode right now . 
OBAMA has n't done anything positive since OBAMA was in office . 
All we do is spend , spend , and spend , which equates to waste , waste , and waste . 
Obama will not be re-elected in 2012 , 2012 's just that simple . 
CURRENTPOSTID 830

CURRENTPOSTID 834
Sarah Palin is a joke . 
If she wins the Republican Primary -LRB- which I admit , is disturbingly possible , -RRB- then Obama 's win in 2012 is practically assured . 
Heck , if Palin 's OBAMA opponent , I 'll be voting for PALIN . 
Ron Paul ... that 's trickier . 
PAUL 's got a good grassroots movement , and PAUL actually uses the internet -LRB- as do PAUL followers -RRB- . 
The problem is , the Republicans want to tank PAUL hard . 
The fact that PAUL 's an actual conservative hurts PAUL here . 
PAUL criticizes PAUL own party as much as PAUL does the Democrats -LRB- indeed , I found out today while watching a YouTube clip of an interview with Ron Paul that PAUL expressed the same sentiment that I express all the time . 
Granted INTERVIEW was an old interview , so PAUL probably used INTERVIEW first . 
The Republicans were brought in to fix things , and INDEED just made things worse . 
So the Democrats were brought in to fix things , and INDEED did just what INDEED said INDEED would : increase spending and taxes . -RRB- 
But I do n't think Paul has a chance . 
PAUL 'll have the establishment of both parties against PAUL . 
Not to mention the media -LRB- or specifically Fox News -RRB- hates PAUL . 
CURRENTPOSTID 835

Alas . 
Exactly which `` big tax increase '' are you referring to ? 
http:\/\/www.taxfoundation.org\/publications\/show\/151.html I love HTTP:\/\/WWW.TAXFOUNDATION.ORG\/PUBLICATIONS\/SHOW\/151.HTML when Barack supporters talk about responsible spending . 
: P 
CURRENTPOSTID 888
Unfortunately , unlike Reagan , we do n't have the luxury today -LRB- in large part because of REAGAN policies -RRB- of having a low debt to GDP ratio where WE can afford to triple the deficits and debt . 
Social Security in 1983 , and Deficit Reduction Act 1984 I agree . 
I supported Clinton because she was the one who was most serious about this issue and had the best plan to address the deficits . 
CURRENTPOSTID 889
ME do n't care what the economy is doing , it is never a good idea to try to spend your way into prosperity . 
Never . 
ME gave you a link to tax rates . 
ME believe you are confusing tax revenues with tax rates . 
Show me where personal income tax rates went up . 
ME 'm not saying they did n't . 
ME just ca n't find it . 
McCain may not have been a great candidate , but MCCAIN had far more credibility on the spending issue than any of the democrats . 
CURRENTPOSTID 890
I agree . 
IDEA can be a good idea to spend your way out of a recession\/depression cycle , however . 
I did n't say personal income tax rates went up . 
SS tax rates when up about 20 % , from 5 % to 6 % http:\/\/www.ssa.gov\/OACT\/ProgData\/taxRates.htmlThe 1984 act was a landry list of tax code changes . 
The effects are summarized here : http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/ReaganomicsThis link also notes a 1982 tax increase as well : http:\/\/www.capitalgainsandgames.com\/...-tax-increasesMcCain may not have been a great candidate , but CANDIDATE had far more credibility on the spending issue than any of the democrats . 
-LRB- \/ quote -RRB- 
CURRENTPOSTID 892
Really ? 
So in your mind , 15 % unemployment is preferable to a larger deficit and debt ? 
The largest problem with that argument , is that when you have a recession or a depression , you will lose large amounts of revenue anyways . 
You could say , we need to cut spending in response to those decreases in revenue , but that would lead to very undesirable economic outcomes . 
WE could also raise taxes to make up for the loss in revenue , again the problem is that will also lead to undesirable economic outcomes . 
So how do you deal with the problem ? 
The answer is , ANSWER is very difficult in WE current political climate . 
It is n't very difficult solution either , but political posturing makes sane economic decisions almost impossible . 
What some one with some knowledge of economics would say , is that you balance the budget over the business cycle , not on a year to year basis . 
Which means spending and tax policy should fluctuate . 
When their is a recession or a depression , you raise spending and cut taxes , which then stimulates the economy . 
When the economy is booming , you cut spending and raise taxes . 
The economy can handle those changes in times of prosperity , and then you make up for the deficits that are accrued during tough economic times . 
The problem is our economic policy is not particularly rational . 
Neither side ever cuts spending during good economic times , and Republicans oppose tax hikes at all times . 
That makes conducting policy in a reasonable way , meaning balancing the budget over the business cycle , almost impossible . 
Instead OUR have Republicans who want to cut taxes , without actually enacting spending cuts , all while the economy is strong . 
And democrats who want to raise taxes , but want to do so even when ECONOMY is economically inadvisable . 
ECONOMY is economic posturing , and ECONOMY is very bad for the country . 
CURRENTPOSTID 893
Nice leap of logic . 
I believe that Barack 's spending spree cost jobs and prevented growth . 
IMO , IMO has changed a slow recovery into a stagnate one . 
Do the math . 
CURRENTPOSTID 894
No , I am not making a leap in logic . 
I was asking you a hypothetical question . 
I was not claiming that without increased spending , we would have 15 &#37; unemployment , though I feel confident SPENDING would be higher . 
I am asking a simple hypothetical and philosophical question about the importance of combating unemployment measured against the importance of combating debt . 
CURRENTPOSTID 895
The question does not make sense . 
The spending bill hurt the recovery , IMO . 
CURRENTPOSTID 896
The question makes perfect sense . 
Despite your beliefs , the idea that government spending stimulates the economy is not very controversial among economists . 
It is widely accepted to be true -LRB- though a minority does exist that questions that fact -RRB- . 
You may believe that the stimulus did not do enough to justify STIMULUS 's costs , but to claim STIMULUS hurt recovery , is first of all unprovable , and second of all actually a leap of logic on your part . 
What evidence do you have to support your claim that the stimulus hurt the recovery ? 
What economic reasoning do you have , if no evidence exists ? 
Simply stating you believe something , without offering an explanation for why that belief exists , does not make much sense . 
CURRENTPOSTID 898
The only people guilty of fraud are the birther `` experts '' you follow . 
CURRENTPOSTID 899
Yeah , the only thing Obama is guilty of is war crimes , taking bribes , and violating the constitutional rights of Americans via domestic spying . 
God , if GONNA 're gonna hate and condemn the man , at least hate and condemn GOD for legitimate reasons . 
The whole problem is there has n't been any CHANGE . 
The only change is the change in your pocket that amounts to your life savings after being robbed by the capitalist class while Obama was picking REAGAN butt and being taught by Bill Clinton how to be the black Bill Clinton who REAGAN was the democratic Ronald Reagan . 
Real change would be De-Reaganization . 
CURRENTPOSTID 901
You clearly do not understand how the unemployment rate is determined . 
RATE has nothing to do with collecting unemployment benefits or not . 
RATE has to do with actively seeking employment vs not seeking employment . 
There are some people who do want to work , but are not seeking work , who are not in the work force , but how do you determine that number ? 
WORK is impossible , so basically you or some one else , just made that number up . 
CURRENTPOSTID 902
Frodly , there are people who believe that unemployment benefits are job creators too . 
Do I have to prove what a stupid idea that is too ? 
Some kinds of govt spending do stimulate the economy . 
I never said SPENDING could n't . 
Dollar for dollar , you ca n't beat DEFENSE spending for economic growth . 
Another nice thing about defense spending is that THING is actually authorized by the Constitution . 
I have no link to prove that the economy would be better off without the porkulus bill . 
You have no link to prove that the economy would be worse . 
I do n't see the point in butting heads . 
POINT 's bizarre that you say I opinion is unprovable , but yours is `` widely accepted to be true '' . 
You want economic reasoning ? 
How about human nature ? 
That money will have to come from somewhere , frodly . 
$ 800,000,000,000 . 
We all know where MONEY will have to come from . 
WE all know that budgets get bigger , not smaller . 
Economic growth comes from risks . 
There 's nothing in the porkulus bill that encourages risks . 
The sheer size of BILL discourages risk . 
SIZE 's human nature . 
Go ahead and ignore SIZE . 
Not I . 
CURRENTPOSTID 903
I have very simple economic reasoning to support I position . 
The current economic crisis is not a supply problem , CRISIS is a matter of insufficient demand . 
Government spending boosts aggregate demand , therefore boosting the economy . 
Not only that , but unemployment insurance undoubtedly stimulates the economy . 
There is no doubt that INSURANCE also offers a work disincentive , but in economic downturns , that disincentive is pretty irrelevant . 
People are not out of work at the moment , because PEOPLE get unemployment insurance , and therefore have no reason to look for work . 
PEOPLE are out of work , because the housing bubble burst , and we had a large economic downturn . 
Removing or reducing unemployment benefits might cause a few people to get jobs PEOPLE are most likely overqualified for , but the reality is WE would till have millions of people who can not find work !! 
What do you do with those people ? 
If the government gives PEOPLE unemployment benefits , PEOPLE will spend that money , thereby stimulating the economy . 
GOVERNMENT is n't that complicated either . 
Unemployed people use the income PEOPLE receive from the government , which then increases demand , consumption , etc. . 
Which then can create jobs . 
While there is strong evidence to suggest it is a disincentive to work , DISINCENTIVE also certainly creates jobs for others !! 
CURRENTPOSTID 905
Just posting some info . 
I never implied INFO to be gospel or a future prediction .

The govt spending money it does n't have is fake demand , frodly .

Remember everybody got 300-600 ? 
Michelle Obama said once we bought earrings , ONCE would be gone . 
At least that money was supposedly going to disposable income . 
Unemployment benefits do not . 
This kind of thinking has got to stop .

You are right , RIGHT is not that much .

To get the economy stimulated and hold unemployment to 8 % , RIGHT ? 
Of course ECONOMY was . 
A funny thing though , after getting BO `` stimulus '' passed right away , BO is still holding over half of the money . 
STIMULUS wonder why ?

I was only addressing your first point . 
But I comments on your second point are two :1 -RRB- You do n't know that the tax cuts did not create jobs . 
They may have created lots of jobs , :1 just that the number of jobs being lost from the recession was greater until recently .2 -RRB- Tax cuts wo n't create more jobs in the near term if those who receive the tax cuts do n't spend the money and instead save MONEY or use MONEY to pay down debt , as was happening in this recession . 
That 's why tax cuts are not a panacea and do n't work as well as direct spending for creating jobs in a recession .

So no court involved , BP gives up $ 20 Billion . 
Why ? 
Because BO was ` silly putty ' in the hands of smart businessmen . 
Long before the meeting BUSINESSMEN decided how much BUSINESSMEN 'd go .

Before MAN was elected , President Bush increased our debt to 10.3 trillion , today TRILLION is 13 trillion ... far less increase . 
The only way OUR can be sure of that , is come November 2012 , otherwise OUR must assume that MAN is working with the backing of the majority of the American people . 
By allowing Arizona to pass stricter immigration laws ?

NO , it was NOT a FOX News poll . 
FOX news , that you mindless liberals love to call Faux News , is burying what used to be the main stream media . 
FOX continues to rise in ratings -LRB- even before BO -RRB- while NBC , CNN , ABC , and CBS plummet . 
FOX is now the premier news source of the USA . 
You might want to watch and find out what is REALLY going on . 
FOX presents news , not news they like or dislike , THE NEWS . 
The old , tired , failing , networks are now nothing but advertising agencies for the liberal left . 
THEY no longer KNOW what news is , and THEY ca n't figure out why THEY are failing across the board . 
Watch FOX and you 'll be shocked to find that Bill O'Rielly is as strong an Obama defender as ANYONE in the old media . 
From the beginning of the BHO reign , O'Rielly has constantly said , `` Wait and see . '' 
`` Give FOX a chance . '' 
`` Obama is a very smart man . 
`` On the other hand , Glenn Beck thinks and says BHO is a horror . 
That is presenting 2 sides of a story . 
Throughout the broadcast day FOX has on STAUNCH Democrats and near and far left liberals . 
FAR give FAR a pulpit and let FAR present FAR ideology . 
The lamestream media USED to do that , now FAR do n't . 
On Glenn Beck , , , , , No one in the administration , or on the left has PROVED anything that Beck says to be a lie . 
And BECK challenges FAR all to do so regularly . 
The left CLAIMS BECK 's lying , but not once have FAR been able to say , `` Here is the fact proving Beck was lying . '' 
Beck PROVES the administration is lying on an almost daily basis . 
FOX presents BOTH sides , the rest present the liberal view ONLY . 
FOX prospers , the rest slowly sink . 
Keep calling them Faux News , THEM are laughing at your foolishly closed mind .

CURRENTPOSTID 961
Even though these websites are run by his own personal staff or were set up before HIS even took office . 
Also , how could there be so much criticism of President Obama if OBAMA was n't transparent . 
because they disagree with your budgetary policies ? 
Besides the fact that you 're quoting an opinion blog , you should really read the article . 
FACT says OBAMA programs would push us $ 2.5 trillion dollars deeper into debt by 2020 . 
In 8 years President Bush dropped US $ 10.3 trillion into debt . 
Again , not a comparison . 
HCR was passed through according to what 8 promised at the beginning of 8 campaign . 
You 're claiming 8 's a bad person for sticking to 8 promises . 
If 8 really wanted to block BEGINNING 8 could 've issued a presidential executive order . 
One speech , law 's out . 
HCR followed 'S promises 'S made during 'S campaign . 
Cap and Trade is designed to get us off foreign oil dependency . 
I thought thats what the majority of people wanted 'S never actually pardoned anybody . 
'S threatened too , but never did . 
Yah , YAH is = -RRB- Haha you have trouble distinguishing an independent from a democrat .

He has not been transparent . 
That is why HE gets the criticism . 
The Dems want to spend , spend , spend and tax , tax , tax . 
I disagree with that . 
HCR was not passed , DEMS was shoved through . 
The majority of folks opposed DEMS . 
Link : http:\/\/www.rasmussenreports.com\/publ...th_care_reform He would get too much heat for that . 
That is why HTTP:\/\/WWW.RASMUSSENREPORTS.COM\/PUBL...TH_CARE_REFORM is going through the courts . 
Obamacare is opposed by the majority of Americans . 
Cap & Trade will not reduce our dependency . 
It is only another tax that will hurt companies , consumers , and OUR economy . 
OBAMACARE is still not finished with trying to push through amnesty for illegals . 
What a joke . 
Then you had better start digesting the information because you are coming to false conclusions . 
CURRENTPOSTID 964
And that 's exactly why you know how HCR was `` pushed through '' and all about the new Cap and Trade bill and about Immigration . 
Because THAT government is n't transparent ? 
And that 's your right , do n't discredit a man by calling MAN unamerican because you disagree with MAN . 
RIGHT will dwarf RIGHT ? 
Your blaming President Obama for something that President Bush started . 
And as you 've seen , by your own website , President Obama 's spending plan will greatly minimize the rate of increase of our debt : the first step to decreasing WEBSITE . 
I can not deny , that by your website , most Americans are against WEBSITE . 
Please explain how HCR is pushed through when everybody but the President dislikes DISLIKES .

I find out how this crap is on the table , and how bad CRAP is through the outlets that I watch\/listen to - not Obama or Congress . 
Their goal is to keep us all in the dark and pass this destructive legislation with midnight\/weekend votes . 
Obama is un-American because OBAMA is systematically destroying US Constitution and US liberties . 
Yes , Obama will dwarf Bush 's contributions to US deficit . 
THEIR will be record levels . 
Democrats have no backbone , except the ones that voted against BACKBONE . 
ONES accepted back-door deals from Obama , or were otherwise pressured into voting for BACKBONE . 
ONES were sacrificed for the sake of Obamacare . 
Businesses that have to pay additional if ONES exceed ONES credits , are essentially paying an energy tax . 
ONES will recoup ONES money by passing additional costs to the consumer . 
The price of products and services will go up . 
Our energy consumption will not decrease . 
Cap and Trade : Will CAP Save the Earth ? 
http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=LPPVDOpFCIA CAP will be if the MSM covers MSM . 
Hopefully , you will see the light . 
CURRENTPOSTID 966
And where do your outlets get it from ? 
Oh right , Obama and Congress . 
How else are they to be transparent , you want THEY to walk up to every person 's door and explain every point of THEY policy ? 
The very thing that criticizes THEY , THEY must depend on for being transparent . 
So far you have no proof to this . 
He has offered no change to our Constitution and has n't removed a single liberty . 
The website YOU posted already disproved this fact . 
So HE convinced all the spineless Democrats to vote for Obamacare . 
Yet there were some that voted against OBAMACARE . 
With a need for a majority to pass Obamacare , and a Republican controlled Congress , how exactly was this forced through , with the full weight of R 's against THIS and some D 's as well ? 
Then FAULT is not the President 's fault . 
PRESIDENT has performed a measure that would be effective for decreasing energy consumption and also gain the government some more income . 
FAULT is the companies ' fault for not following the set limit . 
... what ? 
Are you really trying to counter argue with simply saying a news media will report news ? 
That just simply made my head hurt ... MY have , HURT 's quite dark , African American in fact ! 
CURRENTPOSTID 969
It is long because IT has to be . 
We see how the Constitution and Bill of Rights are extensively malleable and dependent on someone 's perception . 
If a bill passes now-a-days , BILL must be watertight to avoid such flexibility , and that makes a bill long . 
As for the loopholes , in any bill , there are compromises . 
With a bill as controversial as this one and enacted right after a very tense and violent campaign , Congressmen are likely to compromise over the bill . 
Also CONGRESSMEN add unneeded amendments and money spending called pork barrel . 
This is done mainly by those who are against the bill in hopes of getting THIS voted down . 
You are generally insulting an entire government , simply because GOVERNMENT opposition put up a fight . 
CURRENTPOSTID 970
Did you know that if you went to the library of Congress you can read every single bill that is currently being voted on ? 
Also you can analyze who put LIBRARY up for vote , where LIBRARY is in the voting process , how many nays and ayes there are currently for CURRENTLY , who wrote CURRENTLY and which party they are , when CURRENTLY was introduced , which companies\/people are backing the bill , which committee the bill is under , who heads that committee , what that persons political stance on the bill is , how much this bill will cost , who will be paying for COMMITTEE , and approximately how long CURRENTLY will be till CURRENTLY takes effect . 
Just because President Obama does n't force Congress to give a daily televised speech on the thousands of bills that pass through CONGRESS , does n't mean that CONGRESS is not becoming more transparent . 
CURRENTPOSTID 971

From inauguration , BO had total control of both the House and Senate . 
The Democrats could pass any bill they wished in a totally partisan manner . 
The Republicans could grumble , but were powerless to stop or even delay , any legislation from day one . 
Yet DAY took BO over a year to pass BO signature Health Care bill . 
And to pass DAY , a number of DEMOCRATS had to be bribed and coerced and promised who knows what as a group of them SUDDENLY decided to vote for the HCR and RETIRE . 
Net result is a bill that only messes up the health care system and will likely forever change health care insurance , and not for the better . 
That is not good Government . 
The PEOPLE said PEOPLE did NOT want that Health Care bill . 
And now The People say PEOPLE want the bill repealed and a real bi-partisan bill worked out . 
BO refused to listen , then and now ! 
The people WILL speak in November and BO will be forced to listen as BO becomes essentially a lame duck halfway through BO ONLY term . 
CURRENTPOSTID 976
Republicans have just as much right in Congress to fillibuster , pork barrel , amend , and debate the hell out of any bill , which is probably what happened to this bill . 
As for bribery and all these other ridiculous claims , has anyone had charges brought against them ?

Anyone confronted with evidence ?

Try this . 
YES voted for President Obama . 
On one hand OBAMA is too liberal for YES , and on the other too conservative . 
OBAMA is too conservative because OBAMA let Wall Street walk all over OBAMA , when YES was expecting OBAMA to kick some corporate ass . 
OBAMA is too liberal for YES because OBAMA sent the Attorney General to Arizona to sue and stop the Arizona immigration law . 
The border is out of control , and Obama should be trying to work with Governor Jan Brewer to clean up the criminal illegal alien and anchor baby mess . 
OBAMA did get health care passed which was a major issue for YES . 
Will YES vote for President Obama again ? 
YES answered `` yes , '' because YES believe Obama\/Biden will see the light with the help of American labor when OBAMA\/BIDEN comes to the issue of illegals . 
If OBAMA does not , YES may shop around . 
Under no circumstances will YES vote for Sarah Palin for political office . 
She is simply incompetent . 
Some YES know are talking of not voting at all . 
YES used to think that was wrong .

They were supposed to televise all the HCR debates on C-SPAN and post the bills with sufficient time for the American People to see THEY . 
THEY did not do this . 
THEY finally started to post some items , but with only a few days til voting . 
Not enough time . 
VOTING 's a work in progress . 
HCR is one example . 
He has appointed two judges to the Supreme Court who can not uphold the Constitution , and will legislate from the bench . 
You 're misreading TWO apparently then . 
Quit looking at TWO upside down . 
You apparently did n't watch the video . 
You lost me on this one . 
CURRENTPOSTID 979
The most that the Executive branch can do is open the court doors to the media , they can not force THEY to come and people to watch . 
In fact much of the time FACT WAS televised on C-Span but THEY promised live coverage and votes were being done at unreasonable hours . 
I believe he promised w \/ in 5 days , aka a few days . 
And you 're saying it is n't THEY right to do so ? 
I 'm confused , you seem to believe that the President has enormous legislative power , and yet the judicial branch has none . 
I did more than look at the graph , I read the referenced article and hmm : '' -LRB- Raise -RRB- the publicly held national debt to over $ 18 trillion . '' 
GRAPH was at $ 10.3 trillion dollars when handed over to PRESIDENT ... seems that PRESIDENT clocks in at $ 8 trillion , significantly less than our warmongering previous leader . 
As of 2010 you 're quite right . 
But what of PRESIDENT first two years ? 
You are quite right , I did not . 
I refuse to let somebody let something else debate for them . 
If you wish to quote the video and reference VIDEO , fine . 
I was arguing that the President had given up on PRESIDENT attempts , and backed VIDEO up by saying it was so high profile VIDEO would still be in the news if PRESIDENT were still trying . 
And you said yes YES would be if MSM covered YES ... ? 
CURRENTPOSTID 980
Whatever . 
Obama was less than sincere on OBAMA promise to be transparent . 
Obama apparently has a lot of influence on OBAMA herd of sheep in Congress . 
The SCOTUS is supposed to interpret the law and abide by our Constitution . 
They can not legislate nor re-write the Constitution in THEY actions . 
Where do you come up with $ 10.3 trillion for Bush ? 
Article from 2009 : http:\/\/content.usatoday.com\/communit...10\/620000005\/1Another: http:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/8301-503544_1...97-503544.html Both Houses of Congress have been under Dem control since Obama took office . 
ARTICLE 's informative . 
You can learn from ARTICLE . 
However , in a nutshell : Cap & Trade = Massive Energy Tax . 
Article : http:\/\/online.wsj.com\/article\/SB123655590609066021.html He is still pushing for Cap & Trade . 
ARTICLE just has another name nowadays : American Power Act . 
CURRENTPOSTID 981
And yet he 's fulfilled it . 
The ruling of the Supreme Court has the same weight as our written Constitution , and under activist judges , the Supreme court has seen fit to interpret laws in quite a liberal fashion . 
These interpretations include Roe v Wade with the creation of the law that a women has a right to control her own body , and Gibbons v Ogden and the widening of the meaning of `` interstate commerce '' to mean pretty much anything that passed between states , including people . 
http:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/8301-500803_1...28-500803.html&quot;In fact WADE was just two months ago , on July 30 , that President Bush signed the Housing and Economic Recovery Act , which contained a provision raising the debt ceiling to $ 10.615 trillion `` Sorry , ROE underestimated . 
This website also shows that the bailout was legislation started and pushed through by Bush , not Obama Actually in the 2007 - 09 years , there was an equal Senate with two Libertarians , effectively a Republican controlled Senate . 
Mind you this was the year that HCR passed . 
So let ROE get this straight . 
Cap and Trade is a limit put on companies and if those companies exceed those limits that have to pay a fee . 
CAP is not a tax . 
Too bad we were n't talking about that .

Not technically a tax .

That extra cost will be reflected in higher prices we all , including the poorest among us , will get to pay . 
And there is no possible argument that the increased cost will not be passed on to the consumers -LRB- US ! -RRB- 
ORCompanies will go to an energy exchange company , like CCX , and TRADE carbon credits after ORCOMPANIES have exceeded ORCOMPANIES CAP . 
CCX stands to make Billions off a CAP & TRADE law .

Far from it . 
You 're delusional on this one .

Bush certainly had BUSH spending problems , no doubt , but Obama is going to town on spending - Vegas style . 
The Senate was not controlled by the Republicans . 
The House was controlled by the Dems . 
The House essentially passed the bill with HOUSE Democratic majority . 
The Senate just had to vote on a reconciliatory package , where they only needed 51 votes . 
Call SENATE what you want . 
SENATE 's a tax , and SENATE will hit us all as THEY pass the extra costs to the consumer .

I ca n't quote all your statements since you posted it kinda weird but I 'll do I best . 
President Bush was also notorious for keeping the Iraq War off the books , which kept the numbers lower . 
And yes I can , Bush increased NOTORIOUS 71.9 % over FOUR years , this report was only on BUSH second term , considering we actually had a surplus after Clinton . 
Obama has increased NOTORIOUS a little under 40 % in two years , so a little over Bush , I mistake .

Well that debate was effectively ended . 
By interpreting the Constitution , they essentially change CONSTITUTION . 
THEY can change the meanings of the laws . 
CONSTITUTION called an activist court . 
And yet most of the debt currently attributed to Obama , came from Bush 's stimulus package . 
`` By 2020 , the annual deficit as a percentage of GDP will be 5.6 % , according to the CBO . 
The White House estimates HOUSE will be 4.2 % . 
`` If you read farther into the article YOU would notice that ARTICLE shows when Obama was confronted with the projections YOU mentioned OBAMA : `` has created a fiscal advisory commission to recommend ways lawmakers can get annual deficits down to 3 % of GDP by 2015 . '' 
http:\/\/www.infoplease.com\/ipa\/A0774721.htmlOkay how a bill works is this , both chambers vote on an identical versions of a bill , YOU each make YOU own amendments and changes and then YOU switch , and each chamber changes the other version . 
If , at the end , the two versions are n't the same , YOU get called into a conference where a unanimous vote is needed to get VOTE passed . 
Also , a majority vote is needed to make any changes . 
So while the Dems may have had control in the House , YOU would need control in the Senate to `` push the bill through '' without a good amount of help from the Repubs . 
Not to mention the fact that , as you claimed , many Dems voted against FEE . 
FEE 's not a tax . 
FEE 's a fee under circumstances . 
A tax is forced , a fee is optional . 
Yes , Cap and Trade is exactly the same as amnesty for Immigrants . 
CURRENTPOSTID 996
Yes , with the conclusion that Obama has n't been very transparent . 
OBAMA is only being forced to be more transparent now from pressure to do so , but OBAMA certainly was n't in the first 18 months of OBAMA Presidency . 
Interpreting the Constitution does NOT imply changing the Constitution . 
The SCOTUS is NOT supposed to be activist . 
They are the Judicial Branch , not the Legislative Branch . 
You are talking about `` annual deficit '' numbers . 
The `` national debt '' is still projected to be 90 % of GDP by 2020 . 
The 111th Congress voted on HCR . 
There were 57 Democratic Senators . 
All SENATORS needed was 51 votes for reconciliation . 
If SENATORS exceed SENATORS caps , SENATORS will be subject to the fees , which are mandatory at that point , not optional . 
It is essentially a tax on over-production that will be passed on to the consumer via goods and services . 
Apparently , we were not on the same page with this one .

CURRENTPOSTID 998
From the same article : The CBO cited two big contributors to the jump in debt . 
One is the president 's proposal to extend the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts for the majority of Americans . 
The other is the proposal to protect middle - and upper-middle-income families from having to pay the Alternative Minimum Tax -LRB- AMT -RRB- . 
Together those proposals would cost $ 3 trillion between 2011 and 2020 . 
The biggest causes for the projected increase in deficits are maintaining tax cuts . 
In spite of his promise , Obama should follow Clinton 's proposal and just repeal the Bush tax cuts in FAMILIES entirety . 
Or HIS has to compensate for keeping a portion of FAMILIES with higher taxes on the wealthy .

On immigration , 1.5 ignores the many cities VIOLATING Federal law , AND SUES THE STATE OF AZ . 
that is attempting to assist the Feds , as Federal law suggests .

That is a pretty nonsensical point of view . 
If Obama adopted those measures , especially the ones about deporting people and economic regression that would come about from stopping free trade , I would sooner vote for I dog as a write in than Obama under those circumstances . 
I also like the fact that right wingers constantly blather on about the free market . 
And yet in action , and even specific policy rhetoric WINGERS oppose the free market at every turn . 
Opposition to free trade , is opposition to the free market . 
Opposition to the free movement of labor is opposition to the free market . 
That is why I can not stomach the hypocritical right wing stupidity . 
They claim to support a free market , and yet THEY oppose the free market all THEY time . 
THEY claim to be in favor of freedom , but THEY oppose freedom all the time . 
The reality is , the right wing agenda can be summed up as , `` I want a free market for I , I do n't care about anyone else . 
And I want freedom for I , I do n't care about anyone else .

SHE did n't say `` SHE can see russia from SHE house '' SHE said something along the lines of this interaction . 
Interviewer -LRB- who PALIN think was Charlie Gibson -RRB- : What do you say to people that say you do n't have enough experience or knowledge of foreign policy issues ? 
`` Palin : `` Well PALIN know there Charlie , INTERVIEWER have been governor of Alaska and PALIN can see Russia from Alaska . 
That gives INTERVIEWER foreign policy experience . 
`` That is a horrendously idiotic statement . 
ALASKA is just as stupid as saying PALIN can see Russia from PALIN house . 
ALASKA conveys the exact same message . 
SNL just added the house part for a bit of comedic effect . 
PALIN ca n't see the significant difference . 
Maybe you can explain to PALIN why it is ok to say YOU have foreign policy experience because YOU can see Russia from a part of YOU state YOU have never been to , but it is somehow silly to say the same thing about seeing THING from YOU house . 
RUSSIA is exactly the same , and if one is stupider , it is the one Palin said . 
At least if she could actually see Russia from SHE house , RUSSIA might be some form of strange logic . 
Instead SHE can not see Russia , has never seen Russia , and SHE claims that Russia 's proximity to Alaska somehow give SHE foreign policy experience just seem even stupider .

Reagan 's policies led to rapid private sector expansion , followed by rapid private sector collapse . 
So we can either follow Reagan 's model and get those years like 84-85 and have 5 % growth , which will then be followed by 10 % loss . 
Or WE can follow the post WWII Keynsian model that saw the longest period of uninterrupted global expansion in human history . 
Maybe WE never saw one or 2 years of massive growth , but WE never saw rapid declines either . 
If YEARS was n't for the massive deregulation campaign undertaken between 1981 and 2008 , WE would not be in the recession WE are now in . 
There can of course be over regulation , and if that occurs some deregulation makes sense .

In what way was he a liberal ? 
What sort of revisionism is this ? 
Bush was a terrible president , so now we have right wing liars trying to say LIBERAL was liberal ?? 
I suppose there a few issues you could say LIBERAL was liberal about , immigration for example . 
But you could also spin that and say LIBERAL supported the free market , and supported the free movement of labor , so LIBERAL did n't want to intervene with the market . 
Which is what strict labor immigration control is . 
What else was Bush Liberal about ? 
LIBERAL spent a lot !! 
But that is a conservative trait in the modern world not a liberal one . 
The last 3 Republican president we had spent like lunatics . 
Reagan , Bush , and Bush . 
Clinton balanced the budget . 
No liberal would ever advocate for years of insane deficit spending , which is something only the right wing has ever done in this countries history other than the WWII era . 
What else could even remotely be twisted into a liberal stance ? 
Bush cut taxes . 
Deregulated . 
Opposed social freedoms . 
Opposed abortion . 
All those things are conservative .

Ah you mean the whole spreading democracy throughout the world . 
Well that was old school American liberalism for sure . 
The thing is though , that has been the policy of both Republican and Democratic presidents since the start of the cold war . 
Pre-WWII I would agree the conservative position tended to be isolationist and the liberal tended to have more expansive and optimistic foreign policy goals . 
That has n't been true very often since that point . 
And POINT absolutely has n't been true at least since the 70sI think your problem is , you seem to be confusing libertarianism with conservatism . 
Even that last link you gave said Bush was conservative , BUSH just believed in some liberal policies . 
The truth is BUSH is a Reagan style conservative . 
Insane spending . 
Belief in using foreign policy to promote and spread democracy .

But the Dems passed the 1993 tax increase that flooded the Treasury with revenues which gave us the surplus budget , and the deficit was falling rapidly in those two years before the Republicans got control . 
Furthermore , US saw once Bush got into office that the Republican congress was n't exactly thrifty when CONGRESS comes to spending .

Yes , but it is commonly referred to as the 1994 takeover which is when the election was .

Not in my experience . 
You 're not the first who incorrectly stated the Republicans took over in 1994 . 
And the Republicans will retain congress in 2002 and McCain will win the election in 2004 .

CURRENTPOSTID 1074
Fair enough , people can say that to refer to the election . 
I think we 've got the record straight PEOPLE did n't take actual control of Congress until 1995 , after the deficit had been declining rapidly for two years . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1075
The election was in 1994 but they did n't get into office until 1995 . 
Just like Bush had control of the white house when the 2009 deficit was predicted to be a staggering 1.2 trillion dollars even before we knew the full extent of the financial crash .

Get with the program . 
OBAMA has a lot more skills than that Bozo WE had before or McSame that was trying to take OBAMA place . 
I believe your vision is blinded by your ideology and you are not able to see that . 
No , that Reps\/cons did n't want . 
What ? 
That is what Boehner and the rest of the GOP who have REPS\/CONS head up so far into REPS\/CONS butts REPS\/CONS ca n't see that Wall Street is taking us to the cleaners , and does n't care because REPS\/CONS are in Wall Street 's pocket . 
Bwahahah ! 
That is why so many Rep Congressmen were so eager to take the money and take photo ops admitting MONEY was creating jobs . 
Your rhetoric reeks of right-wing anger , jealousy and erronious crap . 
The buffoon US had before made us the laughing stock of the world , thank God for an eloquent speaker US are no longer the butt of jokes . 
Some more Faux News type lies . 
Reps\/cons are so ignorant REPS\/CONS wanted Obama to plug the hole . 
Obama handled the crisis much more intelligently than dumb Bush handled Katrina . 
More lies . 
Post some facts if you want to be credible instead of repeating the rethoric you hear on Fixed Noise . 
Self-serving Reps\/cons would like the moratorium lifted , and if another spill occurs , they can whine and blame Obama for not taking action and declaring a moratorium . 
We 're talking about Bush\/Cheney , no ? 
I agree . 
It was the Justice Dept that did the suing , but ignorant cons do n't realize that . 
And , DOJ is just keeping with the Constitution , something that Reps\/cons do n't seem to understand . 
REPS\/CONS claim REPS\/CONS love the Constitution but do n't mind shredding CONSTITUTION or letting REPS\/CONS leaders -LRB- Bush\/Cheney -RRB- shred CONSTITUTION . 
Selfish reps do n't have any empathy for those that lost REPS jobs , REPS are just interested in helping BP and other corporations keep CORPORATIONS millions so CORPORATIONS can pay CORPORATIONS CEO 's big bonuses . 
And BP would all be considered BS .

Certainly not . 
But anyone who was even semi-conscious between 2001 and 2009 must understand how disastrous Republican control is . 
Maybe one day people , when PEOPLE realize Democrats suck , will not then turn to Republicans only to realize PEOPLE also suck , just to turn back to Democrats . 
Maybe one day people will wake up and break that cycle .

Conservatism in it 's basic definition is a political ideology that is against new programs . 
Everyone in the republican party is in general against new government programs . 
Therefore they all fit under the conservative ideology . 
There are multiple subfactions of conservatism . 
Including libertarians . 
But the neo cons of the republican party are no less conservative than the libertarians . 
I am not wrong . 
I just do n't have a political agenda to redefine conservativism to separate REPUBLICAN from the neo cons and George W. Bush . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1099
For the sake of argument I will not correct your flawed definition and statements but accept them to make a point . 
Following your own logic , and absolute unwillingness to admit you are wrong , then all Democrats are Communists . 
It is n't much of a secret that COMMUNISTS are , but I 'd really like to see you type SECRET , or agree with TYPE . 
Then again , reading you attempt to squirm your way around this , is sufficiently entertaining . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1100

That is how bad B.O. 's star has fallen . 
Some Democrats and even some liberal Democrats are looking at the idea of dumping REPUBLICAN . 
Radical RIGHT wing pollsters do n't show B.O. 's numbers to be a lot worse than the neutral companies , POLLSTERS do n't have to .

If a Republican does n't like guns , REPUBLICAN doesn t buy one . 
If a Democrat does n't like guns , DEMOCRAT wants all guns outlawed . 
If a Republican is a vegetarian , REPUBLICAN doesn t eat meat . 
If a Democrat is a vegetarian , DEMOCRAT wants all meat products banned for everyone . 
If a Republican is homosexual , REPUBLICAN quietly leads REPUBLICAN life . 
If a Democrat is homosexual , DEMOCRAT demands legislated respect . 
If a Republican is down-and-out , REPUBLICAN thinks about how to better REPUBLICAN situation . 
A Democrat wonders who is going to take care of DEMOCRAT . 
If a Republican does n't like a talk show host , REPUBLICAN switches channels . 
Democrats demand that those DEMOCRATS do n't like be shut down . 
If a Republican is a non-believer , REPUBLICAN does n't go to church . 
A Democrat non-believer wants any mention of God and religion silenced . 
If a Republican decides REPUBLICAN needs health care , REPUBLICAN goes about shopping for CARE , or may choose a job that provides CARE . 
A Democrat demands that the rest of us pay for DEMOCRAT . 
If a Republican reads this , REPUBLICAN 'll forward THIS so REPUBLICAN friends can have a good laugh .

I 'm not entirely sure you know what the term means . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1136
Thanks . 
I understood your assertion perfectly the first time . 
Let I make I position a bit simpler , if I can . 
A `` racist , '' by definition , is one who discriminates or is prejudiced against others or villifies OTHERS based on OTHERS race . 
Now , if a liberal -LRB- or anyone else -RRB- calls someone a `` racist '' based not on the person 's race , but on OTHERS own inability to conduct and intelligent argument , then the liberal is not discriminating or being prejudiced against that person based on race , but based on ignorance , right ? 
So by definition , that does not indicate OTHERS are racist at all , does DEFINITION ? 
Now , what were WHAT saying about being able to conduct an intelligent argument ? 
In the meantime , the rest of us will just savor the delicious irony of you calling liberals the most racist for calling others racists when being unable to conduct an intelligent argument . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1137
As a liberal , you naturally want to define racist in the narrowest terms possible . 
However , in reality , -LRB- a term foreign to liberals -RRB- playing the race card against all and any at every opportunity is RACIST , whether you wish to acknowledge that or not . 
IE calling the AZ law RACIST when REALITY is not , IS RACIST . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1138
A wise man once said : `` Racism is simply an ugly form of collectivism , the mindset that views humans only as members of groups and never as individuals . 
Racists believe that all individual who share superficial physical characteristics are alike ; as collectivists , racists think only in terms of groups . 
By encouraging Americans to adopt a group mentality , the advocates of so-called `` diversity '' actually perpetuate racism . 
ADVOCATES intense focus on race is inherently racist , because FOCUS views individuals only as members of racial groups . 
Conservatives and libertarians should fight back and challenge the myth that collectivist liberals care more about racism . 
Modern liberalism , however well intentioned , is a byproduct of the same collectivist thinking that characterizes racism . 
The continued insistence on group thinking only inflames racial tensions . ''

That ought to be the strategy for every political and ethical individual that hopes to eliminate such unfounded inequality . 
That may just be I opinion . 
Also I will say in regard to Dan40 , that calling a law racist , does n't make someone racist , DAN40 makes SOME ignorant of what racist means . 
A document can not be racist . 
DOCUMENT can be written by a racist , and DOCUMENT can defend racist actions , but the document DOCUMENT can not be racist . 
Personally I do n't like the Arizona law , as big a states rights guy as I am , the constitution gives the power to regulate national borders to the Federal Government . 
If the states want to devote resources to help in that endeavor that is their right , but to make laws in that respect appears to be unconstitutional . 
I 'll have to look into ENDEAVOR a bit more though . 
If arizona wants to pass such a law , then we need a 28th amendment .

Every few years or so , that agency changes its formula to make the numbers look a little sweeter . 
They also neglect to revaluate previous satistics , but post SATISTICS together all the same . 
Here is an elementary example : before -- there were 7 yellow people and 3 green ppl unemployed equaling 10 &#37; of the populationnow -- there are 10 yellow people and 10 green ppl equaling 20 % of the populationBefore for instance , PEOPLE counted yellow and greens in unemployment . 
So in this mock example 10 % of people are unemployed . 
Now PEOPLE stoped counting green people . 
so NOW looks like only 10 % unemployment . 
Therefore as far as we know , there has been little change . 
In real terms the government says WE have 10 % unemployment and 2 % inflation . 
In terms WE used from the very beginning -LRB- before -RRB- or unmanipulated ... WE actually have 22 % unemployment and 6 % inflation ... So yes , the Bureau of labor satistics is kind of bull .

And the result of all that expensive BLS effort is that if a person 's benefits have expired and they have given up trying to find a job . 
According to the BLS THEY are NO LONGER UNEMPLOYED . 
The unemployment rate dropped from 9.7 to 9.5 a couple of months ago , NOT because people had found work , but because the BLS SAID 652,000 , formerly unemployed , PEOPLE HAD , `` LEFT THE LABOR FORCE ! 
`` PEOPLE choose to believe the Democrat\/liberal Pols and disbelieve the Republican\/conservative Pols . 
The operative word is UNEMPLOYED are Pols. , UNEMPLOYED both LIE !!!! 
We NEED part-time , non-career legislators , not power mad politicians .

Seems to me Reps flip-flop on what they want . 
Not to long ago Palin and McCain were both for cap and trade , now THEY are against CAP ! 
Is that the same with you ? 
If McCain had won , you 'd be all for SAME , right ? 
Sarah Palin 's Flip-Flop on Cap-and-TradePOSTED BY CLOE ON JULY 20 , 2009 AT 08:01 PMSince Sarah Palin announced that she d be resigning SHE post as Alaska s governor -LRB- 16 month early -RRB- a couple of weeks ago , ON s made FLIP-FLOP clear that ON plans to spend more time traveling around the lower 48 states . 
True to task , on Tuesday Palin had an oped in the Washington Post articulating AN opposition to President Obama s energy plan which includes a cap-and-trade program that would allow industrial sources to buy and sell pollution permits . 
But TUESDAY looks like AN s a little unclear on what AN policy positions are . 
During the campaign , McCain-Palin campaign literature -LRB- check CAMPAIGN out below -RRB- and the candidate AN -LRB- see the video -RRB- sang a totally different tune . 
THEN : They -LRB- McCain-Palin -RRB- have proposed a cap-and-trade system that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions while encouraging the development of low-cost compliance options . 
A climate cap-and-trade mechanism would set a limit on greenhouse gas emissions and allow entities to buy and sell rights to emit , similar to the successful acid rain trading program of the early 1990s . 
The key feature of this mechanism is that FEATURE allows the market to decide and encourage the lowest-cost compliance options . 
NOW : Palin wants to responsibly tap the resources that God created right underfoot on American soil and drill in the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge .

What you liberals interpret as `` extremes '' are everyone that does not share your beautiful and fine sounding but impossible Utopian dreams . 
`` Everything for Everybody , '' would be the end result for all liberals . 
Well certainly RESULT would be wonderful if everyone was free from want and need and WORK . 
But that is not only impossible , RESULT is impossible in the `` extreme . 
`` And the Tea Party IS the American Silent Majority finding RESULT voice . 
Libs . 
ca n't understand that and reject that simple TRUTH . 
IS the ` tea party ' a mixed bag ? 
Certainly AMERICA is , AMERICA AMERICA . 
Standing up for actual VALUES instead of ` dreaming impossible dreams . 
`` Should libs FEAR the Silent Majority ? 
Oh very YES . 
Not for violence , but because YES means the end of liberalism and progressiveness . 
And will re-establish the idea of rewards for hard work and accomplishment instead of rewarding mediocrity and abject whining . 
Out of touch with reality ? 
Missouri voted 71 &#37; against obummercare . 
Gibbs said , to paraphrase , `` doan mean nuttin . '' 
That was what was said in Vietnam to avoid reality . 
Reid said . 
The more people learn about the health care bill , the better PEOPLE like BILL . 
That is BOTH untrue and out of touch with reality . 
So Gibbs and Reid are both out of touch with reality or both intentional liars . 
And most likely BOTH are Both . 
And Gallup , not FOX , not Rasmussen , now has obummer 's approval at 41 % for vs 57 % AGAINST .

Are you going to tell me there is something wrong with tax money going to people who need the assistance ? 
Especially in a bad recession ? 
Because every economist agrees that the best way to get out of a recession fast -LRB- especially in this one where consumer demand is low -RRB- is to shift wealth to the poor as fast as possible to get money flowing again . 
The only people who are foolish are those who believe otherwise . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1200
What a bunch of BS . 
You 'll have to prove that one .

I would think the proof would be in the fact that largest economic crash since the great depression -LRB- and probably even larger than that -RRB- was quickly ended less than a year after the stimulus bill . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1202
Giving unearned money to the poor and to people hurt by the recession are two different things . 
People who are down on POOR luck , out of a job , due to no fault of POOR own deserve help . 
People who are lazy and do not try to look for work are a whole different story . 
Just saying give the money to the poor will stimulate the economy is incorrect . 
How many of the lazy will spend that money on drugs ? 
Want to spend some money on the lazy ? 
Take this old proverb into reality , instead of giving a man food a fish to eat each day , teach him to fish and HIM can provide for HIM for ever . 
-LRB- maybe not exact , but WE should get the point -RRB- If we just continually give , people have initiative to become an asset to this Country . 
Curious ? 
If BO just gave all 110 million taxpayers an equal cut of the Trillions BO has spent in the last 19 months , how much would everyone have to invest into the economy , that makes a lot more sense than than re-distributing the wealth to non-supporters of of our CountryBack to the OP , I would not vote for BO in a million years ... .

Fortunately this is not the case for most people on welfare or food stamps . 
70 % of those who get on welfare return to work eventually . 
And the average time off work for those on welfare is only 3 years . 
The combination of welfare and foodstamps the average recipient recieves is not enough to put yourself above the poverty line . 
Most people if given a choice are not going to want to continue living like that . 
And those that do decide to are often taken off such programs like unemployment benefits . 
Laziness is not a problem with the poor and middle class . 
Most poor are extremely hard working people who have not been given the proper tools and education to succeed . 
AMOUNT 's not an exorbident amount of money we 're giving PEOPLE . 
WE 're giving PEOPLE enough for food . 
WE 're giving PEOPLE enough to support a family at bare minimum needs . 
And in some cases WE 're giving PEOPLE a job . 
As I said before . 
Most people who get on welfare want nothing more than to get off . 
STYLE 's a below the poverty line life style and STYLE 's no way to raise a family or even live on your own . 
No that would n't make more sense because there are people that do not need the extra money and would just put STYLE in PEOPLE rainy day fund . 
The big corporate leaders are n't going to use that money to hire more people since demand is so low NO does n't warrant hiring more people .

My post was in re : your wholehearted endorsement of Communism . 
Evidently Liberalism is now Communism for those that can not spell Communism . 
The philosophies are the same . 
TAKE from those who have , Give to those who have not earned . 
As far as your post above and FAR attempt to change the subject . 
Those that can see the extremely obvious FACT that B.O. 's policies have NOT recovered the economy even enough for REAL job creation to keep up with population growth . 
Are not foolish . 
Unemployment claims are up again . 
There was a little drop for a few weeks but now DROP on the rise again . 
AND the BLS once again said that the rate maintained at 9.5 % because ANOTHER 187,000 formerly unemployed , exhausted UNEMPLOYED benefits and DROPPED OUT of the labor market . 
Not MY words , or RNC 's words or Rush 's words , this comes straight from the BLS . 
Is the economy better ? 
Yes ECONOMY is very MARGINALLY better . 
obummer and the Stimulus ? 
No , could be any reason for the minuscule improvement . 
And trying to claim that NO `` enlightened '' policies resulted in an all but invisible improvement IS FOOLISH . 
Wonder if Roemer , ROEMER main economic adviser QUIT or was FIRED this week . 
A really intelligent person in charge would NOT be trying to take credit for such little results of MASSIVE spending . 
Give obummer credit for all the jobs PERSON CLAIMS to have `` Created '' and WONDER works out to over Half a MILLION Dollars per job . 
At that rate , a ROBUST economy will cost us Quadrillions , not Trillions . 
Great economy , impoverished country . 
Not a gain .

I think there 's a difference , mainly in scale . 
Even Adam Smith advocated `` redistributing wealth '' in the form of a progressive tax structure . 
Our federal tax bracket is the lowest BRACKET 's been in decades . 
The main idea behind Communism , in theory , was to provide total economic equality because of the huge amount of inequality that Marx witnessed . 
The only way to do that in an existing system of government is to not tax the lower classes and tax the upper class 100 % , caps on income , etc. . 
I do n't see anything like that coming from the Obama administration . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1207
Your inability to see the obvious is not the subject . 
Economic Equality is an oxymoron . 
Some have the ability to become wealthy , some do not . 
We have equality of opportunity . 
All have the opportunity to make the attempt at wealth . 
Wealth CAN NOT be given to those that have not and can not earn CAN . 
Money can be given to THOSE and Trillions have been . 
THOSE waste CAN one way or another . 
The more you take from the wealthy , the more you damage everyone , including the poor . 
NO wealthy person has WEALTHY stack of money locked in a vault . 
The money is always in action in the economy . 
Invigorating the economy and creating jobs , NOT sitting and shrinking from inflation . 
That IS the only way ECONOMY can grow . 
And that benefits the poor MORE than giving them dollars to be wasted . 
BHO has the incredible blessing of historical timing . 
BHO has done NOTHING of note with BHO life before or after being elected to political office , including the present position . 
A was a do nothing state rep. A do nothing Federal Senator , and now a do nothing -LRB- good -RRB- president . 
But A came from nowhere in 2008 in a political vacuum . 
And now timing blesses A again with unusually low inflation . 
Notice that no lib . 
is blaming Bush for that . 
Inflation is very low , artificially low . 
If we were running even normal inflation rates , calls for impeachment would already have been heard . 
BO 's failed economic policy does not show up as bad as they are , due to very low inflation . 
BHO has had more political luck and blessing than any politician in the last 100 years . 
BHO has no skills for governing , just luck .

Yeah like Clinton 's mythical Budget surplus that every Democrat never fails to mention . 
What they do not mention is that Clinton COOPERATED with a Republican Congress to come close to balancing the budget . 
And that in no fiscal year of Clinton 's Presidency did the national debt come down . 
THAT went up every year ! 
Altho in small amounts that we would love to have today . 
But spending was NEVER so controlled that the interest on the debt did not cause the debt to increase . 
Interest IS part of the problem and must be counted same as reckless spending .

Generally government loans are cheaper rates because they are partially paid for by tax payers . 
YOU consider YOU family middle class . 
YOU parents make about 40-50k a year . 
YOU got tons of subsidized loans . 
YOU think you 'd be surprised . 
All 4 of YOU room mates are on food stamps . 
Many members of YOU apartment complex YOU 've spoken to are on food stamps . 
And quite a few of YOU friends are as well . 
And YOU 've been nudging a few people to get food stamps as well . 
COMPLEX just makes things easier . 
Even you ... with 2 jobs ... could qualify for food stamps . 
If you make less than 1000 a month then chances are you qualify for the full benefit of $ 200 a month . 
Which is more than enough to eat and eat healthy . 
YOU highly suggest you take the opportunity to sign up . 
Think of OPPORTUNITY as taking some of your tax money back .

CURRENTPOSTID 1250
It is amazing that you know SO little about the United States that you could type the above and believe ANY of TYPE is a good thing . 
A true American that understands how America MUST function KNOWS that one must try to fix themselves AND try to help THEMSELVES country , NOT the other way around . 
Your way MUST FAIL . 
Thr right way was clearly stated by a Democrat . 
JFK . 
JFK said , `` Ask NOT what your country can do for YOUR , ASK what YOUR can do for YOUR country ! 
`` Instead of recommending others to ALSO become freeloaders , LOSER should be condemning the idea of taking anything from the Government unless LOSER need is dire . 
And needing ANOTHER color TV and a high speed Internet connection are NOT dire needs for any person on the planet . 
Not one . 
The country and the economy are only benefited when each of us contribute . 
2 people spending one person 's money DOES NOT put a single penny more into the economy . 
It just means the hard worker has less and the freeloader has more . 
When JFK went to college JFK was married , had 2 baby sons , worked a full time job , and carried a full load of credits , and still found time to do a Friday beer night with frat brothers twice a month . 
Where that energy came from JFK do n't remember -LRB- wish JFK had ENERGY now -RRB- . 
Grades were good , not spectacular but good . 
No food stamps , no welfare , no help from anywhere including our parents . 
Who would have been happy to help , but what OUR were doing was what OUR chose to do and if OUR could not do HELP on OUR own , HELP was on OUR . 
JFK would have been ASHAMED to even think about any Government money . 
Taking Government money means that LOSER are a loser and a parasite on society .

wikipediaIn economics , a recession is a business cycle contraction , a general slowdown in economic activity over a period of time . 
-LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- 2 -RRB- During recessions , many macroeconomic indicators vary in a similar way . 
Production as measured by Gross Domestic Product -LRB- GDP -RRB- , employment , investment spending , capacity utilization , household incomes , business profits and inflation all fall during recessions ; while bankruptcies and the unemployment rate rise . 
Recessions are generally believed to be caused by a widespread drop in spending . 
Governments usually respond to recessions by adopting expansionary macroeconomic policies , such as increasing money supply , increasing government spending and decreasing taxation . 
and DOWNTURN could be truthfully argued that we 're in a depression : wikipediaDepressionIn economics , a depression is a sustained , long-term downturn in economic activity in one or more economies . 
DOWNTURN is a more severe downturn than a recession , which is seen by economists as part of a normal business cycle . 
Considered a rare and extreme form of recession , a depression is characterized by FORM length , and by abnormally large increases in unemployment , falls in the availability of credit quite often due to some kind of banking\/financial crisis , shrinking output and investment , numerous bankruptcies including sovereign debt defaults , significantly reduced amounts of trade and commerce especially international , as well as highly volatile relative currency value fluctuations most often due to devaluations . 
Price deflation , financial crises and bank failures are also common elements of a depression . 
Of course the government will tell you that everything is great and we 're doing just fine and indicators show that WE 're pulling out of GOVERNMENT and all of our measures have worked and ... blah blah ... etc. . 
. 
lies ... etc. . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1253
Wikipedia is not a good source . 
The definition of recession is 2 consecutive quarters of economic decline . 
We 've been experiencing economic growth . 
And everything is n't fine and the government is n't claiming that . 
WE are in the very early stages of a recovery and facing the possibility of a double dip recession . 
No one is claiming WE are in a good position . 
But WE are n't by any means in a recession . 
The recession ended officially early this year .

CURRENTPOSTID 1256
You 've got it all wrong . 
It is good that you work hard , and you should expect the government to recognize that , instead of taking your money and giving MONEY to the very wealthy , those who do n't work at all . 
GOVERNMENT is known as corporate welfare , and the amount of welfare spent on the poor is a drop in the bucket compared to the amount spent on the wealthy . 
Yet the GOP has convinced GOP members that poor people suck all the money out of the government . 
Corporate welfare-the enormous and myriad subsidies , bailouts , giveaways , tax loopholes , debt revocations , loan guarantees , discounted insurance and other benefits conferred by government on business-is a function of political corruption . 
Corporate welfare programs siphon funds from appropriate public investments , subsidize companies ripping minerals from federal lands , enable pharmaceutical companies to gouge consumers , perpetuate anti-competitive oligopolistic markets , injure our national security , and weaken OUR democracy . 
At a time when the national GDP is soaring , one in five children lives in deep poverty , one might expect that a public effort to curtail welfare would focus on cutting big handouts to rich corporations , not small supports for poor individuals . 
But somehow the invocations of the need for stand-on-your-own-two-feet responsibility do not apply to large corporations . 
At a time when even growing federal budget surpluses do not persuade OUR nation 's political leaders to devote public resources to repairing and enhancing the built elements of OUR commonwealth-such as the nation 's schools , bridges , clinics , roads , drinking water systems , courthouses , public transportation systems , and water treatment facilities-one might expect to see calls to divert taxpayer monies from flowing into private corporate hands and instead direct LEADERS to crying public needs . 
But somehow the cramped federal budget-as well as similarly situated state and local budgets-always has room for another corporate welfare program . 
http:\/\/www.thirdworldtraveler.com\/Na...are_Nader.html Lots of people are lazy . 
Even some that work and claim PEOPLE work hard . 
Too assume that all people that do n't work are lazy is just plain ignorance . 
We are all aware of the economic crisis WE have been in and how many people lost SOME jobs . 
Many are trying really hard to get jobs , and some of MANY are reps and cons and some are dems . 
The recession does n't play favorites . 
But to ignore the poor people while allowing corporations -LRB- who pay PEOPLE CEO 's big bonuses -RRB- , to continue and take advantage of Americans is just plain wrong .

Whoever sits in the oval office signs or does n't sign the laws that Congress -LRB- The Lawmaking Body -RRB- passes . 
If the President will not sign a bill , Congress has the power to pass BILL anyway if they get enough members to vote to override a veto . 
Now that you know or have been reminded of that , Democrats HAVE BEEN in power for the last 4 years . 
A Democrat controlled Congress passed TARP , and the Stimulus , and obummercare , and the Financial Regulation Reform , and the most recent $ 26 Billion bailout of the states that wasted the most money . 
In 4 years THEY have jacked up the National Debt about $ 4,000,000,000,000.00 -LRB- $ 4 TRILLION -RRB- So that is what THEY 've done in 4 of the 8 years you want THEY to have . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1284
To override a veto to pass a law anyway requires 2\/3 vote in both houses of Congress .

Therefore , the Democratic Congress could not pass laws that the Republicans opposed to address things like the National Debt that you conservatives are suddenly so concerned about .

You need to research where our Government actually gets GOVERNMENT income tax revenue and stop reciting the big liberal lie . 
The rich will ALWAYS get richer . 
That 's how they got rich in the first place . 
Do n't worry about the rich getting more . 
What THEY get THEY keep in play to make more . 
A tax cut for the lower middle class does NOTHING . 
THEY do n't pay income taxes now . 
80 % X 0 = 0 . 
Give THEY a 50 % tax cut . 
50 % X 0 = 0 . 
Rounded off numbers : The top 20 % in income presently pays 85 % of ALL our income tax . 
The next 30 % in income pay the remaining 15 % The bottom 50 % in income do not pay income taxes . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1287
Raise the top income tax level to about 50 % . 
Close out loopholes . 
Cut payroll taxes 50 % . 
That reduces the taxes the lower middle classes pay and addresses your concerns . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1289
Do that and what you get from the actual rich will be not a single penny more . 
Does spending $ 250,000.00 on a tax lawyer to save a million dollars on taxes sound like a smart business move to you ? 
Well that is what will happen . 
Then you have the working rich . 
CREATORS are the real job creators . 
Raise CREATORS taxes and one of 2 things happen or both . 
One , CREATORS lay off people or the raise the prices that the middle class has to pay for CREATORS products or services , -- OR BOTH . 
Net to the Govt . 
LESS , net to the middle class , higher prices , fewer jobs . 
And the rich , vested or working , are pound for pound about 5 or 6 times smarter than politicians . 
POLITICIANS win , that 's how the world works , like WORLD or not . 
Every action has an equal and opposite reaction . 
State after state HAS raised taxes and netted much , much less state income , more unemployment , and higher prices . 
No example is better than New York . 
The city and the state . 
The liberal answer is always raise the taxes on the rich and the reality is that REALITY does NOT produce ANY of the desired results . 
And when one keeps doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results , that is called what ? 
CURRENTPOSTID 1290
Something the Republicans\/conservatives pray for every night ! 
Bwahaha ! 
Barack Obama 's ratings are out of step with OBAMA achievementsA quick recollection of recent Republican governance should make voters think twice about handing Congress back to themAnd yet , we come back to the great paradox of the moment . 
The more reforms the Democrats enact , the less happy independent voters who , presumably , voted for Democrats because VOTERS wanted many of these reforms enacted are . 
If this discontent produces the sort of `` enthusiasm gap '' at the elections hinted at in many recent polls , November could indeed see significant gains for the GOP . 
That said , my guess is the gains wo n't be quite as large as many pundits think , that the much-anticipated rout wo n't actually occur . 
There are signs , in recent polls , that as the election nears and more people start paying attention to the debates , voters are starting to return to the Democrats . 
PEOPLE might detest incumbents , and , for a variety of reasons , PEOPLE may feel increasingly disillusioned with the Obama administration , but when push comes to shove most voters also are n't convinced by the GOP message . 
Predictions are always a dangerous game in politics , but at this point MY guess is that the Democrats will cling on to power , with significantly reduced majorities , in both houses of Congress .

Second your link to the CBO shows that Clinton 's first few years of spending , UNTIL CLINTON got SADDLED with a Republican Congress , was larger than Bush 's first few years . 
In actual dollars not adjusted for inflation . 
And SECOND shows as I have claimed that the receipts under Bush , before and after , the tax cuts EXCEEDED any , and ALL years of Clinton . 
And SECOND shows that as a &#37; of GDP , Debt was higher in EVERY year of Clinton than &#37; was in any year of Bush . 
And evidently the CBO , who is not responsible for PAYING any bills , just crunching numbers , does not count the ever mounting interest , that Treasury does when they have to pay bills with phantom surpluses . 
You do Bill Clinton a disservice by claiming CLINTON made a surplus . 
CLINTON was a much wiser C-in-C than this present CLOWN . 
Clinton got handed an opposing Congress . 
CLINTON went into the meeting rooms WITH the ` enemy ' and haggled out an agreement . 
You give I a tax hike and I 'll cut WELFARE ! 
Republicans could not say no to that . 
The Clown BO goes into the meeting rooms with liberal Democrats only and LOCKS out all others and then complains that no one will cooperate with THEN . 
Being a Chicago mob boss , BOSS never learned the cooperate is different than dictate . 
Clinton was wise and made the most of a bad situation .

No myth at all . 
Whether you include SS or not , the record deficit Clinton inherited from Bush was turned into a surplus , and the second Bush took the surplus and made a new record deficit . 
Clinton did SS be scaling back military spending and raising taxes . 
Bush squandered SS by slashing taxes and doubling military spending and starting wars . 
Obama inherited an economic crisis unparalleled since the great depression .

Wrong answer . 
Conservatives adopt a literal word-for-word interpretation of the United States Constitution as INTERPRETATION should be . 
Not some Liberal Jackwagon 's `` living document '' horse -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- ! 
CURRENTPOSTID 1347
You think ? 
What literal word for word interpretation of `` provide for ... the general welfare '' could mean anything other than Congress has the authority to provide for the general welfare ? 
CURRENTPOSTID 1349
The United States Constitution contains two references to `` the General Welfare '' , one occurring in the Preamble and the other in the Taxing and Spending Clause . 
It is only the latter that is referred to as the `` General Welfare Clause '' of this document . 
However , LATTER has been argued that , in the case of the United States Constitution , the statement regarding the `` general welfare '' was not then and is not now intended to give plenary power to the federal government . 
-LRB- 2 -RRB- These clauses in the U.S. Constitution are exceptions to the typical use of a general welfare clause , and are not considered grants of a general legislative power to the federal government as the U.S. Supreme Court has held : \* the Preamble to the U.S. Constitution `` has never been regarded as the source of any substantive power conferred on the Government of the United States or on any of SOURCE Departments '' ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- -LRB- 4 -RRB- and , \* that Associate Justice Joseph Story 's construction of the Article I , Section 8 General Welfare Clause as elaborated in Story 's 1833 Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States was the correct interpretation . 
-LRB- 5 -RRB- -LRB- 6 -RRB- Justice Story concluded that the General Welfare Clause was not an independent grant of power , but a qualification on the taxing power which included within CLAUSE a power to spend tax revenues on matters of general interest to the federal government . 
Thomas Jefferson explained the latter general welfare clause for the United States : -LRB- T -RRB- JEFFERSON laying of taxes is the power , and the general welfare the purpose for which the power is to be exercised . 
AND -LRB- Congress -RRB- are not to lay taxes ad libitum for any purpose AND please ; but only to pay the debts or provide for the welfare of the Union . 
In like manner , AND are not to do anything AND please to provide for the general welfare , but only to lay taxes for that purpose . 
-LRB- 7 -RRB- In 1824 Chief Justice John Marshall described in obiter dictum a further limit on the General Welfare Clause in Gibbons v. Ogden : `` Congress is authorized to lay and collect taxes , & c. to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States . 
Congress is not empowered to tax for those purposes which are within the exclusive province of the States . '' 
-LRB- 8 -RRB-

Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances . 
Let 's see . 
Conservatives take `` Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof '' to mean , Only for those establishments of religion the Republican Party and\/or conservatives approve of . 
`` The right of the people peaceably to assemble '' means PEOPLE can only assemble where the Republicans\/Conservatives think PEOPLE should , not where REPUBLICANS\/CONSERVATIVES is legal for PEOPLE , or where PEOPLE want to . 
You actually mean , as PEOPLE want RIGHT to be , right ?

CURRENTPOSTID 1358
Why progressive rates ? 
That is a manipulation . 
Do poor people use the post office equal to the rich ? 
Do PEOPLE want PEOPLE borders maintained by a militia and a navy just like a wealthy person would ? 
MILITIA seems to any objective person that for the most part all Americans benefit from having the existance of Uncle Sam and in fact poor people are a greater strain on the system by using many things the wealthy do not , such as welfare , food stamps , medicaid , section-8 housing , WIC , and others . 
People should pay for the services Uncle Sam provides equally . 
If PEOPLE and I walk into McDonald 's together ; should we not be both charged the same price for WE happy meal ? 
Would you think MCDONALD fair if you were charged $ 50 because you were sporting a Rolex , the person next to you charged $ 5 because PERSON had a Timex , and the third person given the happy meal for free because PERSON had no watch at all ? 
That is not how fairness works . 
A consumption based tax is the fairest way to deal with a Federal budget , anything less is biased and offends someone .

Actually , Obama has spent less than Bush did . 
And considering the massive recession , RECESSION would be bad economic policy to slash the government . 
Obama has frozen the federal budget for many agencys , something Republicans never did , created a national debt commision , something republicans never did , cut some military spending , something republicans never did and turned the economy around from massive reccesion to small growth . 
Sure we would all like more , but OBAMA policies are far better than republican ones . 
ignroes the people and pushed through legislation .

huh . 
The republicans have used the reconcilliation policy far more than democrats , including pushing through both misguided Bush tax cuts .

The argument by Senator Tom Coburn and others that Kagan should not be confirmed because 17TH , in FOUNDERS view , would not commit during 17TH Judiciary Committee testimony to enforcing God-given natural or inalienable rights mentioned in the Declaration of Independence .

They probably will , in fact there are talks that THEY might . 
And that means that Muslims are a lot more reasonable and understanding than recalcitrant Republicans . 
Why are you attributing what 19 Al Qaeda did to all Muslims ? 
Should all Christians be blamed when a Christian commits a horrible crime ? 
That is totally bizarre - a church , or any religious monument is usually a symbol of peace and love . 
I think this person is not being `` honest '' - just upset because MOSQUE happens to be Muslim . 
Do n't think they are certain . 
But MOSQUE is n't even a `` mosque '' - MOSQUE 's a community center . 
So your whole argument breaks down . 
Reps do n't like the Constitution as it is written because CONSTITUTION interferes with REPS agenda .

Republicans are n't the only ones against the Mosque near Ground Zero . 
I never did . 
I just think some sensitivity to the victims ' families needs to be taken into consideration . 
Islamic Community Center . 
The same can be said of most politicians . 
Most of I posts reflect , I am sick of our bloated bureaucracy in Washington wasting OUR tax dollars and not listening to The People . 
Unless your happy with Washington , big government , more taxes , more bureaucracy , you should be part of the Tea Party movement yourself .

You have a handful of Dems that got sucked into that `` sensitivity bs '' and Harry Reid , who is vying for votes from that whacko Angle , so REID has to appeal to the righties . 
When you associate American Muslims with the 9\/11 incident you are in a sense holding RIGHTIES responsible for INCIDENT . 
RIGHTIES had victims there too . 
INCIDENT is still not a mosque . 
Most politicians are n't trying to change all the amendments like the reps are .

Disclaimer . 
This is a long post and I may have made a typo or three . 
If you see something that angers you such as I not adding the &#8216; radical &#8217; prefix before &#8216; Muslim &#8217; please ask I if that is what I meant ! 
I have no problems with the Islam or Muslims or any other religion including those that have a lack of religion . 
I do have a problem with all haters who hate for unspecified reasons or simply don &#8217; t like Christianity or religion and have the need to bash Christians at every turn . 
And as a preacher church owner , and non profit Christian humanitarian mission owner I do not tolerate or will not be around I Christian brothers and sisters that hate for the same reasons as above . 
Whew ~ Hi Mertex ! 
If the supporters and those doing the funding -LRB- no one knows who is funding the Mosque as of Aug 1 2010 -RRB- etc would build somewhere else I would be willing to bet that a conservative group would donate land to build GROUP on as a reciprocal gesture of good faith . 
FUNDING 's just a guess but I know I conservatives . 
-LRB- I lean towards the conservative side mostly because of I religion -RRB- . 
Nevertheless , If CONSERVATIVES go ahead with plans to build the mosque MOSQUE will be a very dangerous place to be and MOSQUE will breed seething , venomous anger all the way round ' . 
The Mosque supporters certainly have the right to build MOSQUE , but what a gesture GESTURE would be if SUPPORTERS decided to move GESTURE ! 
As a devout Christian I too think that is wrong . 
Maybe CHRISTIAN meant radical Muslims ? 
Moderate Islam is a beautiful religion that fairly mirrors Christianity right up to where Abraham almost sacrifices ABRAHAM son . 
I surgeon of five years is a devout Muslim , and she is beautiful I must say ! 
Trust I if I lumped all Muslims together I would find another MD ! 
Yes , but that is the point , There are too many coincidences for there not to be something malicious going on . 
I was somewhat against the mosque before I found out that MOSQUE would be dedicated on the anniversary of 9\/11 ! 
That was what turned I against MOSQUE , Then I researched where the funding originated and the Cordoba group etc. . 
More bad feelings ! 
I feel the true intent is not good . 
I also feel that the good Muslims that support the Mosque as well as secular liberals etc have been fooled by this malicious element into believing that the intent and the purpose of the projected mosque is benign and meant to foster good will etc. . 
Can you clarify and expand on that ? 
What is wrong with the right-wing , GOP , Tea Party ideology ? 
Personally being an Anarchist -LRB- I would like to rearrange the USA completely -RRB- but a registered independent I feel that the right-wing , GOP , Tea Party will save our country from sure total destruction by well meaning liberals . 
LIBERALS are led by a malicious element who thinks OUR can spend OUR way out of this recession . 
Yes the malicious element is none other than Obama ! 
OBAMA insists on socializing OUR country , which is another sure way to break the bank . 
OBAMA seems hell bent to do every thing to ruin this shaky recovery -LRB- and a jobless one at that -RRB- . 
And I think OBAMA has plans for making the USA fully socialist . 
Then there is the fact that this administration thinks OUR can appease the Taliban types or the Ben Laden style terrorists who are the freedom fighters of major Islamic world powers . 
These states want to destroy Israel and the USA ASAP . 
The terrorist sponsoring nations and oil rich citizens fund & give aid and support to all anti christian anti secular western terrorists and the Islamic militants . 
CITIZENS stated primary goal is to convert or kill all of us including OUR children and everyone that does not convert to Islam . 
GOAL time to give the militarized radical Islamic terrorists an offer TERRORISTS should not and ultimately can not refuse . 
TIME should TERRORIST fair offer . 
However , OUR should then take a zero tolerance policy with regards to terror and began isolating the entire western hemisphere militarily industrially economically scientifically with emphasis on pure R&D .

Your misconceptions , misunderstandings , and outright FEAR of the tea party make your posts about them laughable . 
NO ONE at any tea party I 've attended would ever think of bringing Bush back even if NO was possible . 
The near instantaneous growth of the tea party after the elections was because we all thought WE could put the calamity of the Bush years behind WE and get on with repairing the nation . 
Instead WE were presented with an even more incompetent idiot clown without ANY clue of what the Presidency means or how to even begin doing the job . 
And now approaching 2 years later , CLOWN shows on a daily basis that CLOWN is in fact a clown that history will find hilarious , but not for many , many years . 
The good news is that CLOWN has started another vacation . 
This time on Martha 's Vineyard for 10 days . 
Did they get unpacked from the last one ? 
But when 10 's on vacation , 10 's doing less damage to the nation . 
Failure on a daily basis must be so extremely exhausting that 10 needs constant vacations . 
When the liberals lose control of Congress in Nov. 10 will need overlapping vacations from then on . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1404
Are you claiming that the Muslims that are trying to convert that Wal-mart building into a community center are radical Muslims ? 
Otherwise , WAL-MART does n't make any sense - why you would associate YOU with the Al Qaeda that is responsible for 9\/11 . 
WAL-MART would be understandable if YOU were , that YOU would not be a welcome sight anywhere near Ground Zero . 
GOP have no doubt that there would be some Christian -LRB- wealthy person -RRB- that would be more than generous and would donate the land , but most of the ones complaining are more interested in just denying these people PEOPLE Constitutional right and have created this `` sensitivity '' bs , since the building is not even that close to Ground Zero . 
GOP realize that , but conservatives do less that resembles what Christ would want CONSERVATIVES to do when LAND comes to politics , that GOP wonder why so many believe MANY are doing what Christ would want MANY to do . 
GOP wonder if Christians were the ones building a church and the Muslims were complaining , if the Christians would be as willing to move or would ONES do what so many of ONES do , and become violent and hateful . 
Like when ONES are told to remove a statue of the 10 Commandments out of a government building - and ONES go against all the laws ? 
If these Muslims are willing to build somewhere else , that would be great , but GOP can not see where we can disregard what the Constitution guarantees just to placate people 's sensitivities . 
Christians have to be sensitive to the feelings of others , too . 
She was attributing the long waits at the airports and other changes WE have had to get used to , due to the horrible crime committed on 9\/11 by some Islamic terrorists , but TERRORISTS do not make up the total Islam religion , so it is wrong to condemn all of them for what some extremists of TERRORISTS religion are doing . 
GOP answer to SHE was , if `` all '' Muslims are to be suspect , then why did WE sacrifice 4000 + of WE men and women to provide ALL with a Democracy . 
WE are willing to sacrifice WE lives to provide ALL with a democracy but start whining at ALL building a mosque , or a community center ? 
You tell GOP where that makes any sense . 
Unfortunately , most of the ones protesting the community center claim that ONES do n't have anything against Muslims , but if you are not able to distinguish between those that were responsible for 9\/11 and those who lost loved ones on 9\/11 , and want to build something that would be good , the claim becomes blurred . 
GOP just read an article where the leaders of the planned community center have decided against building CENTER there . 
ARTICLE would seem to GOP that if LEADERS had a malicious agenda LEADERS would not have given up . 
However , how do you feel about this : The New York Republican party is also said to be planning a hostile television campaign . 
Does n't sound like a bunch of Christians to GOP . 
What evil could GOP possible be planning ? 
If they are really such evil motivated people , again , why do most Republicans\/conservatives defend the Iraq war ? 
Now you have gone and called these Muslims ignorant . 
That THEY would not be able to figure out that THEY are being manipulated , sounds a little condescending and something that GOP find alarming coming from someone that calls CONDESCENDING a Christian . 
As if , those that oppose the Mosque are the only ones blessed with the ability to see beyond the obvious , and know what is in people 's hearts . 
There are other mosques in the area , and also bars . 
So , why does this one hold `` special '' powers ? 
On Sunday , Jon Kyl -LRB- R-AZ -RRB- went on Face the Nation and suggested , that with all the anchor babies running around , SUNDAY might be time to scrap the 14th Amendment . 
Now , the Senate Minority Leader agrees . 
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is the latest high-profile Republican to say Congress should reconsider the guarantee of birthright citizenship provided by the 14th Amendment , in light of the current debate over immigration reform . 
http:\/\/firedoglake.com\/2010\/08\/03\/re...-brown-people\/ I did n't say there was anything wrong with the Tea Party ideology , GOP was just reminding the other poster that even if 14TH claims 14TH is n't , 14TH posts say otherwise . 
But , as far as the right-wing , GOP , Tea Party saving our country , most of those people that are part of the Tea Party were George Bush supporters and OUR know what BUSH did to the country . 
And all GOP know of PEOPLE ideology is `` tax cuts for the wealthy '' ! 
Pardon the expression but that is a bunch of crap . 
That is the same rhetoric that Rush Limbaugh and the rest of the wealthy Republicans are saying because PEOPLE want to keep PEOPLE tax cuts . 
Wow ! 
GOP thought you sounded rational for a while - now you are beginning to sound like the rest of the `` scared to death by the GOP media '' crowd .

ITS s a run down textile mill . 
No A am not saying that . 
CHRISTIAN am suspicious of why ITS being built were its being build and do not believe the developer . 
CHRISTIAN fully agree It was not the moderate Muslims fault that their religion is being hijacked by radical elements . 
The developers are within DEVELOPERS rights to build FAULT . 
And open and dedicate on 9\/11 . 
But having the right does not make building RIGHT right ! 
CHRISTIAN feel bad for both sides that there is so much torment over this mosque , however CHRISTIAN can understand why the majority of Americans are against MOSQUE . 
A Mosque five hundred feet from ground zero . 
The terrorists were Muslim extremist . 
The prayers will blast out over a loud speaker five times a day reminding the victims and the family s of the victims what happened . 
CHRISTIAN am happy you are of the faith ! 
CHRISTIAN too am a Christian . 
CHRISTIAN was a atheist prior to that but God broke CHRISTIAN legs to make CHRISTIAN an offer CHRISTIAN couldn t refuse ie die or try Christianity ! 
Ha ha . 
Anyway well with all due respect CHRISTIAN disagree with the popular interpretation of Romans . 
Here is a site that CHRISTIAN think mirrors CHRISTIAN understanding of that scripture . 
SITE s different than what you believe , but maybe we can at least understand each others beliefs . 
CHRISTIAN am guilty of calling Obama a few names out of anger and fear and agree ANGER not anything to be proud of , but CHRISTIAN do not think ANGER s a terribly bad sin . 
http:\/\/www.wnd.com\/news\/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=22417Sorry for not putting ANGER in CHRISTIAN own words but CHRISTIAN have been writing grant proposals for the missions two days and nights non stop so the least typing CHRISTIAN have to do the better ! 
HTTP:\/\/WWW.WND.COM\/NEWS\/ARTICLE.ASP?ARTICLE_ID=22417SORRY 500 feet from ground zero and the call to prayer will easily be heard at ground zero . 
CHRISTIAN am surprised that you think the 3000 families of the dead and double that number wounded would be lying about the harm this thing is going to do . 
That saddens CHRISTIAN that you would think that especially after you are so adamant about offending Obama by calling OBAMA names etc. . 
Think about 3000 . 
3000 families that s at least six to nine thousand people not to mention the survivors of the other attacks . 
CHRISTIAN don t think FAMILIES want to deny anyone FAMILIES rights , but this kind of thing will breed real anger and hurt . 
All for what ? 
What by protesting the mosque ? 
CHRISTIAN agree that some liberal politics are more in line with Jesus teachings , but CHRISTIAN would not fear Jesus if CHRISTIAN were in a peaceful protest march when JESUS came back . 
CHRISTIAN believe the developers of the mosque has hidden motives for building the mosque too . 
CHRISTIAN will be interested in seeing where the funding is coming from . 
Christians would not build a church on top of a Muslim cemetery for starters , and CHRISTIAN believe STARTERS would . 
CHRISTIAN are a Christian would you move your church if the situation was reversed ? 
CHRISTIAN would . 
With all due respect , you seem less and less like a Christian the more you talk . 
The ten commandants plaques are tradition in most cases . 
Congress prays for the tradition as well . 
In most cases CONGRESS s the attitude of activist atheists that make Christians bow up . 
In every case CHRISTIAN have seen these atheists want to harm or destroy Christianity by forcing ends to long held traditions . 
In many cases ATHEISTS want to harm us not to improve anything . 
Your ideas of obeying corrupt government are not Christian CHRISTIAN friend . 
CHRISTIAN wish you would take some time to read opposing views . 
That link CHRISTIAN gave you is a start . 
Remember Jesus was a rebel . 
True CHRISTIAN never have . 
CHRISTIAN am a Reverend . 
So CHRISTIAN see and talk to a lot of Christians . 
There is some ignorance out there , however most traditional christians do not hate all Muslims , just the radicalized terrorists that want to impose CHRISTIANS religion on us or murder US . 
CHRISTIAN already did in CHRISTIAN first post . 
CHRISTIAN gave several reasons and CHRISTIAN am researching this mosque hoping to run down the funding . 
What would you say if Islamic terrorists were funding part of the Mosque ? 
You are rather insensitive . 
Or maybe CHRISTIAN am misreading your post please clarify POST ? 
Yea and the Mosque too ? 
The New York Republican party is also said to be planning a hostile television campaign . 
REPUBLICAN depends on how hostile the program is CHRISTIAN suppose . 
REPUBLICAN all bad stuff . 
CHRISTIAN fear that the thing will get blown up or after THING built something will happen . 
CHRISTIAN just wish THEMSELVES would not put THEMSELVES and the city full of people in harms way and build somewhere else . 
see next post this one was over ten thousand letters over the limit !

If they are really such evil motivated people , again , THEY could be planning or preparing for anything .

Too many things do not make sense ! 
We will have to wait and see I suppose . 
God help WE WE are going to need BLOCK . 
You have a very strange way of thinking , not real bad just strange . 
Absolutely no disrespect meant ! 
However , if I was casually reading your posts I would think that ATHEIST were a secular humanist atheist . 
Not a immoral atheist\/SH , but an atheist nevertheless Most conservatives must think the Iraq war was worthwhile . 
I don t and I do lean conservative . 
Huh ? 
Did you read I disclaimer ? 
Where did I call the Muslims ignorant ? 
I hope that is not your words in I mouth ! 
Oh only God will go to heaven and who will not . 
So if I were you I would not be throwing rocks cause you sure are living in a glass crib -LRB- house -RRB- ! 
No that s not what I said . 
Muslims as well as Christians follow MUSLIMS leaders . 
I do not trust the developers etc. . 
The general population of Muslims are wonderful people , which I have said over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over ! 
Even posting a disclaimer ! 
Because DISCLAIMER being dedicated on 9\/11 being built on nearly on top if not on top of the remains of victims , because the funding is hidden and VICTIMS will not reveal DISCLAIMER , because of the name of the center . 
And there is more .

If you are lumping all Muslims together as responsible for 9\/11 , then pray tell why in the hell are we killing WE soldiers to provide `` Muslims '' in Iraq with a democracy . 
That is what does n't make any sense .

So , you blame all `` Muslims '' for what 19 Al-Qaeda terrorists did ? 
That figures . 
Ignorance abounds . 
The September 11 attacks -LRB- often referred to as September 11th or 9\/11 -RRB- were a series of coordinated suicide attacks by al-Qaeda upon the United States on September 11 , 2001 . 
On that morning , 19 al-Qaeda terrorists hijacked four commercial passenger jet airliners .

The way they bow at the knee at the mention of ANGLE name would make one wonder . 
Thank God , that it is not possible to bring GOD back , because , you may deny WAY , but I know a lot of Teabaggers that worship the ground GOD walks on . 
The near instantaneous growth of the tea party after the elections was because of the `` fear '' and `` anger '' that a `` black '' man was now at the helm . 
And the instantaneous support geared at Palin -LRB- Tea Party fave -RRB- , is another indication that the Tea Party is not really interested in people who exercise frugality to reflect TEABAGGERS conservatism , but rather in someone that uses catchy phrases , made-up words and does not practice conservatism in PEOPLE own life . 
Your rantings are truly comical . 
There is none more incompetent than Bush , and certainly McSame , who was not even able to tell the state of the economy when MCSAME was at the point of collapse , nor BUSH Caribou Barbie who does n't even read the newspapers and prides SOMEONE on foreign policy because SOMEONE thinks SOMEONE can see Russia from SOMEONE back porch , can compare with Obama 's intelligence , eloquence and capabilities . 
That is the dream of right-wing fanatics of Bush , because FANATICS would love for someone to replace that Bozo in the `` worst President '' category , unfortunately , MCSAME does n't look like MCSAME is going to happen . 
Already , Obama has been given accolades that Bush does n't even know how to pronounce . 
Obama 15th Greatest President Funny that you should mention that , being that Bozobush is known for having taken the most time off than any other president .

RECORD is the constant sniping and whining from the `` right '' that wears on BUSH , but BUSH is resilient enough to withstand all that vitriol .

ORAnd this one is hilarious , The America that now sees a 45 to 44 approval rating of Bush over obie the idiot . 
That America ? 
In the USA we have 2 newspaper that lean right . 
ALL the rest are very to extremely leftist and do nothing but run what amounts to commercials for liberal ideas . 
WE have one TV station that leans right , but does present the other side . 
All the rest of TV is exactly like the leftist newspapers . 
On radio there are some right leaning to very right wing talk shows . 
And the same can be said for the left , only there are more of them . 
So in media matters the left dominates communication by more than 20 to 1 . 
Maybe 100 to 1 . 
Yet , America , does not believe the bill of goods the left is selling . 
America hears your story 20 or more times for every time they hear the story from the right , yet THEY side with the story from the right . 
Is the right that much more convincing , or is the right simply pointing out what the intelligent nation can see for NATION . 
You want more respect from America ? 
Stop insulting THEY intelligence . 
THEY can see the stupidity and unsustainability of your liberalism BETTER than you can .

The Bush tax cuts sun-setting will not raise taxes on the middle class under the Democrat 's proposed plan . 
SUN-SETTING will only raise taxes on individuals grossing over $ 200,000 or families grossing over $ 250,000 . 
Do your homework . 
Also , stop lying . 
Saying LYING 's going to raise taxes on everyone is nothing but your own wistful thinking . 
Do n't peddle THINKING as fact . 
What ? 
LYING has actually cut useless or wasteful government programs in order to save a few billion dollars here and there . 
I think you 're mistaking Obama with Bush . 
Also , stop lying . 
Popular opinion is a fickle thing and changes depending on who is better at communicating their message . 
Republicans are notoriously good at doing so through emotionally charge rhetoric and propaganda . 
Some of us -LRB- I included -RRB- rely on facts to form US opinions rather than rhetoric , so while you may disagree -LRB- for whatever reason -RRB- with cost-saving measures such as insurance reform , SOME are the right thing to do both morally and financially . 
Yet again ... what the hell ? 
ICE has actually deported more people under Obama than PEOPLE did under Bush , and Obama has only been in office for a year and a half . 
Where are you getting your `` facts '' from ?

Troops are Troops .

But that 's not even the crux of INTEL . 
All that 's changed is Obama and DoD retitled Brigade Combat Teams to `` advisory and assistance brigades . '' 
The troops still in Iraq will still be in combat when TROOPS go on missions with Iraqi troops .

Like spending our way to prosperity on borrowed money . 
Or , `` OUR are going to win the Afghan war and leave next year . '' 
Stupid . 
If he was not both driven and bound by HE ideology , HE would react to the problems instead of pushing the same old , same old , tired program . 
Once again last night , in HE speech , HE philosophizes with no specifics , and then promotes , more regulation , education reform , and cap and trade .

The illegal aliens which means the Hispanic voting block . 
And of course the black voting block . 
I beleive that this is a calculated strategy and one that will fail because the votes are not there .

If OBAMA gets OBAMA way with Cap & Trade and Amnesty , US 're in for some real hurt .

And that is why , even though at heart I disagree with most liberal positions , I am not in favor of the republican party regaining power anytime soon .

Maybe then , when REPUBLICANS start listening to REPUBLICANS constituents again and start looking after the interests of America rather than just lining CONSTITUENTS own pockets , REPUBLICANS will be worth voting for again . 
Until then , I am likely to vote for Obama again as -LRB- as I stated in a post just a little ways back in this here very thread -RRB- the lesser of two evils . 
And no , I have not seen anything put forth by the republicans lately that was really worth consideration . 
REPUBLICANS seem to have based REPUBLICANS entire strategy on doing and saying whatever REPUBLICANS think will most obstruct and\/or tear down Obama and the democratic party . 
When REPUBLICANS start acting in America 's interests rather than the republican party 's interests , REPUBLICANS might become relevant again .

The Republicans WERE awful , and were REPLACED in the Nov. 2006 elections and the Dems sworn in in Jan 2007 . 
Or did n't you know that . 
So the truly awful Republicans -LRB- no disagreement there -RRB- were replaced by the Democrats who HAVE DONE WORSE ! 
Pelosi , and Reid have been in CONGRESS for 20 + years and Biden even longer . 
What were they doing ? 
We NEED to dump career , and corrupt -LRB- same thing -RRB- politicians of both parties . 
The Republicans deserved to be replaced , AND WERE . 
Now the Democrats are even more deserving of being thrown out . 
Sadly that only leaves the Republicans to take the Democrats place , and POLITICIANS are looking LESS evil than the Dems .

You wanna know why 1.3 trillion is good ? 
because when we had a surplus G.W. cut taxes , increased spending , and took a machete to regulations . 
When Obama took office right after the http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?gl=IE&amp;h...&amp;v=mEkY7_i7MJs . 
Now , instead of raising taxes when WE had a surplus and the economy was good , SURPLUS was thrown away , dribbled into haliburton and the banks . 
Because the Bush tax cut for the rich expired 1.4 years into Obama 's term , it was meant to make BUSH look like BUSH was raising taxes in a time in recession when in fact it was just a ploy to make the democratic president , whoever CUT was look bad , because even Bush knew after the havic BUSH knew BUSH 'd create no republican would take office after HAVIC . 
So is Obama perfect ? 
no. . 
Was OBAMA dealt a bad hand ? 
yes , YES had no where but down to go , and without spending for stimulous we 'd keep going down . 
Is Obama doing what truly needs to be done to fix WE broken system of government feeding the rich who gamle WE money away ? 
no , but honestly OBAMA think republicans would be even worse , historically speaking than the man in office now .

Out of Control Govt spending and the National Debt would be 2 complaints that most tea party groups have in common . 
How to fix those things and many , many others are points of disagreement in the various tea parties , same as MANY are in society in general .

Obama is not following the paygo program . 
Obama wants to raise taxes now , before the economy recovers , Obamacare will do anything but save money , and OBAMA is doing things to increase the deficit . 
The only thing that has happened so far that will save us money , was the draw-down of Iraq . 
However , much of that expense is just being shifted to Afghanistan . 
The reason the deficit is getting so high , is because Obama and OBAMA Democratic goons are spending US into oblivion .

Obama has not proposed any such program of raising taxes before the recovery is over . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1524
He 's letting the Bush tax cuts expire . 
HE may agree to keep them in place for middle America , however , but small business will suffer . 
Many tax increases come into play on 1\/1\/2011 due to Obamacare . 
Cap & Trade : Tax Increases , energy increases = increase in the cost of goods and services . 
Report : Obama 's tax increase on oil and gas would cost thousands of jobs : President Obama 's proposed tax increases on oil and gas companies would cause over 154,000 workers to lose THOUSANDS jobs , according to a new report by Louisiana State University economist Dr. Joseph Mason . 
The report also finds that Obama 's proposal would reduce economic output by $ 341 billion and create over $ 68 billion in lost wages nationwide . 
`` Though politicians think POLITICIANS are selectively targeting ` Big Oil ' with these energy tax proposals , POLITICIANS would actually devastate thousands of small American businesses nationwide as well as the workers who depend on POLITICIANS , '' Mason said in prepared remarks . 
`` With at least 150,000 U.S. jobs at stake in fields ranging from healthcare to real estate 150,000 's clear that the cost of repealing Section 199 and dual capacity far outweigh the potential benefit of increased government revenues that may be derived from the proposal . 
`` Obama recently proposed paying for OBAMA $ 50 billion plan to improve the country 's infrastructure system by increasing taxes on the oil and gas industry . 
Mason points out that if Congress follows through on MASON plan , the effect might be worse than MASON calculations because MASON estimates do not include how individual investors would be affected by the tax increase . 
Source : http:\/\/thehill.com\/blogs\/on-the-mone...s-to-lose-jobsLieberman throws cold water on Obama 's tax proposal : Writers on the left end of the spectrum seemed buoyed by would-be Speaker John Boehner 's statement over the weekend that OBAMA party could , in fact , support President Barack Obama and the Democrats on a partial extension of the Bush-era tax cuts . 
The Obama position - the same one endorsed back home by members of the Congressional delegation and candidates like Attorney General Richard Blumenthal - is that the income tax cuts should be extended for people making less than $ 250,000 per year , as well as for businesses . 
The only cuts that would be allowed to expire as scheduled would be those on people making $ 250,000 per year or more , or roughly 2 percent of taxpayers . 
TPM has the exchange , from `` Face the Nation '' : Bob Schieffer : `` SCHIEFFER want to make sure SCHIEFFER heard what you said correctly : YOU 're saying that YOU are willing to vote for those middle class tax cuts , even though the bill will not include ... extending the tax cuts for the upper bracket American . '' 
Rep. Boehner : `` Bob , YOU do n't know what the bill 's going to say , alright ? 
If the only option BOEHNER have is to vote for those at 250 and below , of course BOEHNER 'm going to do that . 
But BOEHNER 'm going to do everything BOEHNER can to fight to make sure that YOU extend the current tax rates for all Americans . 
`` That certainly looks like the President winning a game of chicken with the Republican minority , especially given that Democratic members of Congress -LRB- Rep. Joe Courtney , for example -RRB- have lately sounded resigned to the likelihood that MEMBERS will have to vote to extend all the cuts , even on the rich , since doing nothing would result in hiking taxes on the middle class . 
And since Republicans , by simply folding MEMBERS arms and saying no to anything but the full slate of tax cuts , would force Democrats to choose between extending a boon for multimillionaires or delivering nothing and handing MULTIMILLIONAIRES opponents another club to use in the fall campaigns . 
Why would Boehner blink ? 
Perhaps because , as with so many other issues in the last year , the Senate will carry the day . 
Today , here 's Sen. Joe Lieberman , a registered Democrat who makes a lot of registered Democrats see red , explaining that LIEBERMAN 'll be holding out for the same thing Boehner is : extending the cuts for everybody .

FACT 's an economic fact that the poor and middle class put money into the economy faster than the rich . 
The rich do put a lot in savings . 
They invest too but those investments do n't always see THEY trickling down to the common man . 
Hell there is no guarantee that money is going to American interests . 
THEY could be investing in a company based in London or China . 
Plus in an environment where demand is low ... like ... in a recession ... THEY are n't going to risk the money to expand operations when demand does n't warrant RECESSION . 
We gave the rich a tax cut and instead of growing WE lost millions of jobs . 
But when WE raised taxes on MILLIONS and cut taxes for the middle class and gave the middle class temporary work MILLIONS spent that extra money . 
Now demand is up . 
Businesses are profiting again . 
And the private sector is hiring . 
SECTOR 's clear which strategy works and which does not . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1529
What brainwashed BS . 
Economies grow through INVESTMENTS , not through spending . 
And the only job growth under the dummy oBum has been in Govt jobs . 
Since OBUM was elected private sector jobs are a net loss . 
And if the taxes are increased on people making over $ 250,000 . 
LOSS will bring the 2011 deficit down from $ 1.27 trillion to $ 1.07 trillion -LRB- CBO -RRB- LOSS will TAKE $ 200 billion out of the economy and put LOSS in the hands of politicians , WHERE LOSS WILL BE MOSTLY WASTED . 
Reduced Govt spending by a mere 5 % and we would be in the exact same place and the $ 200 billion would stay in the economy where SPENDING can do good . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1530

And is constantly distracted by tiny minor issues like a cop and prof in Mass. or the Sherrod fiasco , which was 100 % COP fault . 
And other distractions like the oil spill go unnoticed for months before COP can find time for them . 
COP can not handle a full plate all at once . 
COP has a decision making process that can only kindly be called ` confused , ' and COP has n't a clue how to judge people . 
The White House staff has 41 people owing the Govt over $ 800,000.00 in unpaid taxes , and a Treasury Secretary that could n't figure out COP own individual taxes . 
You say , `` WHY DO N'T WE PAY OUR BILLS !? ''

in the Treasury or CUT those Govt jobs and get people in there with integrity and honor .2012 ca n't come too soon to bid good riddance to this idiot .

How does STILL `` stimulate '' if STILL is not spent ? 
And why does THEN need MORE `` stimulus '' money when 40 &#37; of THE STIMULUS is still on the books ? 
IF MONEY was a good idea . 
And IF MONEY was an emergency . 
WHY is more needed when the `` emergency funds '' have yet to `` stimulate '' anything and remain UNSPENT ?? 
Asking questions of an administration that does not EVER make any sense is not neurosis , ADMINISTRATION is the responsibility of every citizen .

CURRENTPOSTID 1560
Yes . 
I am justifying getting food stamps so I can afford to buy things other than just food . 
As such I am helping the economy more than I would be if I was n't on food stamps and only spending money on food . 
I have great pride in I decision to get food stamps because I am helping America get back on track . 
If more of our nation 's poor took advantage of government assistance programs designed specifically for them then then even more businesses would benefit . 
Demand would go up . 
And businesses would be forced to expand to make up for the new demand . 
Which means more jobs which ultimately means less people dependent on food stamps . 
Food stamps also allows I to be independent from I parents . 
Who ca n't afford to take care of I . 
Which means PARENTS too can spend money on things like paying off PARENTS mortgage so PARENTS do n't become another foreclosure statistic . 
Thank god food stamps exist so that people like I who struggle with academics and require lots of time studying can afford to go to school and eat at the same time . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1561

So I choose not to work . 
Just like plenty of other college students . 
And there is nothing wrong with PLENTY . 
The government will be taking way more in taxes from I after I graduate than the amount I get in food stamps . 
Also I would not be able to get through college without this assistance . 
Which means I would n't be able to make the high salary I plan to achieve after I graduate . 
Which means the government would be missing out on hundreds of thousands of tax dollars during I career . 
So yes . 
on many factors getting food stamps is helping the economy . 
Not only the business end but END is helping END to gain more revenue in the future . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1571
And thanks to those food stamps I can afford to go to college to get a high salary job which will have high taxes which will be used to pay for some other college kid 's food stamps .

That 's why there is n't a politician in their right mind suggesting we get rid of JOB . 
Only conservatives who do n't understand how economics work .

A lot of truth in that . 
Like most things , LOT 's a matter of incentives . 
Politicians have an incentive to give people what POLITICIANS want and American 's consistently want more than PEOPLE can afford . 
As long as politicians are allowed to borrow money , the inevitable result is short term patches , snowballing debt , and an eventual crash . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1574
You really think those tax dollars `` pumped into '' the economy would n't have been spent had the government not forcibly taken them from people in order to give you the privilege of spending someone else 's money ? 
The reason politicians do n't shut down this type of forced charity is not because of some greater economic good , GOOD 's because more voters want a free ride than are being abused by our tax system . 
POLITICIANS keep TYPE going to get votes , stay in office , and collect an unearned paycheck . 
You can , but odds are you wo n't . 
The fact that the height of your ambition is to get a salary rather than trying to really make an impact on the economy suggests you 'll never pay enough in taxes to even equal what you take out of the government much less help someone else .

An economic fact that more money is pumped into the economy thanks to food stamps , than the program costs . 
That is not only a blatant lie , LIE is also impossible . 
LIE can not pump anything IN after the same program took the money OUT of the economy .

t if you wish or make up nonsense as you go along . 
I went to college working 2 jobs , 1 full time , 1 part time . 
AND had a wife and 2 kids .

Wealth just moves TREND 's way up and once ONCE gets there ONCE does not come back down . 
Wealthy business owners only spend enough to make more money . 
OWNERS do not hire just because OWNERS have extra money lying around . 
Because if OWNERS did that OWNERS might lose money if OWNERS are more productive than OWNERS demand warrants . 
So the money gets put in a bank . 
Or an inheritance fund . 
Or some other place where FUND just sits and makes more money on interest or dividends . 
Sure some of PLACE might `` trickle down '' but PLACE goes up many times faster than PLACE comes down . 
The income tax was designed from the start to balance this issue out . 
TAX was designed to take money from those who are n't spending TAX and are instead hording TAX to make more money for THOSE . 
That money then goes to programs to assist lower income families . 
Whether through food , education , healthcare , or just putting a little extra money in FAMILIES pockets . 
This in turn creates more consumers , which means more demand , which forces employers to hire more , which makes businesses sell more product . 
SYSTEM 's a delicate economic system that ensures everyone gets a piece of the pie . 
Some might get bigger pieces but at least everyone is eating pie . 
This system keeps our economy healthy . 
Taking those taxes away only insures the rich get richer and the poor gets poorer .

One of the most perverse assertions I 've ever heard , too often repeated by those who are unable to earn the lifestyle they demand . 
More accurately , wealth moves from those that consume much and produce little to those that consume less less than THOSE produce . 
This is n't a flaw in capitalism , FLAW is n't about money getting `` stuck . '' 
FLAW happens because some participants in our economy provide insufficient value to earn money but feel PARTICIPANTS have a right to spend ECONOMY . 
Arbitrarily taking wealth from those who deliver value and gifting FLAW to those who do n't does n't balance out some inherent flaw in capitalism , FLAW masks and excuses the actual failure . 
The failure is n't that some citizens are `` hording '' dollars , FAILURE 's that others are failing to provide anything worth the dollars OTHERS covet . 
If you truly think OUR economy is best served by maximizing consumption at the expense of productivity , explore the extreme of your theory . 
If all wealth was collected weekly under a single tax and then evenly redistributed -- how would OUR economy fair ?

You do n't really understand anything about economics , do you ? 
Obama took office , and the economy was in free fall . 
The reason we got 10 &#37; unemployment has absolutely nothing to do with Barrack Obama . 
As I said , the economy was already in free fall . 
But that was not only bush 's fault . 
FAULT was a culmination of 30 years of bad economic policy beginning with Ronald Reagan , continuing through HW Bush and Clinton , and ultimately ending in Bush 's administration . 
Poor policy enacted by the federal reserve also played a major role . 
So if you truly believe Obama had anything to do with causing unemployment to go to 10 % you are delusional and so incredibly partisan that WASTE is a waste of I time to even write this post . 
But if you are capable of thinking critically , you will realize that is nonsense , and try to actually evaluate policy independently and intelligently . 
Then if you wanted to blame Obama for the fact that the economy has not recovered more quickly -LRB- OBAMA could certainly have done more -RRB- , or the fact that OBAMA reformed health care without actually making health care more affordable and accessible for the average person , or that OBAMA has failed to competently regulate the banks , etc then I would say you certainly have a point . 
But if you want to blame Obama for a recession that was already happening before OBAMA took office , you are going to have to be incredibly dishonest .

Obama has cut taxes . 
OBAMA did n't set the sunset provisions in the Bush tax cuts . 
Bush was President when that happened and obama was not even in the Senate when Bush signed SENATE into law . 
I 've searched all through government websites and have not found anything called `` Obamacare . 
But , the health care reform law that President Obama signed will slow the growth of health care costs for our country and will help reduced deficit spending . 
That 's assuming those big spenders in the GOP do n't gain control of the government . 
Which shows what a failure bush and the GOP are on national defense and budget issues . 
SPENDERS start a war in Afghanistan as the WoT , then -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- near stop WOT to start a war on Iraq , that had nothing at all to do with terrorism or OUR national defense , then allowed al Qaeda\/Taliban to grow strong after having SPENDERS on the run .

SUPPORTER am not a supporter of Obama or OBAMA health care bill , but to answer your question SUPPORTER 'd argue that the post office is one example . 
Every year , SUPPORTER sit down with carriers from UPS and FedEx to hammer out an agreement for shipping in the coming year and the existence of the post office as an inferior but sufficient fall back option keeps ever rising costs from both companies in check in a way that competition between the two does not . 
Real health care reform could have provided a similar inferior but sufficient health service for our citizens that had a similar effect on OUR health care industry . 
Sadly , OUR got Obamacare instead . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1612
According to the US Govt Accounting Office , Not FOX , not the tea party , not any right wing media or publication . 
LOSSES for the USPS in 2008 $ 2.8 BILLION , 2009 $ 3.0 BILLION , and 2010 looks to be worse . 
So whatever savings you THINK you 're getting by playing the USPS off private carriers , is more than offset in the taxes needed to support the failing USPS . 
But probably , more than any other Govt office , the USPS is trying to be competitive . 
But in the real business world , trying to be competitive , but failing , meant bankruptcy . 
Now if you 're well connected , NOW means bailout . 
If not well connected , bankrupt .

If one has ANY group policy and changes jobs , the new insurer has had to cover THOSE as long as THOSE have had `` CREDIBLE COVERAGE '' for the 18 months before changing carriers . 
That is and was the law . 
Same as lifetime coverage limits . 
For an insurance company to set a approval-able rate , REQUIRED BY LAW , THOSE have to know what THOSE EXPOSURE is . 
So if CAP is a $ 2 million lifetime cap , the insurance company KNOWS THOSE max exposure and knows what factor to add in to the premium to cover that . 
These are long standing laws before the actual birth , wherever BIRTH was , of obummer . 
Now the obamacare bill stops pre-existing exclusions and lifetime caps . 
Meaning 100 % certain that premiums WILL go up . 
THEY ALREADY ARE GOING UP !! 
UNEMPLOYMENT is down 1\/2 percent ??? '' 
From May through August , thejobless rate remained in the range of 9.5 to 9.7 percent . 
`` And in reality has stayed in the same range for more than a year . 
So the BLS , not ALREADY , says you do n't know what YOU 're talking about . 
Fluctuating between 10 % and 9.5 % is FLUCTUATING , not going down . 
Or is that liberal math ? 
10 % MINUS 9.7 % EQUALS 1\/2 PERCENT ? 
Not in the real world .

A poll pitting obummer against ANY REPUBLICAN , said oBum would lose . 
OBUMMER started at 65 % approval and began losing that as is normal . 
But as time went on and OBUMMER became more and more revealed as both arrogant without any reason to be arrogant , AND sadly incompetent at the same time , OBUMMER approval fell down to OBUMMER sheeple base of about 46 % . 
That was over a year ago . 
Slowly some of the sheeple base has been opening SOME eyes and over the last year OBUMMER has slowly gone down to 42 % . 
After Nov. OBUMMER WILL drop into the 30 's and then OBUMMER is finished . 
Even the Democrat National Committee will then acknowledge OBUMMER as the empty suit in the White House . 
Some Democrats already see that . 
Are you aware that almost universally , Democrats running for re-election are avoiding any mention of obummer or OBUMMER policies . 
They 're trying to make THEY look like pseudo-Republicans .

That is not true . 
Beginning with the Dem tax increase in 1993 , tax revenues grew far faster than the economy . 
Spending however , grew much slower than the economy , a trend that continued thru 20001 . 
That is the difference between a conservative and a liberal . 
The conservative says you have a pre-existing condition ? 
Tough just get sick and die . 
The liberal says everyone shares the risk . 
We are all Americans . 
That 's why THAT 'm proud to be a liberal . 
Unemployment rate : Oct 2009 10.1 % Aug 2009 9.6 % http:\/\/www.bls.gov\/webapps\/legacy\/cpsatab1.htm10.1-9.6 = 0.5 % or 1\/2 % . 
THAT stand by THAT post . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1638
A pre-existing condition is something that presented CONDITION before you chose to have the insurance . 
A person applying for insurance for a pre-existing condition is taking no risk , they know THEY will use the services THEY are asking to receive at a discount . 
That cost savings to THEY will be paid for by others , who risked buying insurance without knowing if THEY would develop the need . 
The conservative asks why did n't you buy insurance before you developed this condition when we could all share the risk ? 
The liberal answers because I did n't want to risk I money , I 'd rather have you take care of I . 
That 's why I 'd be embarrassed to be a liberal . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1639
That is not necessarily true at all . 
That is the idea behind insurance . 
The liberal answers that I had IDEA and lost I job or was dropped by I carrier . 
The conservate answers then go ahead and die . 
That 's why I 'd be ashamed to be a conservative . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1640
Then you have no problem . 
When you lost your job you chose COBRA to continue your coverage or you bought new insurance when you were dropped by your carrier . 
In either case , you had uninterrupted coverage and so your current carrier does not consider your current ailment as a pre-existing condition . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1641
I think you are confusing the ideas of insurance and charity . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1642
I 'm not . 
The purpose of insurance is to spread the risk among a population . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1643
The purpose of insurance is to TRANSFER the risk to an insurance company in exchange for a premium . 
Insurance companies are FOR PROFIT organizations . 
-LRB- I realize that the words , FOR PROFIT , are very confusing for liberals . -RRB- 
It means that LIBERALS MUST take in more money in premiums than LIBERALS pay out in claims and operating costs . 
It also means that LIBERALS must keep the premiums at a sellable amount . 
It is not necessary for you to believe that , but AMOUNT is absolutely true . 
Insurance companies COULD insure anybody , or everybody , for everything . 
But NO ONE would be able to afford the premium COMPANIES would HAVE to charge in order to be profitable . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1644
Then you 've definitely confused them . 
As I pointed out , the person you are describing has no risk . 
PERSON liability is certain . 
You are not spreading out risk , you are simply spreading PERSON definite cost to others .

No one said anything about insurance companies , but insurance . 
I agree insurance companies exists FOR PROFIT . 
That means , to MAXIMIZE PROFIT insurance companies will drop people with conditions and try to avoid paying with exceptions in COMPANIES policies . 
And that is why , because insurance companies exist to MAXIMIZE PROFIT COMPANIES will not cover you if you are old or have a pre-existing condition because you are more likely to get SICK and need HEALTH CARE . 
So unless your view is that only those who are young and healthy and who can afford to pay for coverage FOR PROFIT insurance companies provide should be able to get HEALTH CARE , this is exactly why a system of private insurance based on FOR PROFIT insurance companies DOES NOT WORK . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1647
There is no `` insurance '' without insurance companies .

Insurance companies MUST be for profit -LRB- I said in a previous post that you would n't understand that and obviously you do n't -RRB- and COMPANIES do exist and COMPANIES do work and COMPANIES have worked for many years . 
The problem with health insurance specifically is that your kind of liberal thinking has screwed KIND up . 
You want insurance to be a payor of convenience and PROBLEM can NEVER be that . 
PROBLEM must only cover risk , and the more risk we ask PROBLEM to cover , the MORE expensive PROBLEM MUST be . 
The present problem is that everyone wants the health insurance company to PAY from the first dollar of charges on . 
That causes the premium to be higher because WE are transferring ALL risk to the insurance company . 
When they also have to cover pre ex and no limits , the premiums MUST go MUCH higher . 
There is NO way around that . 
WE do NOT ask any other type of insurance to do that , why do WE ask health insurance to be a payor of convenience instead of covering WE UNACCEPTABLE risk . 
Would you pay a $ 200.00 dollar collision premium on a $ 500 car ? 
No , because the $ 500 . 
RISK is acceptable . 
Same thing , even if you went to the Doctor every month @ $ 100.00 per visit and your insurer paid for each visit . 
NO MUST charge you a premium that will cover NO known risk of what might happen with your health AND that premium also has to be high enough to also cover your $ 100 per month Doc charges . 
ie the premium MUST be much higher than $ 1200 per year . 
Probably 2 to 3 times higher since the first $ 1200 is only recovering NO costs .

We are talking about people buying insurance and asking to be covered for conditions that pre-existed their having insurance -LRB- if THEIR have in place prior insurance that covered the condition , this is a non-issue -RRB- . 
What I have said in I previous post is not true for only some , but for everyone who asks to be covered for a pre-existing condition . 
Everyone of these people is asking for something beyond insurance , PEOPLE are not trying to share the risk that PEOPLE might need treatment with others who also might need treatment . 
PEOPLE are asking others to pay more , so PEOPLE can pay less , for treatment PEOPLE know PEOPLE will need . 
If you want to institute this , make the argument . 
But do not characterize this as simply insurance or characterize THIS as risk sharing -- THIS is neither . 
THIS is charity . 
To be clear , I am not saying it is wrong to offer charity . 
But THIS is misleading to claim this would be anything other than charity .

From one side of your mouth you say Medicare and Social Security are INSURANCE . 
But on other threads you claim that the Medicare and Social Security beneficiaries ARE NOT entitled to BENEFICIARIES benefits even though BENEFICIARIES paid in to the program all BENEFICIARIES lives and in the case of Medicare BENEFICIARIES continue to pay at $ 100 . 
per month per person . 
You want to take away those benefits to reduce the debt .

in &#183; sur &#183; ance -LRB- n-shrns -RRB- a. Coverage by a contract binding a party to indemnify another against specified loss in return for premiums paid . 
You intimate in previous posts that insurance companies are making a killing . 
Just as your lying clown in the White House constantly claims COMPANIES are . 
When the fact is that if insurance companies had a raw material cost like manufacturers do , COMPANIES could not make FACT on 3.3 &#37; profit . 
When shown that insurance companies are not making a killing you say , `` Interesting , So What ? '' 
So what is that is shows your position to be pure ideological nonsense and brainwashing . 
Without any fact to give credence to your nonsense .

Please read AND comprehend the definition of insurance above . 
It is obvious you have no idea of the concept of insurance . 
If you did understand what insurance IS , you would understand that your arguments have no merit whatsoever . 
And is MERIT possible that you could actually believe that insurance companies have been in existence for well over 100 years and the politicians have not been massively regulating POLITICIANS for many decades . 
What other 100 plus year old industry has Govt kept COMPANIES nose out of ? 
RIGHT ! 
NONE , including insurance . 
Your clown-in-charge lied many times about the man with cancer that had CLOWN-IN-CHARGE insurance canceled to avoid the expense by the insurer . 
Every word of that story was a lie .1 . 
POLICY was a NEW policy . 
2 . 
He had pre-existing conditions that HE FAILED to list on the application . 
3 Insurance regulation BY THE STATE GOVTS allows insurers 2 years to investigate a new policy for pre-existing conditions . 
4 . 
The man appealed because MAN pre-ex was not cancer and MAN had no pre-ex of cancer . 
5 . 
The insurance company was totally justified in canceling the policy for cause , BUT THEY DID RELENT BECAUSE THE PRE-EX WAS NOT CANCER . 
They were NOT forced to relent , the insurance company choose to cover the man 's cancer treatment and THEY did . 
6 . 
MAN underwent the full range of cancer treatment , paid for by the insurance company . 
7 . 
MAN lived another 4 years after the completion of treatment . 
But the lying obummer said OBUMMER insurance canceled the man 's policy and OBUMMER died FOR lack OF TREATMENT . 
Total lies to con bad legislation on the public Luckily all but the brainless sheeple know LUCKILY was lying . 
. 
Once a policy is in force and past the 2 year look back . 
Insurance companies BY LAW , can not cancel a health insurance policy for an individual except for non-payment of premium .

that the nation will not survive as a socialist country IMO , and by taking REPUBLIC down ME meant REPUBLIC won t be a capitalist representative democratic republic as IMO is today , but rather some type of socialist Nation , with Obama at the helm of course . 
Rev said -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- ` ill thought out idealism ' -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- ME was suggesting that -RRB- thought things would work by the power of -RRB- personality and popularity .

MEDICARE 's not wrong at all . 
There is no contract that guarantees you SS or medicare benefits . 
The fact you paid taxes in life does give you entitlements . 
I 've never claimed SS is an insurance policy . 
I 've said POLICY is social insurance , like insurance the pool resources and provide benefits if and only if certain conditions occur . 
I 've intimated nothing of the sort . 
Quit wasting I time with strawmen .

I 've lumped all of the above in one quote , since all of it shows you to have no knowledge of the country you live in . 
The above programs , Medicare , and Social Security are each INSURANCE . 
Both are coverage in exchange for premiums . 
One is medical coverage , one is social coverage . 
And BOTH are our ONLY 2 `` ENTITLEMENT '' programs . 
Entitlements are bad mouthed on both sides of the aisle , but what BOTH are lumping in with M & SS are give away programs , which are not entitlements , BOTH are welfare , like subsidized housing , food stamps , Medicaid . 
OUR 2 real entitlement programs have PAID BOTH premiums . 
It is the politicians , both parties , that have blown the Med . 
& SS money on many things including the welfare programs listed above , that do not pay in a penny but take out Billions per year . 
But I digress , Medicare and Social Security are insurance programs MANDATED by the Govt . 
We do not have the choice of paying for BILLIONS or not . 
The premiums are taken in the form of FICA taxes . 
Are you in any way aware of what F.I.C.A. means ? 
Federal INSURANCE Contributions Act . 
And is separate from income taxes . 
6.2 &#37; and 1.45 % of income is taken FOR Social Security and Medicare respectively . 
And both are means tested . 
Medicare the more you 've made in your working life , the more you 've paid in , but you receive only the exact same benefit of anyone that made minimum wage for only 40 quarters of BOTH working life . 
Plus if you make over $ 100,000 and you 're on Medicare , you monthly premium is higher than people making less . 
Plus those in lower income ranges can have premiums lower or waived altogether and co-pays reduced or zeroed . 
Social Security , the more you made , the more you paid in , the more benefit you receive . 
THAT is means testing . 
And if one is making over $ 108,000 . 
their SS tax stops , as does the accrual of any more benefit . 
Yes , those people will get the max SS payout , but PEOPLE also paid the highest PREMIUMS . 
And if PEOPLE are still making high incomes PEOPLE pay income tax on PEOPLE SS benefits at regular income tax rates on 50 % of the benefit , or 85 % of the benefit depending on PEOPLE income . 
People living on SS alone , do not pay any income tax on PEOPLE SS benefits . 
Your every post makes TAX obvious to all readers that you either do hate the rich or you have been ideologically brainwashed into reciting the present day liberal line . 
In years past the liberal line was TAX BIG BUSINESS . 
But when PEOPLE realized that the public KNEW that just meant higher prices , liberals changed to the `` hate the rich '' nonsense . 
And you have quite obviously bought into that stupidity , wholeheartedly . 
Again your basic misconceptions about insurance show through . 
Excluding coverage for those WITH pre-existing conditions is done , with 100 % approval of insurance regulators -LRB- elected or appointed politicians -RRB- , solely to keep premiums lower for those who are transferring risk to the insurance company in exchange for a premium . 
Covering anyone already needing treatment is transferring COST , not risk . 
RISK is a necessary factor in the insurance equation . 
Insurance companies CAN NOT be in the business of taking on COSTS , COMPANIES have to take on RISK . 
Do n't know why you are UNABLE to grasp that simple concept . 
Your position is one of misconception , and ideological nonsense , and distortions . 
And I was being kind to say you have a sense of humor . 
Your fuzzy glimpse of reality is sad , not funny . 
If I was predisposed to feel sorry for people , I 'm not , I 'd feel sorry for you 
CURRENTPOSTID 1674
I can see your point . 
I 'll agree medicare is like insurance to , in a way . 
You seem to have the mistaken impression that a political view that the wealthy ought to pay more taxes equates to hate . 
Of course IMPRESSION does n't . 
Cost is a function of risk . 
I completely understand that a person who is aged or has a pre-existing condition carries a greater risk of higher cost . 
That is why for profit private insurers will seek to cut out such persons . 
And why a system of private insurance does not work for national heath care . 
I disagree with your opinions . 
Others can decide for OTHERS . 
I can tell you are not the kind who would feel sorry for people .

What was the good reason for Bush squandering a surplus and running up $ 5 trillion in debt ? 
What was the good reason for Reagan taking a small deficit and quadrupling DEFICIT and tripling the debt ? 
Obama inherited the worst economic situation since the great depression that mandated fiscal stimulus . 
I agree OBAMA needs to reduce the deficits and should raise taxes and trim spending . 
I 've said SITUATION many times . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1689
What you can not comprehend is that they always have a `` good '' reason . 
Same as obummer has a `` good '' reason . 
But THEY good reason AND obummer 's good reasons are simply excuses put out by the spenders . 
THERE is no good reasons for spending Trillions we do not have . 
There was no good reason then , there is no good reason now . 
And you need to study history with your eyes and ears and mind open . 
What obummer faced and faces is about 1\/2 as bad as what Reagan faced . 
Less than half actually . 
Same bad economy , same bad unemployment PLUS massive DOUBLE DIGIT INFLATION . 
I lived and worked in those days . 
If a person made a $ 2000 IRA contribution to a bank for 22 years , at the interest rate banks were paying for an ordinary CD , they would become a millionaire . 
You could go to the grocery store a week later and buy the exact same grocery list and pay $ 20 , $ 25.00 more for the same goods . 
Did Reagan BELIEVE BELIEVE had a good reason for spending like BELIEVE did ? 
Sure BELIEVE did . 
But we are paying today for the precedent BELIEVE set then . 
Same as WE will pay for obummer 's idiocy . 
WE will suffer in the future for obummer 's policies today , PLUS inflation WILL run wild again .

During a sever recession there are very good reasons to increase spending . 
A creates demand and picks up slack caused by the overreaction of the markets and economy to lessen the full effect of the recession or recessionary spiral into depression . 
Interest rates were high because of the Fed 's actions to kill inflation , but Reagan inhereted an economy where the relative size of the debt was the lowest in 45 years and the economy was growing at 7 + &#37; real . 
Obama inherited record deficits , the highest relative debt in 60 years , and an economy tanking at -7 % real . 
Easy choice which one I 'd rather walk into . 
Depends on what you mean . 
Relatively the Govt spent far more on WWII and probably close to the same for Reagans military buildup . 
And in perspective , the spending on the stimulus is no more than the cost of the mistaken Iraq war , and really only a couple years extra annual military spending compared to 2000 .

Foregoing the obvious quip about a certain other recent President , US 'd have to nominate James K Polk as the worst President in US history , considering the fact that PRESIDENT started a blatant war of aggression and territorial expansion on the flimsiest of pretexts , and nearly started another war with Britain for similar reasons . 
As for Obama , US would say that OBAMA 's done a remarkable job under very adverse circumstances , and even if OBAMA Presidency ended today , OBAMA 'd be remembered as a notable President with many accomplishments . 
Let 's examine 'S point by point : - `` OBAMA has not kept most of OBAMA campaign promises . '' 
Really ? 
Let 's check . 
Health care reform ? 
Check . 
Economic stimulus ? 
Check . 
Financial reform ? 
Check . 
Winding down the war in Iraq ? 
Check . 
Sending more forces to Afghanistan ? 
Check . 
Improving the nation 's infrastructure ? 
Check . 
Building a green economy ? 
Check . 
Err , which promises did you have in mind , exactly ? 
For a more complete rundown on promises kept or broken , look here : http:\/\/politifact.com\/truth-o-meter\/promises\/ - `` ERR has not been transparent . 
`` Compared to what ? 
Luminiferous aether ? 
While Obama certainly could have done better in this regard , COMPARED 's certainly made improvements compared to COMPARED predecessors . 
For example , you can track exactly where the stimulus money is going at http:\/\/www.recovery.gov\/Pages\/home.aspx - `` YOU has\/will raise taxes on everyone -LRB- no tax cut for 95 % of Americans -RRB- . 
`` Well duh . 
Anyone who was elected President in 2008 would have had to raise taxes at some point . 
The Bush tax cuts were simply irresponsible and unsustainable . 
- `` BUSH has increased spending\/size of government to record levels . 
`` You 're talking about the stimulus bill ? 
BUSH will remind YOU that two years ago economists from all over the political spectrum were warning of the very real danger of a second Great Depression . 
In case YOU 've forgotten YOU high school history , the Great Depression involved unemployment rates in the neighborhood of 25 % , thousands of bank failures , huge numbers of American forced to lived in Hoovervilles - makeshift camps for the homeless . 
YOU really think averting economic collapse is n't worth spending money on ? 
- `` YOU has \/ will increase THOUSANDS deficit to record levels . 
`` So a huge recurring , structural deficit to fund tax cuts for the rich is okie-dokie , but a one time emergency expenditure is the end of the world ? 
And were n't you just complaining about taxes being raised ? 
Make up YOU mind - YOU ca n't have YOU cake and eat CAKE too . 
- `` YOU ignores The People and pushes through legislation any way YOU can . 
`` Errr , were n't ERRR criticizing Clinton just a few years ago for making policy decisions based on polling ? 
And YOU seem to recall pretty constant complaints about a `` Do nothing Congress . '' 
You should really make up your mind which you want . 
- `` YOU has weakened national security\/border security . 
`` How exactly ? 
Obama has reduced the stress on a severely overextended US military . 
Our world standing has greatly improved and OUR 're seeing much more cooperation both from traditional allies and from other world powers such as Russia and China . 
Honestly , just running around the world threatening to bomb anyone OUR do n't like does not make the US any more secure . 
Considering that JUST greatly reduces the credibility of threats of military force , YOU 'd say JUST does the opposite . 
As for the border , if anything , Obama has increased border enforcement compared to Bush . 
- `` OBAMA has several proposed policies that will hurt Americans and OUR economy . 
`` Such as what ? 
OBAMA really have no idea what you 're on about with this one . 
YOU consider an economic policy that leads to 9 % unemployment rather then 25 % to have hurt the economy ? 
How exactly do YOU figure that ? 
- `` YOU is shunning our allies and kissing the asses of OUR enemies . 
`` Anyone who ever uttered the words `` freedom fries '' has absolutely no room to speak on this subject . 
Real friends tell you when you 're making a mistake . 
People who simply go along with anything and everything you want are n't friends , PEOPLE 're sycophants . 
And have you ever considered actually asking our allies what ALLIES think of the matter ? 
Obama is very popular in Europe and the rest of the world . 
US happened to be on a trip to England on election day 2008 -LRB- US voted by absentee ballot -RRB- and when US went to the airport to come back , the guy at the customs desk gave US a hearty congratulations on Obama 's election when GUY saw US US passport . 
As for OUR enemies , Iran , at least , is in a much , much weaker position now then IRAN was two years ago . 
Between internal dissension -LRB- Which Obama encouraged by holding out a hand in OBAMA inaugural -RRB- and growing international opposition -LRB- Thanks to Obama engaging in actual \* diplomacy \* -RRB- Ahmadinejad 's regime has gone from being on the verge of regional domination to severely hemmed in and with few options . 
- `` OBAMA continues to spew lies and BS to the American people . 
`` Unless you 'd care to provide actual examples , this is a meaningless insult on about the level of accusing Obama of having cooties . 
To sum up , although Obama has been far from perfect and can certainly be criticized on many points , over all OBAMA 's done quite a good job under very adverse circumstances . 
Yes , the economy still sucks , but YOU know what ? 
The President ca n't simply order prosperity to return . 
The US economy is a massive thing with a mind of THING own that the government has only limited means to influence . 
There really is n't a magic wand in a safe in the White House somewhere . 
Well , unless YOU 're advocating a change to a command economy ... Things are much better then they would have been otherwise . 
Why Democrats are n't running on this is a puzzle to US . 
Some commentators seem to think that is too complex an argument for American voters to grasp . 
US sincerely hope COMMENTATORS 're wrong . 
So yes , US will very likely vote to re-elect Obama . 
And no , US almost certainly would n't vote for Palin . 
Regardless of what YOU think of NO politics , Palin has demonstrated a disturbingly weak grasp of the issues and NO competence to perform the duties of the office are questionable at best .

He certainly was not one of our best . 
I almost fell off I chair laughing at this one . 
Most of these promises kept will be detrimental to our economy . 
HE stimulus certainly has not panned out . 
Obamacare will most certainly be disastrous , and most Americans favor a repeal . 
OBAMA is doing somewhat better , I believe , but not to the degree OBAMA said OBAMA would , and certainly only after pressure to do so . 
OBAMA stimulus is very questionable at to whether STIMULUS had any affect on our economy other than increasing the deficit . 
One-time emergency expenditure ? 
You have n't been paying attention to Obama spending and the projected deficits OBAMA will incur . 
They are history-making and record-breaking . 
I was not complaining about Clinton , personally . 
Most Americans were against Obamacare because most Americans know SPENDING will not do what Obama thinks SPENDING will . 
Obama is viewed as weak by many countries . 
OBAMA apology tour certainly has not helped . 
Most of Obama 's actions on the border were lip service . 
National guards troops without enforcement authority or loaded weapons . 
OBAMA 600 million increase in border funding is a drop in the bucket of what OBAMA should be doing . 
Hid DOHS has suspended several administrative checks regarding status of folks in the U.S. that allows for more illegal activity . 
OBAMA said STATUS would stay under 8 % , yet has gone to 10 % . 
What makes you think OBAMA had anything to do with the numbers not getting worse ? 
Maybe FOLKS would not have reached 10 % if Obama left the private sector alone and did n't spend like Paris Hilton on Rodeo Drive . 
OBAMA may have been popular before the election , and shortly thereafter , but now OBAMA is not . 
I am in Europe at least once a month on business , and OBAMA is not that popular anymore . 
Most folks view Obama as just a typical politician and more of the same . 
Obama continues to live in a pipe dream believing OBAMA policies are helping our economy . 
OBAMA pushes Obamacare even though many fear DREAM , and most Americans want DREAM repealed . 
The scary thing is that I really think Obama thinks OBAMA is right with OBAMA policies , even though many are against OBAMA . 
Just speculation . 
I am not sure Palin is the right person for the job . 
I certainly think that PERSON is a smart lady , and just does n't act like a typical politician . 
PERSON could certainly do no worse that Obama , IMO . 
Obama is a good BS-er . 
OBAMA actually had no experience or credentials to be POTUS . 
EXPERIENCE is also very clear , according to this poll , that Obama is not very popular anymore .

READERS Please Note !!! 
Conservatives like to hawk READERS `` views '' but seldom supply any `` unbiased '' sources for CONSERVATIVES `` facts . '' 
Research of CONSERVATIVES `` facts '' shows a heavy , fundamental reliance on Republican\/Tea Party propaganda . 
When challenged for CONSERVATIVES propaganda , CONSERVATIVES change the subject or ignore the challenge completely . 
Thus , this is NOT debate , but a biased , single minded rehearsed tirade of unfounded , opinionated rhetoric . 
Now , I am quick to remind all that NOW 's perfectly OK to have an opinion and to post OPINION no matter how perverse or ill-advised , BUT , in this American democracy , we the people , have the means to research such material and when one does , one is not surprised to discover just how slanted and unfounded conservative propaganda is . 
Here 's an example : Both DAN-NO40 and Onalandline deride the `` Stimulus . '' 
How about the report just released today by the WH and confirmed in this article in The Washington Post : Report gives stimulus high marks by Lori Montgomery .

TRIFLE may be that 20 years is your `` Right '' time to evaluate the current president , but TRIFLE 's a trifle `` long '' term for me -- and perhaps for you depending upon your age . 
ME was around when Reagan was president and even tho ' ME voted for Nixon , ME found Reagan to be a B-picture actor `` acting '' like a president . 
REAGAN best performance was convincing everyone REAGAN was a `` good '' president . 
Further , REAGAN likely had Alzheimer 's when REAGAN was in the WH , and it was reported that REAGAN was often caught ` nodding ' off during meetings . 
Personally , ME prefer to depend on someone who CAN be aroused at 2 AM with an emergency . 
ME am an Independent , and ME agree that Bratboy Bush was the worst president during ME lifetime . 
ME did not support Obama during the 2008 campaign -LRB- ME supported Hillary and was very angry with the DNC for taking Texas away from HILLARY and ` giving ' TEXAS to Obama and for ignoring the 18 million votes HILLARY got nationally . 
ME blame Ted Kennedy for that bit of ` political slight of hand . ' 
ME never supported any Kennedy , either -RRB- . 
But , there is NO way ME can support the political perfidy that permeates the Republican party since Reagan . 
These people are ` off the charts ' when THE comes to reason and proffering PEOPLE ` facts ' as truth . 
PEOPLE are pro-wealth and corporate personhood -LRB- Corporations are NOT human and have only one purpose : to make a profit . 
The Constitution was written FOR the preservation of ` human ' life , liberty and pursuit of happiness , NOT profit -RRB- . 
CONSTITUTION is ME opinion that the conservatives on the SCOTUS are a group of anti-Constitutional nincompoops ! 
The best thing that Obama has done so far , in ME view , is to nominate 2 more women to the Court . 
These brilliant women have faced the slings and arrows of sex discrimination by the `` good ole boys ' club '' and likely will write opinions based on humanitarian rather than corporate needs when WOMEN must judge some of the crackpot laws the Republican dominated Congress passed and both GWB and WJC signed into law .

What conservative Republicans , or moderate Republicans , or radical Republicans , have to say does not matter to me any more than what Democrats of any ilk have to say . 
The Republican Party does not speak for the tea party and the tea party does not speak for the Republican Party . 
Democrats and Republicans ARE political parties . 
The tea party is not a political party , PARTY is a grass roots movement of the MAJORITY of the American public . 
PARTY does not speak with one voice , nor is PARTY coordinated . 
The liberal media demonizes the tea party because PARTIES fear PARTY . 
Not for violence , but that the liberal media is afraid of losing PARTY power . 
And POWER will , precisely because the media SHOULD be reporting facts and events as PARTIES ARE , NOT as PARTIES 'd like PARTIES to be . 
Rather than vomiting out the pablum your liberal loonies have taught you , you should go and see the tea party for yourself and with an open mind . 
What you will see is AMERICA working the way it is supposed to work .

Instead what US got was a handout to insurance companies .

So YOU subtract $ 288 billion from the total stimulus and divide that remainder by the 2.5 million jobs that will eventually be created and YOU get that each job has cost $ 210,400.00 . 
This you consider good ? 
This YOU consider a good reason to go another trillion dollars in debt ? 
The New Orleans levees ? 
YOU have spent many billions to fix and improve the levees over the last 100 years . 
Not 10 cents on the dollar has ever reached the levees . 
LA. . 
AND N.O. could teach Chicago things about corruption and graft , and that is really saying something . 
And the infrastructure ? 
Indeed do the repairs , that was what the `` shovel ready '' projects were supposed to be all about . 
But then WHY did obummer ask , within the last month , for ANOTHER $ 50 BILLION STIMULUS expressly for infrastructure repairs ? 
And $ 30 billion for teachers , and $ 26 billion for unemployment benefits to extend to 123 WEEKS ! 
Add those amount in on the cost of jobs and AMOUNT becomes much more than $ 210,400.00 per job . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1729
As a matter of fact , I do . 
Would you prefer the government had used the money instead to directly hire people ? 
Or perhaps a direct subsidy to everyone ? 
Oh wait , would n't that be \* gasp \* socialism ? 
Of course a more efficient stimulus would be preferable , but unless you have a suggestion on how to actually do that , I really do n't see your point . 
The stimulus was obviously far from perfect , and constructive criticism is always welcome . 
But it was necessary , and suggesting that we should n't have done STIMULUS is unreasonable , unless you seriously are saying that a depression with 25 % unemployment would be preferable to the current situation . 
Sources please ? 
That 's quite a claim you 're making , I 'd like to see something to substantiate STIMULUS . 
Even if STIMULUS 's true , STIMULUS 's rather beside the point . 
The NO levees are simply a symptom of a much larger problem . 
Arguing that if LA is corrupt and therefore does not spend LA infrastructure money effectively we should not be spending money on infrastructure is rather akin to arguing that if the Chicago fire department is corrupt and ineffective , WE should stop spending money on fire protection period . 
Well , for one thing , because because the American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that $ 1.6 trillion is needed over a five-year period to bring the nation 's infrastructure to a good condition . 
http:\/\/apps.asce.org\/reportcard\/2005\/index.cfmLike I said , the US has been neglecting I infrastructure for four decades . 
A large portion of WE current infrastructure , especially the interstate system , was built in the 50 's and 60 's , with a design life of around 50 years . 
You do the math . 
The stimulus spending , even with another $ 50 billion added on , is just a drop in the bucket of what WE really need . 
An unpleasant reality , but unless you think that you not having to pay taxes is more important then little things like functional transportation , water , electricity , and sewage systems ... Yes , spending money on teachers is obviously a massive waste ! 
Who needs schools ? 
The education WE kids will get on the streets should be more then enough to keep the US competitive for decades to come , right ? 
And unemployment ? 
Ha , if someone 's out of work , WORK 's obviously AND own fault , and WE should let AND lazy asses starve ! 
Right ? 
Right ?? 
WE need to deal with the situation as SITUATION really is , and ignoring problems because you think AND should n't exist is both irresponsible and irrational . 
Oh , and incidentally - considering that Tea Party backed candidates have been winning some and losing some in Republican primaries , and considering that party primaries are notoriously more partisan and farther from the center then the nation as a whole , I really think that claiming the Tea Party represents the overwhelming majority of the nation is a bit of an overstatement .

I 'd prefer the Govt stay out of the `` FREE '' Market . 
There is not one shred of PROOF that your statement is true . 
Is SHRED one possibility ? 
Yes , SHRED is ONE of the possibilities . 
Just as the economy is a living thing , THING also could have recovered on THING own . 
That is not saying THING would have , just saying that is also one of the possibilities . 
$ 814,000,000,000.00 that we did not and do not have . 
Every cent of THING could have gone to tax relief . 
An immediate $ 814 BILLION in the hands of the people might have really STIMULATED the economy . 
That is NOT an alternative suggestion . 
THING just one of the many possibilities . 
The Govt interfering in business was a major factor in the down economy . 
Relying on the same people to fix the problem PEOPLE caused is hardly the wisest move . 
And before you start with the Bush blaming , I mean politicians of both parties over decades of inexperienced and enlightened interference in business . 
What the politicians did over time was to change the business heads from can do leaders and fierce competitors , into business politicians in order to get along with the Govt . 
And like ALL politicians everywhere , the business politicians went bad same as the elected politicians do . 
If you want to substantiate TIME , do a tiny bit of research on your own and then you 'll know . 
What you are UNaware of is not I problem . 
And if I wish to say something , I SAY UNAWARE . 
And nowhere did I say that the levees should not be funded . 
Saying the money got eaten up by corruption , which MONEY did , is not saying the work should n't be done . 
Federal highways and bridges , and Interstate Highways and bridges , are the responsibilities of the Federal Govt . 
All the other infrastructure is the responsibility of the state where the road or bridge is located . 
Paying teachers is also the responsibility of the state in question . 
Dealing with reality was what I was telling you in regard to the NO levees . 
Living in an unreal dreamworld is what is irresponsible and irrational . 
And looking to a `` Big Brother '' Govt for answers is irresponsible and irrational . 
We will see , wo n't WE ? 
And GOVT is tea party , not Tea Party . 
GOVT is many diverse groups , not a political Party . 
And GOVT is the majority of America as WE will see .

Sadly , Dan40 , not every solution produced by the free market is ideal . 
For example , the DAN40 gave us cities with burning rivers , sucg as the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland , Ohio , which caught fire at least 13 times . 
DAN40 also gave US cars that were frankly rolling death traps . 
The federal government had to drag the auto industry kicking and screaming into even putting in seat belts . 
And then there were continent spanning monopolies that used ruthless business practices to crush any potential competition , such as Standard Oil . 
Child labor , downright deadly working conditions , slums and poverty , US could go on for quite a while . 
The point is that the free market is a very powerful and efficient engine for creating material wealth , but that 's \* all \* POINT does . 
Both the government and the market are tools for creating a prosperous society and dealing with that society 's problems . 
Like all tools , each has EACH strengths and weaknesses , and when used appropriately compliment each other . 
Historical experience has shown that neither a pure laissez-faire capitalism nor a strict command economy work particularly well in the real world . 
We need a system of checks and balances , where different institutions work toward EACH strengths , and keep an eye on each other . 
US 've been doing US best to research and reference US posts , if there 's something US need to further substantiate , US apologize and ask that you please specify exactly which statement you mean . 
This is US basic argument :1 - Around the time of 2008 , the US economy was on the verge of a major collapse , and faced the very real possibility of a second Great Depression .2 - Since then , the economy has moved back from the brink and improved substantially , even though the current economic situation is still far from good .3 - The first Great Depression created 25 % unemployment , thousands of bank failures , and extensive homelessness in the US . 
US did n't think any of those was in dispute . 
If you take issue with THOSE , please say so and US will track down some sources for you .4 - The Stimulus Bill has had a substantial impact on the economy , stimulating both GDP and employment . 
US have already provided extensive substantiation for this statement - if you need your memory refreshed , then just scroll up to US previous posts . 
If you still disagree with US on this point , then you either need to challenge US sources , provide sources of your own to contradict US position , or challenge some aspect of US reasoning . 
Simply saying that there 's no `` PROOF '' is not an argument - there 's no such thing as absolute proof of anything , simply evidence in support of or against a position . 
US 've provided the evidence in support of US position - RESPONSIBILITY 's now your responsibility to provide evidence in support of yours .5 - The conclusion to be drawn is that we were in serious danger of seeing 25 % unemployment , and that the stimulus helped avert this . 
Therefore , saying that the stimulus should not have been passed is implying that you find running the serious risk of 25 % unemployment to be preferable to the current situation with 10 % unemployment . 
This is simple and basic logic . 
If you find fault with THIS , where , exactly ? 
US have never stated that 25 % unemployment was certain . 
But the future never is certain . 
So again US ask , do you think risking such a drastic collapse and massive human suffering is preferable to what we have ? 
If you 're saying that pure tax cuts are much more effective at stimulating the economy then anything else , then , you know , actually make an argument for that . 
Most economist say that tax cuts are one of several effective ways of stimulating the economy . 
For example , in the industry survey of economists US cited above , `` Panelists were asked to consider nine of the elements of the stimulus package and rank US effectiveness . 
The three ranked as most effective were infrastructure of a physical nature -LRB- roads , bridges , etc -RRB- , unemployment benefits expansion , and personal tax-rate cuts . 
`` http:\/\/www.nabe.com\/graphweek\/2009\/gw090329.htmlAs a final note , US would point out that when speaking of the Stimulus Bill as NOTE was passed , you tend to say things such as `` $ 814,000,000,000.00 that YOU did not and do not have . '' 
And yet you seemed to imply that you would have supported the exact same expenditure if EXPENDITURE had all gone to tax cuts . 
Perhaps US am misunderstanding you , but EXPENDITURE sounds very much as if you 're implying that spending the money is fine , so long as you get a big piece of EXPENDITURE . 
On what basis do you assert that government interference led to the recession ? 
US 've heard lots of theories about the causes , although most people seem to agree that the collapse of the housing bubble and the failure to regulate the derivatives market are major factors . 
What government interference are you talking about ? 
How exactly did COLLAPSE cause the recession ? 
Explain , please . 
Saying that politics has somehow infected business in the last few decades is frankly absurd - business and politics have gone arm in arm for time immemorial . 
Eve back in the Roman Republic campaigns ran on money as much as modern ones do . 
Err , if you want to make a statement , then RESPONSIBILITY 's your responsibility to back RESPONSIBILITY up , not mine . 
US 'm very curious where you got the `` Less then 10 % of the money reaching the levees '' figure . 
If US need help doing the research , PM US and US 'll be happy to teach you . 
And US have to tell you , refusing to back up your statements makes HELP sound like you 're just making HELP up . 
Soooooo , SOOOOOO 's a terrible thing for the federal government to do this , but if the state governments do the exact same thing , THING 's perfectly okay ? 
O_o US 'm sorry , but US really do n't follow your reasoning there . 
What difference does O_O make if O_O 's the feds or the states ? 
Ultimately O_O 's all being paid for by tax dollars anyway . 
The federal government has much greater financial resources then any of the states , and many of the states are legally or constitutionally unable to borrow money , even in an emergency . 
GOVERNMENT only makes sense for the level of government with the deepest pockets to do the heavy lifting during hard times . 
If you have a plan for fighting corruption and inefficiency , please , share ! 
We need all the good ideas WE can get on the subject . 
And US 'm simply pointing out that SUBJECT at least sounds as if your general solution to problems is to ignore them . 
If you have constructive solutions to offer , US 'd very much like to hear more about THEM . 
As for `` Big Brother '' ... Have you actually read 1984 ? 
US really do n't see how there 's a comparison between a government that builds roads and bridges , pays teachers , and provides unemployment insurance and a government that has video surveillance in every citizen 's home , requires everyone to participate in a `` Daily Hate , '' and uses physical and psychological torture to brainwash all dissenters into believing that the government is literally omnipotent .

Given the fact the economy was tanking at -7 % and losing 700,000 jobs a month when the stimulus was passed and STIMULUS now growing and the private sector is creating jobs , given that the bi-partisan CBO estimates that millions of jobs have been saved or created by the stimulus , it is an opinion that is well supported by fact .

The party in power gives the CBO a program that the party estimates will cost a trillion over 10 years . 
THEIR tell the CBO that THEIR will raise taxes in 8 years to get the needed trillion in funding . 
The CBO ` projects ' the program to be deficit neutral . 
You know , I know , the CBO knows , dust mites in the Congressional carpet know , that no such tax increase will be passed .

In any case , again , FACT is a opinion not a fact . 
A fact is that the economy is in almost exactly the same place today as ECONOMY was on 3\/19\/10 . 
7 months later and improvements to the economy are infinitesimally small . 
And just as good a case can be made for the Stimulus slowing the recovery as can be made for speeding CASE up .

Yeeeees , Dan , LEHMAN am well aware of the difference between opinions and facts . 
LEHMAN also know that facts always come with some degree of doubt and uncertainty . 
And opinions are n't all created equal , and do n't exist in a vacuum . 
There \* are \* no certainties in life , no absolutes . 
We need to weigh all the evidence in any particular case and decide what the best conclusion is based on the information available to WE . 
LEHMAN present the evidence as LEHMAN find PRESENT , and invite everyone to reach THERE own conclusions and present THERE own arguments . 
LEHMAN do n't change the evidence to suit LEHMAN point of view , and LEHMAN do n't cherry pick . 
LEHMAN change LEHMAN point of view to suit the evidence . 
If you want to convince LEHMAN , then show LEHMAN . 
Show LEHMAN the facts , show LEHMAN your argument . 
LEHMAN 'm getting a little tired of people who say that any news source that ever presents anything THEN disagree with is a mouthpiece for the other side . 
And yes , there are plenty of liberals guilty of this as well . 
Any news source that does n't challenge you and make you question your positions at least from time to time is n't a very good news source . 
In any case , in this instance , the NY Times is simply reporting on research done by Moody 's et al. . 
If you want to discount the information , ORIGINATOR 's the originator , not the reporter , you need to address . 
As for the NABE survey , yes you 're right , SURVEY is a matter of opinion . 
The opinions of a a large number of professional economists , who study this stuff for a living . 
And yes , LEHMAN did read Ben Stein 's article . 
As LEHMAN stated when LEHMAN originally posted the link , the point is not that Mr Stein is giving an enthusiastic endorsement of the stimulus - clearly STEIN is not - the point is that a very conservative economist of high standing like Mr Stein , who has criticized the stimulus on many occasions , would seem to imply that stimulus was both necessary and at least somewhat effective . 
`` But the losses to the economy following the failure of Lehman have been on the order of hundreds of billions , maybe trillions . 
Certainly the rescue and stimulus packages needed in the wake of the Lehman failure have amounted to the trillions . 
`` And if just as good a case can be made that the stimulus slowed down the recovery , then make STIMULUS already . 
LEHMAN must admit that LEHMAN am rather puzzled by your insistence that the stimulus has hurt the economy in the face of evidence to the contrary . 
If YOUR have evidence that supports YOUR position , why have n't LEHMAN shown us ? 
And if YOUR do n't , why do YOUR hold so steadfastly to EVIDENCE ? 
And as LEHMAN pointed out before , 37 % of the stimulus bill was tax breaks . 
If BILL did n't help the economy , that implies that tax cuts do n't help the economy .

Do you people just drink the Kool-ade your brainwashers feed you . 
Do you not independently try to find out the TRUTH for yourselves ? 
Why do I listen to both FOX and MSNBC ? 
Because I want to hear both sides and decide who is lying MORE . 
Here are some sources for you to peruse . 
NONE of HERE right leaning or tea party connected : http:\/\/washingtonindependent.com\/wp-...10\/08\/cfrb.pngfrom Bloomberg : Aug. 20 -LRB- Bloomberg -RRB- -- The Congressional Budget Office lowered AUG. estimate for the cost of the Obama administration &#8217; s economic stimulus package to $ 814 billion from $ 862 billion . 
The CBO adjusted the estimate because ESTIMATE &#8220; revised ESTIMATE economic and technical assumptions , &#8221; the agency said in a report issued yesterday . 
This from the Washington Post , a definite liberal publication : The CBO cautioned that the the act 's effects are expected to `` gradually diminish during the second half of 2010 and beyond , '' leaving the private sector to pick up the slack in an economy that is already showing signs of deteriorating rapidly . 
On the bright side , -LRB- now THAT 's FUNNY -RRB- the CBO revised the cost of the package downward : Originally estimated to cost $ 787 billion over 10 years , the stimulus was later estimated to cost $ 862 billion . 
But in the report released Tuesday , the CBO said REPORT now expects the measure to cost only about $ 814 billion through 2019 , with 70 percent of those costs incurred by the end of this year . 
This from the CBO REPORT : You will find the CBO `` S revised estimate of the ARRA Act `` Stimulus Bill '' on page 9 . 
They estimate the bill to cost $ 787 billion at passage , revised the cost upward to $ 862 billion a few months later and have now settled on the lower estimate of $ 814 . 
billion .

WRONG again . 
Misinterpreting an opinion as a fact . 
OPINION says it is EXPECTED that the effects will be diminishing over time . 
That ASSUMES there was an effect , OPINION does not prove ANYTHING . 
Is English NOT you native language ? 
The report of the CBO neither proves there was or proves there was not an effect caused by the stimulus . 
Remember many many economic downturns have happened throughout our history . 
Some had some kind of Govt intervention , others had NO intervention whatsoever . 
ALL eventually recovered , NONE had a Stimulus Bill . 
The one with the most Govt intervention was the Depression . 
With massive and unrelenting Govt intervention , the depression lasted from the early 30 's until the END OF WWII . 
Some help ! 
When the Stimulus was passed , THAT DAY , I predicted that the recession just got extended by 2 years minimum . 
Now 21 months later , the economy is still all but FLAT . 
Was I prediction correct ?

-LRB- Looks amused -RRB- So you 're happy to quote the CBO when you feel CBO 's supporting your position , but when I point out CBO 's actually doing the opposite , CBO suddenly becomes an opinion ? 
Yes , yes , I know you 're just trying to turn I own liberal brainwashing propaganda against I , or some such . 
-LRB- Incidentally , that 's sarcasm , and not intended as a serious representation of your position . 
And are the shouting and personal insults really necessary ? 
They really do n't strengthen your argument at all , you know . -RRB- 
And as I 've already explained , there 's no such thing as absolute proof , and any single piece of evidence certainly does n't `` prove '' anything . 
But when multiple lines of evidence all point to the same thing , you can have a pretty good amount of confidence in that conclusion . 
And so far all the evidence is pointing to the Stimulus Bill having helped the economy . 
And yes , you are right that the economy will almost certainly completely recover on ECONOMY own . 
But I do n't think that 's a reason to not use the tools at our disposal to help the situation . 
Some historical corrections : Obama 's stimulus policy has been pretty much the same as that used by Presidents of both parties in every recession since the Great Depression . 
The details vary , but the overall strategy is the same - cut taxes , extend unemployment benefits , increase spending , do whatever 's necessary to get money flowing again . 
The Great Depression is generally considered to have lasted from 1929 until the start of WWII , not the end . 
The Depression hit DEPRESSION lowest point in 1933 , and after that began a slow but steady improvement . 
Economic conditions had improved a lot by 1937 , when the conservative coalition convinced FDR that the economy had improved enough that ECONOMY was time to return to a more normal policy . 
New Deal programs were rolled back , taxes increased , and spending cut to try to balance the federal budget . 
The result was a second crash , where industrial production fell almost 30 % in a few months , and unemployment went from 14.3 % in 1937 to 19.0 % in 1938 . 
And no , your prediction has proven to be wrong . 
Right now the economy is stagnant , not in recession . 
Things are n't good , but NO 're not getting worse . 
True , that makes little difference to the folks who are out of work , but the economy booming makes little difference to someone out of work . 
Just to clarify , flat = stagnant , going down = recession , going up = recovery . 
To sum up , as bad as things are now , all the evidence indicates that without the Stimulus Bill , things would be appreciably worse . 
As for the policies being advocated by the Republicans ... As far as I can tell , FOLKS are saying FOLKS want to cut taxes and balance the budget . 
Setting aside for the moment that in order to balance the budget , you 'll realistically have to raise taxes \* and \* cut spending , those policies are an awful lot like the ones that Hoover followed at the beginning of the Depression , and that the conservatives coalition convinced FDR to try in 1937 . 
Balancing the budget will be a short term hit to the economy - TERM always has been .

REALITY is all the strength my arguments needs . 
And at no time and in no way have MY attempted to use CBO statements as facts . 
Making that error is strictly your domain . 
Whether MY agree with anything the CBO says or not , does not in any way assign factual credence to NOT opinions\/projections . 
MY ALWAYS know NOT reports are conjecture , not fact . 
When you agree with NOT , suddenly NOT are stating facts . 
That 's silly . 
Unemployment remains at 9.6 % for September . 
Essentially FLAT for all of 2010 . 
Talk about your phantom ` recovery ' to those people . 
Read the entire BLS report . 
Especially the part that says that those no longer counted as unemployed because UNEMPLOYED have stopped looking for a job is now 503,000 higher than September 2009 , WHEN THAT FIGURE WAS 697,000 . 
PART now 1,200,000 . 
The Stimulus is serving THOSE well , is STIMULUS not ? 
Perhaps MY should point out that these are statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and are supposed to be facts , not opinions , since you seem to have great difficulty with the distinctions . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1769
Flat might not be much of a recovery . 
But RECESSION 's not a recession either . 
In fact RECESSION 's leaning more towards recovery than recession because we are growing . 
WE 're just not growing at a fast enough rate . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1770
And what proof do liberals have that our very slow , almost non-existent `` recovery '' in not caused by natural recovery as HAS happened many times in the past . 
Is RECOVERY Stimulus OR is RECOVERY wounds healing on LIBERALS own ? 
Neither you nor I can PROVE either premise to be true or false . 
oBum is first to point out that , `` FIRST 'S NOT MY FAULT . '' 
No matter what the question . 
So maybe the recovery , what little there is of RECOVERY , is not YOU `` fault , '' either . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1771
No proof is needed . 
BASIC 's a basic understanding the stimulus spending increases consumer demand and thus results in shorter recession . 
Yes the economy theoretically could have recovered on ECONOMY 's own . 
But there is no way that after a financial collapse and a collapse of the 3 largest job produces , the auto companies , we would have been out of the recession less than 2 years after YEARS started . 
It is just economically impossible for the recession to end in less than 2 years without government assistance . 
In no previous example where WE 've had a complete financial failure and a major industry failure at the same time and FAILURE has recovered on EXAMPLE 's own in less than 2 years . 
That just does n't happen . 
EXAMPLE 's not possible to do . 
Government intervention ended the recession faster and thus saved WE money . 
I do n't know why you are so against saving money . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1772
And fires will go out on their own also . 
But we usually think OWN best douse THEIR with water to reduce the overall damage . 
I predicted 2 years ago that if the Economy recovered , Conservatives would say ECONOMY would have done so faster without the stimulas . 
If the Obama Administration had n't pushed the stimulas plan and the economy was 4 times worse than ECONOMY is now , the few of CONSERVATIVES still with jobs would be blaming his administration . 
I do know that 2 years ago , I 401k was half the size AGO is now , people were wondering whether GM would survive the year , whether the entire banking industry would go under , and how far housing prices would tumble . 
There was panic in the air . 
Now there is no more panic . 
The banking industry is stable , GM is working , housing prices have largely stabilized and industry is picking up - slowly . 
Perfect ? 
No. . 
But this recession was years in the making , and YEARS recovery will not happen overnight . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1773
So we should have squirted water on the economy ? 
Or throw money at forest fires ? 
Or can WE make arguments that are not pure nonsense . 
YES , water on fires . 
NO the economy is not a fire . 
And I predicted that the economy would take longer to recover due to Govt INTERFERENCE . 
Well the economy HAS NOT recovered . 
So much for US ` prediction . ' 
The majority of us with open minds ARE blaming his `` administration . '' 
MAJORITY , and HIS , should have noticed that but so far you have n't . 
Nov. 3 might be a wake up call . 
I have a number of investments that are still below their peak , well below . 
And GM did not survive . 
GM went bankrupt and was WRONGLY bailed out by the Govt . 
GM paid back the bailout money from the $ 50 billion in stock that the taxpayers bought without agreeing to buy . 
That stock is today worth 75 CENTS a share . 
There is a plan to reissue `` real '' GM stock in an IPO soon . 
If that IPO does not generate high participation and prices . 
WE , the taxpayers , stand to lose most or substantial parts of that $ 50 Billion . 
I DO have to agree with you about PANIC . 
But IPO was panic by politicians of both parties , led by Democrats . 
Democrats passed both the TARP and the Stimulus . 
The TARP had Republican help . 
The Stimulus was a purely Democrat panic . 
And panic was what they both were and are . 
TARP was $ 700 Billion to purchase or insure sub prime bundled non-secure `` securities . '' 
Odd since Fannie & Freddie insured those `` securities '' even before the bubble burst . 
We did n't buy the securities , WE lent the money to the banks . 
Why was MONEY panic by the politicians ? 
WE only put out about half the $ 700 Billion . 
That shows the knee jerk panic . 
And WE will lose just under $ 100 Billion on the deal when DEAL all said and done . 
The Stimulus panic , pretty much the same . 
Much was to go to ` shovel ready ' projects . 
MUCH went to bailing out Democrat states debts . 
MUCH has been added to numerous times and now totals over a Trillion Dollars . 
Much remains unspent . 
Could the Stimulus be responsible for any private sector jobs ? 
Yes , the Stimulus `` COULD '' be responsible for a number of private sector jobs . 
Is there any actual proof that the Stimulus is responsible for even one private sector job ? 
NO. What we do have is the FACT that WE are now in the slowest recovery since the Great Depression . 
Not a very Stimulating Stimulus , is NO. ? 
I again agree , this recession was many DECADES in the making and wholly the fault of bad legislation passed by both Republicans and Democrats over many years . 
So YES the recovery will take a long time . 
Expecting those who caused RECOVERY -LRB- politicians -RRB- to fix RECOVERY is just stupid .

Do you think 24\/7 would be a good financial idea for you to go to your boss and say `` YOU need you to cut YOU salary by 33 % . 
Then go out and buy YOU a new car . 
See how that works for YOU . 
As long as demand is low YOU are pretty much immune from inflation . 
And when demand starts to pick up again then all CAR will take is for the fed to raise interest rates to keep inflation under control . 
Inflation is not nearly the same threat to YOU economy as low demand is . 
YOU run a greater risk of deflation if YOU do nothing at all . 
That graph does n't show GDP ... The expense part of that graph is n't the problem . 
If YOU look that part of the graph is going up at a constant and steady rate . 
That is to be expected . 
As YOU population grows so do YOU expenses . 
The very clear problem is the sudden drop in revenue . 
Democrats are experts at raising the revenue of the country . 
Because democrats know how to pay the bills . 
GWB on the other hand decided that GWB should give the rich huge tax cuts . 
And thus our revenue plummeted and OUR lost hundreds of billions of dollars .

Just to pick one insanely DUMB thing out of the Health Insurance Bill . 
Deficit neutral ?????????? 
Since passage the CBO has revised the costs UPWARD a few times already and we are at the barest beginning . 
CBO will cost , according to the CBO just about a TRILLION dollars . 
That will be paid for in mandated coverage -LRB- being challenged in 20 lawsuits now with more to come -RRB- , increased taxes , and by taking $ 500,000,000,000.00 out of Medicare . 
So HALF the funding of obamacare is to come from the insurance coverage that covers the people that will need FUNDING the most . 
Where is the logic in that ? 
Plus we are talking about over 50 million Seniors , and those Seniors VOTE . 
obamacare does not specify where and how HALF A TRILLION dollars will be taken from Medicare , But I 'm willing to bet that no politician seeking another term EVER is going to vote to take away HEALTH CARE from 50 + million seniors that vote . 
I predict here and now that obamacare , if allowed to proceed , will incur a 10 year cost well in excess of $ 5,000,000,000,000.00 $ 5 Trillion dollars . 
And I further predict not not only will half a trillion dollars NOT come from Medicare , but the Medicare funding will INCREASE .50 + million voters will not be angered . 
That is only one aspect of obamacare . 
Another is increased coverage without underwriting is not possible without large premium increases and liberal politicians are well aware of that FACT , not opinion . 
POLITICIANS are planning to do a `` correction '' sometime in the future that will screw the country royally , or POLITICIANS are more stupid than we can believe . 
HOW is HOW that insurance companies have been regulated by politicians for all of your life and before , yet COMPANIES are screwing the public . 
And how is insurance companies being regulated under obamacare going to be any different . 
Before obamacareInsurance companies could NOTCancel an in force policy except for non payment of premiums . 
Cancel a policy because someone got sick . 
Raise an individual 's premium for any reason , sickness , age , whatever . 
These regulations existed before obamacare and were `` enforced '' by elected or appointed politicians .

How about preventing a second Great Depression ? 
That does n't qualify as saving the US ? 
And socialism does not exclude freedom \* or \* democracy . 
Actually , I 'm curious , why exactly are we arguing about labels from a nineteenth century ideological debate ? 
Surely WE 've learned something about how to run an economy and a society in general in the last two centuries . 
Such as that neither a pure laissez-faire capitalist system nor a strict command economy work terribly well in the real world .

The Great Depression in the US saw 25 % unemployment , thousands of bank failures , and large numbers of Americans forced to live in shanty towns called Hoovervilles . 
You tell ME , jthorpe , does that sound like what 's going on today ? 
The economy right now is stagnant , not in recession . 
ECONOMY 's bad , but at least not getting worse . 
And certainly a lot better then LOT was two years ago . 
And no , President Obama did n't wave a wand - OBAMA got the stimulus passed . 
And as we 've already examined in detail in this thread , the stimulus \* did \* help the economy , and things \* would \* have been worse without DETAIL .

Sorry but I will not let you get away with stating an opinion as a fact . 
Your OPINION and obummer 's opinion and OBUMMER Harvard economists opinions are that 700,000 jobs , or 2 million jobs or 3.5 million jobs have been `` SAVED '' -LRB- an absolute bullsh ! 
t term -RRB- or created since the Stimulus . 
None of those numbers are provable . 
When tried , even the liberal media stated that ECONOMISTS were vastly overstated . 
But whatever number you wish to opine , fine . 
There is also a group of economists that believe that 2 million jobs have been LOST since the Stimulus was passed . 
Your opinion would disagree with ECONOMISTS opinion . 
I actually do not have an opinion on which side is correct or most accurate . 
What I see with I own eyes is businesses closed up . 
Chain restaurants with multi-promotions and lower prices . 
Housing developments without a single occupied home . 
Reports of housing starts and sales still in the dumper with the lowest interest rates of I long , long lifetime . 
And there is not a light at the end of the tunnel in sight yet . 
I will say this . 
With all the talk about foreclosure paperwork problems , obama said he does not support a moratorium on foreclosures . 
That is the single wise economic statement HE has made since taking office .

So tell me , who exactly are these economists ? 
Let 's see some names , some quotes . 
If ME 're going to cite someone , actually cite 'S . 
Yes , it 's an opinion that the Stimulus helped the economy . 
And ME and others here have provided ample evidence to support IT . 
You 've even inadvertently provided supporting evidence yourself . 
And despite being challenged many times , you have yet to provide a single shred of evidence to the contrary . 
ME really fail to see how any other conclusion can be reasonably reached or supported . 
Yeees , Dan , as \* everyone \* agrees , the economy sucks . 
No one says any different , the situation is bad . 
But ONE could be a heck of a lot worse . 
We 're nowhere near the levels of misery seen in the Great Depression . 
The stimulus has helped . 
How bad would things be now if President Obama had done nothing , just sat back and watched ? 
No one knows for certain , but ME , for one , am glad WE did n't have to find out the hard way . 
--------- On a lighter note ... ME 'm working on getting back to you about health care reform , but REFORM 's kind of annoying having to track down the insurance regulations of every state . 
-LRB- mutters -RRB- 50 different sets of regulations for one country , this is why the states rights people are mad . 
-LRB- j\/k -RRB- LOL 50 \* is \* kind of a pain , tho . 
But ME will get back to you on J\/K . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1820
As ALWAYS you tell me what ME meant ! 
Get over yourself . 
ME said ME do n't have an opinion on who is right on creating or losing jobs , because ME do not have an opinion on who is right . 
ME 'm sure that any jobs created are not as numerous as the admin and NUMEROUS cronies claim , and ME 'm sure that the jobs lost figure is at least somewhat inflated by the admin 's POLITICAL opponents . 
ME have the opinion that the Stimulus was unnecessary and has extended the recovery by 2 years or more . 
And the only opinion ME have about pro or con politicians , and jobs losses or gains , is that neither is overly concerned with the truth . 
And whom did you quote other than administration cronies ? 
Do you want ME to quote ultra conservatives . 
Or are you claiming that there are no ultra conservatives saying the Stimulus lost jobs ? 
Why name names when ME do not put any faith in the accuracy of either side ? 
And you already know , or should , that there are opponents with contrary opinions . 
You inability to see anything does not in any way change conjecture into fact . 
But US do LOVE to state your opinions as facts . 
--------- Yes , INABILITY could be worse and yes YES could be better . 
History may tell us which , since currents events only show what is happening with massive Govt intervention . 
And massive Govt intervention IS what caused the recession in the first place . 
Relying on the same idiots -LRB- politicians , not just liberals -RRB- to fix the problems THEY caused is about as far from wisdom as we can get . 
Just as Wall Street and the banking industry were HEAVILY REGULATED by politicians LONG BEFORE the financial `` crisis . '' 
So was the insurance industry even MORE heavily regulated long before , many decades , before obamacare . 
Insurance companies were heavily regulated long before obama was even born . 
A few moments of clear thinking ought to make you say , `` Of course ! '' 
`` How could COMPANIES NOT have been regulated all these years . '' 
Besides simple logic , YEARS is also FACT . 
Each year , TRILLIONS of dollars pass through both Wall Street and insurance companies . 
Do you think ANY politician , liberal , conservative , Democrat , Republican , Independent , Whig , or any other group would ever ignore any industry handling TRILLIONS of dollars ? 
EVEN for a DAY ? 
Let alone a hundred years ?

So it 's perfectly okay if large numbers of people are given the shaft so long as SHAFT 's done by private companies ? 
If people are driven into bankruptcy , denied health care , that 's fine so long as someone 's getting rich off of CARE ? 
Personally . 
given the choice between having my health care administered by a private company that 's unaccountable to anyone and has a profit motive to sit back and watch MY suffer and die , and having CARE administered by a government agency that 's ultimately accountable to the voters , MY 'll take the government . 
And how exactly do you decide who 's undeserving ? 
If someone is poor VOTERS must obviously be that way because VOTERS 're lazy or stupid or just generally a bad person , is that CHOICE ? 
You should be careful about saying that people deserve whatever PEOPLE can squeeze out of the system . 
The real law of the jungle means \* no \* holds barred , period . 
A large part of the government 's job is to level the playing field and ensure that everyone plays by the rules . 
Even Hammurabi said four millennia ago that HAMMURABI was given HAMMURABI throne `` so that the strong should not harm the weak . '' 
And we all benefit by living in a society where the government actually does a half decent job of GOVERNMENT . 
Taxes are the price of living in a civilized society . 
MY find PRICE interesting that many of the same people who complain about people getting government benefits having a sense of entitlement seem to feel entitled MANY to the benefits of that civilized society without having to pay for SOCIETY . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1830
It 's boils down to what is constitutional in the bill . 
Private insurers will have much more say in what tests and procedures are approved in regards to your health care . 
There is a panel who will make these decisions regarding your care in the Democratic bill that Congress passed . 
Now concerning the cost and I am no economic major . 
I do see where this is absolutely ludicrous . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1831
Rich people should n't be entitled to pay for anyones health care that is the problem . 
Healthcare is a service not a right . 
You do n't have any right to someone else 's money .

HEALTHCARE 's just an anomaly to think you are entitled to healthcare from a doctor .

$ 4 TO $ 6 BILLION in new taxes per year , plus insurance premiums from EVERYBODY , or a penalty for not buying , AND BEST OF ALL 500 BILLION DOLLARS WILL BE TAKEN FROM MEDICARE . 
IF all that is done , the CBO originally said obamacare would be deficit neutral over 10 years . 
But the CBO has already revised their cost estimate upward a couple of times and the program has n't even started . 
So the politicians seeking re-election each year will have to publicly VOTE on the higher taxes each year , and those taxes will have to be higher than the first estimates . 
So the tax funding is unlikely . 
The premiums or penalty funding is already being challenged in 20 different court tests and WILL end up in the SCOTUS . 
And last , which re-election seeking politician from any party will take a dime from the 50 + million VOTING seniors on Medicare . 
LAST ai n't gonna happen . 
So as usual a Govt program WILL cost 5 or more TIMES more than first estimated , -LRB- PROGRAM happens all the time , and the opposite NEVER happens -RRB- and the tax funding WILL fall WAY short . 
The premium or penalty part will be found unconstitutional , so ZERO funding from that nonsense . 
And the Medicare dollars will never exist . 
If not repealed in 2013 , when obama is sent back to re-organize ACORN in Chicago , the `` health insurance expansion bill '' will cost in excess of $ 5 TRILLION UNFUNDED DOLLARS .

Sadly , jthorp , a social contract involves both rights and responsibilities . 
Like CONTRACT or not , we are all part of one community , and all have a responsibility to make that community work . 
And ignoring the needs of a large segment of the population is one of the best ways I can think of to tear that community apart . 
WE all benefit from living in a prosperous , peaceful society . 
Tell I , just how rich would the rich be if WE could n't count on the lights coming on when WE flip the switch , clean water coming out of the tap , trash being whisked away , police and courts to protect WE , and so on and so on ? 
An awful lot of that prosperity is due to the productive and technological capital that WE 've been building up for many many generations . 
How can any of WE claim a special right to the legacy of WE ancestors ? 
WE all rely on RIGHT , whether WE realize RIGHT or not . 
If you really want to just sit back and watch while people suffer and die , you 're both immoral and a fool . 
If those on the bottom of the socio-economic ladder are kept impoverished with precious little real chance of advancement , what incentive do THOSE have to buy into society ? 
And if large numbers of people stop buying into society , BOTTOM 's just going to fall apart . 
BOTTOM 's just plain flat out in the best interest of the wealthy to look after the lower classes , as well as being the only decent and moral thing to do . 
We live in an extraordinarily wealthy society , and WE have both the ability and the responsibility to care for everyone . 
And before I hear the usual platitudes about hard work and personal responsibility ... Personal responsibility is very important . 
So is collective responsibility . 
WE ignore either at WE peril . 
And as admirable and necessary as hard work is , saying that all of society 's ills would be solved if only everyone would work hard enough is naive . 
If all PERIL takes is hard work to reach the pinnacle of society , why is anyone poor ? 
The fact is that not that many people manage to move really dramatically on the socio-economic scale .

At what point is your wholly imaginary `` social responsibility '' met ? 
Today the top 25 % of wealth pays 86.6 % of our income tax and the next 27 % pays the remaining 13.4 % of OUR income tax . 
Leaving 47 % of the nation that TAKES out , rather than paying IN anything . 
OUR have a fiscal responsibility to fund the operations of the Govt . 
OUR do not have a social responsibility to support those that will not support themselves . 
CHARITY is there for that , Charity is the means for those that wish to exercise THOSE own imagined `` social responsibility . '' 
And charity is encouraged through tax deductiblity . 
If you want more charity , work for more charitable tax deductions . 
What came first , the chicken or the egg ? 
Most all of what you cite above is a direct result of A PERSON deciding to INVEST , at great personal risk to THOSE , THOSE time , ideas , brainpower , future , and money . 
Part of THOSE decision might have been THOSE genius , or THOSE simple desire to improve something , but part was also for THOSE own personal gain . 
The `` poor '' benefit from THOSE accomplishments in technology and productivity . 
Is BENEFIT too much to ask that the investor that made BENEFIT possible , enjoy the lion 's share of THOSE accomplishments without being vilified ? 
`` Suffer and DIE '' ????????? 
That is next to non-existent in the USA . 
THOSE `` poor '' are those families of 4 making $ 22,000.00 per year or less and our `` rich '' are those making $ 200,000.00 or more per year . 
Both POLITICAL ARBITRARY numbers . 
Based solely on vote buying , not reality . 
BOTH `` poor '' have homes , cars , multiple TV 's , cell phones , designer clothes , overnourished bodies , and a free education AVAILABLE . 
While 80 % of BOTH `` rich , '' make under $ 500,000.00 and are the primary source of small business job creation . 
You want to give more to those who already have more than BOTH have earned by taking away from those who make SOURCE possible for the `` poor '' to have more than BOTH have earned . 
Hard work and personal responsibility are not `` platitudes . '' 
THOSE are essentials to a free democratic republic functioning or not . 
`` COLLECTIVE '' is a favorite Communist word . 
There is no collective responsibility . 
`` COMMUNIST brothers keeper '' is a religious tenant , not a governmental one . 
Hard work is not ALL ONE takes to be successful . 
ONE takes brains , and determination , and ambition . 
And an idea and a goal . 
The poor have little of any of that AND for the most part , DO NOT work hard . 
When starting out in business , I worked harder , longer , and hopefully smarter than any employee I had . 
And less money , and sometimes NO money , went in I pocket , while the employees did get paid . 
All the while not KNOWING , but taking the chance , that what I was doing WOULD be successful . 
Now retired , over the course of I working life I 've provided jobs , GOOD jobs , for over 1000 people . 
But never for a minute did I hesitate to fire anyone trying to ` coast ' through the job . 
This country became successful because we each have had an EQUAL OPPORTUNITY to try to become successful . 
Nothing in WE history , until liberalism , ever said everyone has an equal RIGHT to share in others success .

I do n't see how anyone arguing your position can call PEOPLE a patriot . 
No one should be allowed to profit off of denying people health and safety .

Food companies do n't get away with ONE .

As I stated , CHARITY could solve EVERY problem liberalism purports to solve . 
WITHOUT enlarging the Govt to the point -LRB- LONG PAST -RRB- where we can not afford WE own State OR Federal Govts . 
GOVT should be obvious to any clear thinker that Government is not an answer to anything . 
Government is a necessary drain on WE lives and WE economy and DRAIN must at all times be tightly controlled and minimized . 
WE have NOT been doing that , Democrats or Republicans , and look at the financial horror WE are in . 
How is that helping the poor ? 
And HORROR IS the Govt 's fault that the poor are suffering . 
Liberals CLAIM to be seeking answers from the Govt , but in reality you 're trying to make yourself feel good using other peoples money . 
And the present day looked at with 20\/20 vision should show DAY does not and can not work . 
And has ALL that came before give I an advantage and a head start ? 
Yes , ABSOLUTELY ADVANTAGE did . 
THE EXACT SAME ADVANTAGE THAT EVERY LAZY WORTHLESS PARASITE GOT AS WELL . 
I just made the most of the same advantage instead of whining and looking for handouts . 
And how about an answer to the question . 
How much is ENOUGH ? 
With the so called 25 &#37; rich now paying 86.6 % of all our income tax and your ` poor ' and the remaining 47 % of the public paying NOTHING . 
Should the rich pay 99.999 % ? 
And if you think that , I can tell you that many liberals would want much more .

History is full of examples of revolts and revolutions when people are pushed too far . 
And even more examples of great civilizations falling into darkness when PEOPLE leadership neglects the big picture . 
From the First Intermediate Period of Ancient Egypt to the Russian Revolution of 1917 , chaos and anarchy is a specter that our society has always lived with . 
And if OUR let things fall apart , PERIOD \* can \* happen here . 
The US is subject to the same forces as every other nation in OUR world 's history . 
If OUR wish to avoid the fate of so many of OUR predecessors , OUR need to learn from MANY examples , both what MANY did right and what MANY did wrong . 
As crucial as FATE is to safeguard the rights of the individual , OUR need to keep an eye on the big picture , too . 
Neither can be neglected if OUR want this grand experiment OUR call the United States to succeed in the long term . 
Tell I , why do you think government assistance programs were instituted in the first place ? 
Because private charities simply were n't getting the job done . 
Government is not inherently evil , any more then any other social institution . 
JOB is simply a tool , and whether JOB does good or ill depends entirely on how JOB 's used . 
Do YOU honestly believe that poverty -LRB- as relative a term as that is -RRB- exists solely because those who are n't rich are all `` lazy worthless parasites '' ? 
You see poverty as only being a personal moral failing ? 
Then why in the world is poverty still a social issue ? 
Do you think WORLD 's fun being poor ? 
Do you think that living on government benefits gives you a luxurious lifestyle ? 
Then you need a serious reality check , I friend . 
I assure you that none of that is even remotely true . 
And generally speaking , the poor most definitely do not use benefits to buy designer clothes . 
Paying the basic bills is enough of a challenge , I promise you . 
How much is enough ? 
There is never a firm answer to that . 
ANSWER 's something that we as a community must decide through the political process , through consensus and compromise , through actually listening to each other . 
What WE need are practical , pragmatic people from all over the political spectrum to talk , to give WE PEOPLE points of view , to make suggestions , to be as forceful an advocate for PEOPLE positions as possible . 
WE need to take the best that each of WE has to offer , even the parts that you do n't agree with . 
But WE need serious ideas , not , `` EACH do n't want to pay taxes , '' not , `` But why should \* EACH \* have to so something about SPECTRUM ? ''

The revolts in the past have been against `` the power '' being used to stop individualism and freedom . 
Pretty much what liberalism is trying to do now . 
There have been NO revolts in history against a free market . 
Right now LIBERALS in Europe are revolting , striking , and looting and destroying , and even KILLING because the fiscal mess can not be supported any longer and LIBERALS are losing a tiny bit of LIBERALS FREEBIES . 
And for that LIBERALS are willing to kill .

Conservatives are trying to say and have said for years , `` Let YEARS NOT follow Europe , let Europe follow CONSERVATIVES . ''

Bankrupt countries , fiscally AND morally bankrupt under the guise of doing good and being ` compassionate . 
You ask for proof , you ask I make a good argument against liberalism , Simple , EUROPE ! 
Europe should be the little kid tagging along behind and trying to get the big kids to play with KIDS . 
Instead , if we do not change WE ways , Europe is showing WE WE own bleak future . 
ENABLING people to BE poor is what liberalism does . 
EUROPE does nothing to ennoble people EUROPE only enables PEOPLE .

That is the exact opposite of the truth . 
MAKE LIBERALS earn everything , and LIBERALS will find ambition , pride , self esteem , and drive . 
And personal responsibility . 
If we can afford to give to the poor , WE can afford to make work for POOR to do instead . 
And your claim that charity was not doing the job is completely fallacious . 
No giveaway programs were started to make up a charitable shortfall . 
ALL giveaway programs have one purpose and one purpose only . 
And that is not to help the poor , PURPOSE is to help the politician buy votes .

Welfare has already been proven to work . 
Hence why WELFARE 's been around for 80 years . 
Hence why every economic school teaches that an extension of welfare benefits is an economic stimulus . 
Back before republicans went crazy stupid REPUBLICANS knew this fact as well . 
Extention of welfare in bad times used to be a bipartisan thing because everyone who knew anything about economics knows welfare benefits the economy like every school child knows the earth rotates around the sun . 
Just because you do n't understand how EXTENTION works does n't mean EXTENTION does n't work . 
We are n't running out of money because welfare costs too much . 
WE 're running out of money because WE taxes have been way too low for about 30 years now . 
Since Reagan cut them . 
Conservatives would rather see more in CONSERVATIVES paycheck then see a country where people do not starve to death or die of a curable disease simply because PEOPLE could n't afford food and medicine .

If your health insurance wo n't cover INSURANCE , and you do n't have the money , many , many diseases will not get treated , and you get to die .

You and the liberal idiots will say that 's because IDIOTS had no insurance , that 's why IDIOTS did not get check up 's . 
Here is a simple fact , not an opinion , that even liberals should be capable of understanding . 
FACT costs MORE to have insurance to pay for check ups than FACT would to pay for check ups on our own . 
Insurance IS a for profit business . 
IF A did not charge more in premiums than A pay out , A would not be able to pay for anyone 's care for anything . 
And the insurance companies profits are regulated by politicians .

Sorry you are unwilling or unable to find the truth . 
The woman with cancer , 1 . 
That is one side of the story . 
And 2 . 
No matter , the policy had to be within 2 years of issue or the insurer was stuck with POLICY . 
HIPAAHIPAA is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 . 
PORTABILITY limits insurers power to deny or delay claims , reduces your chances of losing existing coverage , makes PORTABILITY easier and less risky to switch health plans , and prohibits insurance discrimination based on health problems . 
Key HIPAA Protections \* Non-Discrimination In a group plan , the insurer may not apply different eligibility rules , offer different benefits , or charge a higher premium to any individual on the basis of certain health factors health status , claims experience , medical history or genetic information . 
\* Guaranteed Issue Insurers providing small group coverage must offer coverage to any small employer that applies , regardless of health status or prior claims experience of the employees . 
\* Guaranteed Renewability Insurers may not cancel a health plan unless the beneficiary fails to pay the premiums or the insurer stops doing business in the market . 
\* Limits on Preexisting Condition Exclusions Insurers may not exclude -LRB- refuse to cover -RRB- treatments and services related to medical conditions that existed before the beneficiary purchased the health plan for a period ofmore than 12 months . 
If the person has had continuous coverage prior to purchasing the new plan there can be no coverage exclusions . 
State Consumer ProtectionsStates provide a variety of important protections through state law . 
These may include : the appeal of coverage decisions within the insurance company ; the appeal of coverage decisions to an impartial external reviewer ; prompt payment of claims ; access to certain specialists and health care providers ; coverage of specific treatments and services ; and many more . 
Every state has an insurance department that is ready to help you with any question or complaint you may have about your coverage . 
To find out more , contact your state insurance department .

No one ever said ONE would . 
Have you not been paying attention at all ? 
As MY said , the health care law was aimed primarily at expanding coverage and reforming insurance regulation . 
LAW has several measures aimed at improving efficiency in the health care system and works to shift the focus of treatment away from expensive specialists and toward preventive care and general practitioners , all of which should help contain costs in the long run . 
But cost containment is not and was never said to be the main intent . 
There are also several pilot programs in the law to explore ways to contain costs , but there are no easy answers . 
Besides , with a growing population , and rising costs far in excess of inflation , POPULATION would be virtually impossible to actually reduce the total costs .

An opinion strongly supported by evidence and shared by most economists . 
And your opinion that OPINION has n't helped still has absolutely no support of any kind whatsoever . 
Bush took us from a surplus to a recurring , structural deficit during a time of prosperity mainly for the sake of giving the wealthiest Americans large tax breaks . 
Obama came into office in the middle of the worst recession since the Great Depression , and ran up a deficit with one time stimulus measures to prevent the economy from collapsing completely . 
Plus , a large portion of the current deficit is simply due to lower tax revenues because of the bad economy . 
Once the economy recovers and the stimulus money is spent , Obama 's contribution to the deficit will almost completely disappear . 
Deficit spending during a national emergency -LRB- such as a severe recession -RRB- is a good thing , a necessary thing . 
THING 's like using your credit card to get through a temporary rough financial patch .

Since you seemed to have completely missed the extensive discussion on the subject , CRUMBLING will repeat CRUMBLING main post on the subject : In March 2009 , only a month after the stimulus passed , the National Association of Business Economists conducted an industry survey in which 10.3 % of economists forecast a strong impact on the economy , 60.3 % a modest impact , and 29.4 % little to no impact . 
http:\/\/www.nabe.com\/graphweek\/2009\/gw090329.htmlAround a year after the stimulus was passed , studies done by IHS Global Insight , Macroeconomic Advisers and Moody s Economy.com all estimated that the stimulus created 1.6 million to 1.8 million jobs to date and that STIMULUS ultimate impact will be roughly 2.5 million jobs . 
http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/02\/17\/bu...leonhardt.htmlThe Congressional Budget Office estimated that the effects of the stimulus in the last quarter of 2009 were 2.1 million jobs created , GDP boosted by 3.5 % , and unemployment improved by 2.1 % ECONOMISTS estimate for the first quarter of 2010 is 2.8 million jobs and 4.2 % GDP . 
Unfortunately CRUMBLING had to rely on Wikipedia for these numbers http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stimulu..._under_the_Act because the PDF 's on the CBO 's website are n't working for CRUMBLING . 
http:\/\/www.cbo.gov\/Even Ben Stein , as conservative an economist as you could wish for and certainly no fan of the Obama administration , implies in an article discussing the failure of Lehman Brothers that the stimulus and bailouts were both necessary and at least somewhat effective . 
`` But the losses to the economy following the failure of Lehman have been on the order of hundreds of billions , maybe trillions . 
Certainly the rescue and stimulus packages needed in the wake of the Lehman failure have amounted to the trillions . '' 
While CRUMBLING certainly ca n't speak for Mr Stein , CRUMBLING would imagine STEIN would argue that the stimulus money could have been better spent to much more effect , but that 's not the same as saying that the stimulus has had no effect at all or even made things worse . 
http:\/\/spectator.org\/archives\/2010\/0...-of-depressionIn any case , $ 288 billion of the stimulus , 37 % of the total , went to tax breaks of various kinds . 
Are HTTP:\/\/SPECTATOR.ORG\/ARCHIVES\/2010\/0...-OF-DEPRESSIONIN going to argue that tax cuts do n't stimulate the economy , onalandline ? 
Basically , ECONOMY comes down to this . 
Are THIS going to deny that we were on the brink of another great depression ? 
Are THIS going to deny that WE 've moved back from the brink since then ? 
You can argue exactly how much the stimulus helped the economy , and you can certainly make the case that the money could have been spent more effectively . 
But if you want to say that the stimulus had no effect at all , CRUMBLING 'm afraid you 're going to have to back that up with something fairly substantial . 
Maybe the economy would have stopped short of the brink on ECONOMY own , and maybe ECONOMY would n't have . 
Do you really think we should have taken that risk and done nothing ? 
and once again WE come back to the simple question , which is preferable , 10 % unemployment , or 25 % ? 
Yes , the current deficits are history-making and record-breaking . 
Because the recession is history-making and record-breaking . 
Most of the increase in the deficit under Obama has been due to the recession , either directly to the lost tax revenue caused by dropping GDP or to the various stimulus and bailout measures to combat the recession . 
You do n't worry about water conservation when your house is on fire , even if you 're in the middle of a drought . 
Obama has said that once the economy recovers OBAMA will reduce the deficit and work on balancing the budget , and considering that so far OBAMA has mostly done exactly what OBAMA 's said OBAMA 'll do , CRUMBLING 'm going to give OBAMA the time to make good on the promise . 
If OBAMA does n't , CRUMBLING promise CRUMBLING 'll be as mad at OBAMA as you are . 
Even putting the direct effects on the economy aside , the infrastructure spending in the Stimulus Bill is something we desperately need . 
The US has been neglecting US infrastructure since the 70 's , and US 's starting to catch up with WE . 
Remember the bridge collapse in Minneapolis in 2007 ? 
Remember the New Orleans levies failing during Katrina ? 
Remember the Northeast Blackout of 2003 ? 
These are tastes of things to come if we do n't start dealing with the problem . 
And if WE infrastructure disintegrates , the economy wo n't be far behind . 
For a more detailed discussion of the issue , CRUMBLING would recommend the History Channel 's excellent documentary , `` The Crumbling of America . '' 
As CRUMBLING just said in another thread : That is a sufficiently misleading statement as to qualify as a lie in CRUMBLING book . 
Unless there 's a recession , tax revenues pretty much always go up , regardless . 
But so do expenditures . 
If you set the tax rate to zero , you obviously get zero revenues . 
So the blanket statement that lowering taxes always increases revenues is patently false . 
Lowering taxes has two effects . 
TWO decreases the rate of taxes paid , which tends to decrease revenues . 
And TWO stimulates the economy , which enlarges the tax base , which tends to increase revenues . 
When tax rates are very high , the economic stimulus effect predominates . 
When taxes are very low , the decreased rates predominate . 
There 's a curve , with peak revenues somewhere in the middle . 
The question is which side of the curve we 're on right now ? 
Considering that current US tax rates are really very low , both by historical US standards and compared to other industrialized countries , and considering that Bush 's tax cuts clearly created a large deficit , CRUMBLING think the answer is fairly obvious . 
Then why has TAX been used by Presidents of both parties and all philosophies in every economic downtown since the Great Depression ? 
Keynesian economics have been debunked ? 
When ? 
How ? 
By whom ? 
Creating an ideological rationalization about why something that worked really did n't does n't change the reality of the situation . 
Speaking of ideology , it seems awfully convenient that yours seems to think that all ills can be cured with the same medicine - you not having to pay taxes . 
Where did this mad notion that the deficit is somehow equivalent to a bad economy come from , anyway ? 
That makes no sense . 
The relationship between the deficit and the economy is complex , and ca n't be whittled down to a simple one to one correspondence . 
In some circumstances a deficit can help the economy , in others hurt DEFICIT , and DEFICIT still others have no appreciable effect at all . 
On what basis do you claim that Obama has created any recurring deficit at all , or that DEFICIT will last decades ? 
Most of the increase of the deficit under Obama have been due to falling revenues caused by the recession , and stimulus measures . 
The stimulus is \* not \* a recurring expense , STIMULUS has an end date . 
Name one thing in the stimulus that does n't .

You mean two economists agree , right ?

`` TAYLOR ca n't find in TAYLOR analysis that the 2009 stimulus package had much effect at all , '' says economist John Taylor of Stanford University . 
Taylor , who served as undersecretary of the Treasury under former president George W. Bush , says the recovery that began last year stemmed from a pickup in business investment unrelated to government spending . 
TAYLOR dismissed the Zandi-Blinder conclusions as divorced from what is actually occurring in the economy and reflecting built-in assumptions about the impact of government spending . 
Not even you believe that lie . 
All who paid income taxes got a tax break . 
When the Democrats allowed Bush Tax Cuts to expire , they doubled the tax rate on the poor . 
The Bush Tax Cuts did n't becme effective until 2002 and 2004 , and golly gee , revenues rise after that on your source .

The Congress , by one vote , chose not to extend the Bush Tax Cuts that will expire on Jan 1 , 2011 . 
Thus the Democrats are responsible for the largest tax increase in our country 's history , to go along with their other records of highest deficits , highest debt , etc. There will be a 50 % tax increase for the poor because of the Democrats .

So was Bush . 
And so was Bush when the 2009 budget was enacted . 
Millions paid FICA taxes and got no tax break from the Bush administration whatsoever . 
Bush did n't cut taxes the working poor pay . 
We can only hope . 
WE need to undo the Bush administration 's policies which got WE into this mess . 
So instead of paying $ 1 they pay $ 1.50 . 
OMG . 
Sure . 
Once THEY stopped cutting taxes , revenues rose with inflation and GDP and stocks . 
Proportionally THEY never caught up , and that was the single biggest reason for the $ 5 trillion Bush ran up after inheriting a surplus budget . 
The economy was tanking at -7 % real and losing 700,000 jobs a month and the stock markets were crashing . 
Not the economy is growing , the private sector has created jobs for 9 straight months , and the stock market is up 65-70 % since March 2009 . 
We are not out of the deep hole the recession put WE in , but WE are n't getting deeper , in stark contrast to the picture in the first quarter 2009 . 
Not enough demand as people and businesses pay down debt .

That is a complete and total lie , and shows a profound lack of even the slightest understanding of economics . 
The economic collapse was the result of a housing bubble that burst .

The blame lies quite clearly with Republicans , but also with the Fed , Democrats , the Banks , and other groups as well . 
Anyone with even a passing understanding of economics realizes that the economic collapse has roots that go back to way before 2006 , and only mentally deficient partisan hacks believe the problems started in 2006 -LRB- actually 2007 -RRB- when the Democratic congress came to power .

Gallup : Next unemployment report will be worseMonday , October 18 , 2010 2:54:29 PM Unemployment , as measured by Gallup without seasonal adjustment , is at 10.0 % in mid-October essentially the same as the 10.1 % at the end of September but up sharply from 9.4 % in mid-September and 9.3 % at the end of August . 
This mid-month measurement confirms the late September surge in joblessness that should be reflected by the government s Nov. 5 unemployment report . 
Is 10 % better , or worse than 9.6 % ? 
Take your time ... A recession is two consecutive negative quarters of GDP growth , so we could have a double dip , and probably will unless Obama is stopped . 
You used that arbitrary number as if to say that if Obama had not wasted $ 1 trillion on the stimulus WE would have 25 % unemployment . 
You do n't know how bad STIMULUS would have gotten without the wasted money .

Your first and second sentence why your entire idea about the USA is incorrect . 
If we had n't been all that I highly doubt your countries would exist . 
In WW2 if the USA had not of assisted your country WW2 would of been overrun for example . 
And FWI , your statement about the USA 's ` rather immoral ' behavior is another example another hypocritical statement , because other countries immoral behavior are often exceedingly worse than the USA 's . 
All countries sometimes act in ` rather immoral ' ways because that is what must governments do to ensure the continued existence of their host countries at times . 
However compared to other countries I would rather be an POW etc in the USA compared to almost any other country . 
If the USA was truly immoral I would n't say that . 
You have insinuated as much , which is worse because you can not man up enough to put what you mean in plain words . 
Ok , to the rest of the forum I apologize for zinging this far off topic , I will not comment on this with MD again unless we start a new thread .

MAJORITY can tell you Obama seems to be swilling Jim Jones koolaid like JONES name is Otis Campbell drinking Mayberrys finest hooch if OBAMA thinks OBAMA is going to be reelected . 
We have a terrible job market and MAJORITY can tell Obama that spending trillions here and trillions there has failed . 
The smoke and mirrors of the white house imaginary jobs is a pathetic attempt to save Obamas butt . 
However read MAJORITY lips , Obama is gone in 2013 . 
And , that 's all MAJORITY have to say about that , except that MAJORITY am exceedingly happy the majority of Americans even a goodly number of the original jaded Obama lovers have seen the golden boys color fade from gold to OBAMA true color ; pewter gray . 
For a time MAJORITY thought MAJORITY fellow Americans had lost leave of their senses nearly worshiping the Harvard ` professor ' -LRB- a misnomer really -RRB- .

Technical definitions are all we have to determine what is and what is n't a recession . 
I 'd rather follow the technical definition then tell everyone a lie . 
There was no recession between 2000 and 2001 . 
Saying anything else is telling a lie . 
Just the same as saying we are in a recession now is telling a lie . 
Recession has a specific definition . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1976
OK technocrat , the economy went through a down cycle in 2000-2001 and is in a much deeper , and longer , down cycle now . 
Try discussing your exact technical definitions with the 28 million unemployed and under employed . 
See if they give a dam about your technicalities ! 
CURRENTPOSTID 1977
There are millions of unemployed in even a perfect economy . 
Plus employment is a lagging indicator . 
INDICATOR might take a year or two after the economy stabilizes for businesses to feel comfortable hiring again .

PROBLEM 's a problem with confidence .

The hallmark of this liberal administration and the Kool-Ade drinking liberal groupies , EXCUSES . 
Never before in human history have so many excuses , been made so often , by by so few . 
That has a familiar sound !!! 
CURRENTPOSTID 1979
But I thought government ca n't create jobs . 
So what do you want Obama to do exactly ? 
Oh wait . 
You 're one of those people who said we should have done absolutely nothing at all . 
I wonder what sort of excuses you would have given by now . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1980
There IS no PROOF that doing nothing would have made anything worse , just as there is no PROOF that the massive never ending flow of various Stimulus plans have accomplished anything but more debt . 
Of that and that alone , THERE IS PROOF ! 
And the Govt can create jobs . 
But they are only Govt jobs and thus are a burden on a vibrant economy rather than an impetus to the economy . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1981
You ca n't mathematically prove anything in economics . 
But there is lots of evidence that the Stimulus has had a significant impact , as logic would tell you STIMULUS would . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1982
Really ? 
Logic would tell us that ? 
Unemployment is still close to it 's peak . 
US spent $ 860 billion . 
Next to nothing has been done . 
Just wait until the effects of the wasted money . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1983
Logic would tell us if the Govt had n't pumped a few hundred billion in spending into the economy creating demand for jobs and paying for jobs for folks who would otherwise have been fired , unemployment would have gotten much higher and the recession would be worse . 
Conservatives tell US all the time that tax cuts spur economic growth , so if you believe that , logic would tell you that the hundreds of billions in tax cuts had an efffect as well and that the economy would have been worse and unemployment higher without ECONOMY . 
Finally , logic tells US from empirical data , including FDR 's new deal and WWII , that Govt spending stimulates the economy , and finally the fact that in this period the fact the economy went from tanking -7 &#37; real and losing 700,000 jobs a month to growing and the private sector adding jobs suggests the stimulus had a positive effect , as the bi-partisan and most economists agree . 
While $ 860 billion is a lot , I agree , and it is almost as much money wasted in the mistaken war in Iraq , comparatively MONEY represents just over 5 % of the economy . 
Given that both Govt spending and the deficit were cut in FY2010 , US should n't be surprised that this modest amount of stimulus , while logic and evidence suggest LOGIC helped turn the economy around and stop getting worse , was n't sufficiently large to really set AMOUNT on fire . 
Unfortunately , fiscal mismanagement by the prior three Republican administrations left the nation in such a precarious state of debt that only a limited amount of stimulus was prudent .

Common sense means to me something even an idiot would know .

CURRENTPOSTID 1989
Right now we have people in power with : No common sense , No uncommon sense , No practical sense , Just nonsense . 
PEOPLE have consistently repeated that if enough money is spent and WE wait long enough , PEOPLE unproven theorems , will eventually work . 
If the Government HAD $ 4 or $ 5 trillion extra dollars laying around doing nothing , perhaps , and only perhaps , a case could be made for PEOPLE theorems . 
However when every cent the people in power are spending on Stimulus is BORROWED money with no end in sight or any method to pay END back , the theorems go out the window . 
The rescinding of the Bush tax cuts are not even an issue . 
PEOPLE WILL hurt the economy and PEOPLE WON `` T lower the debt a single penny . 
ECONOMY is all liberal window dressing and sleight of hand . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1990

That 's 2 million per job . 
2 million ! 
CURRENTPOSTID 1993
The obamalama claimed that the stimulus `` CREATED '' 50,000 NEW ` WINDFARM ' JOBS . 
The only problem is those generators were up and running BEFORE the obamalama became president . 
Another 50,000 jobs ` created ' in OBAMALAMA own mind . 
Even if the stimulus did create the 3.5 million jobs claimed , which nobody believes , including the liberal media . 
STIMULUS still comes to $ 232,571.43 , cost per job created . 
So with 14.8 million unemployed , we only need $ 3,442,057,164,000.00 more stimulus to achieve full employment . 
And WE great , great , great , great , great , great , grand kids can worry about the debt . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1995
The $ 232,000.00 is the cost of a Govt created job , not the salary .

You have been brainwashed into believing the Govt is the answer . 
The Govt is not only NOT the answer , GOVT is the problem . 
The recession is\/was wholly caused by the Govt meddling in the free market . 
Then the politicians BLAME the free market for all the problems the Govt caused . 
You liberals scream about deregulation of the free market and clamor for more regulation . 
Well we had regulation , the Govt repealed many , very good , very effective regulations , in order to further THEMSELVES politically . 
Now a new financial regulation bill has been passed in great haste and in a completely partisan manner . 
ALREADY NOW is seen as ridiculous . 
The SEC was exempted from new regs . 
You want Wall Street to toe the line and LIBERALS -LRB- liberals -RRB- exempt the SEC ? 
Even Barney Frank blanched at that . 
FRANK said that the bill was passed so quickly FRANK did n't have a copy to read . 
That is an absolute intentional LIE . 
And indicative of the problem of the Govt meddling where YOU are sadly incompetent , the free market . 
YOU personally and liberals in general keep repeating that if the Govt had not WASTED well over a TRILLION dollars we 'd be in such bad shape . 
This is OPINION , NOT FACT . 
A fact is that many recession in the past have corrected YOU without any Govt intervention . 
would this have been another one to correct OPINION ? 
We will never know that because WE HAVE HAD massive intervention by the very same people that caused the recession . 
And the SEEDS of this recession were NOT planted by Bush or Republicans . 
The clock was running long before Bush , and both parties are equally to blame . 
The Stimulus did not and HAS not worked . 
Liberals can not grasp that simple FACT but the majority of the American is fully aware that obama HAS FAILED . 
And in addition to the failure , we now have more debt accumulating than any other president in history . 
Bush increased the debt by an average of $ 625 billion per year . 
obama IS increasing the debt by $ 1.5 TRILLION per year . 
And you liberals claim Bush was terrible . 
You ARE right , Bush was terrible -LRB- and BUSH was `` the Govt . '' -RRB- 
and now obama is the Govt and BUSH is 2.4 times WORSE than Bush . 
Why does Freddie and Fannie now need ANOTHER $ 300 + BILLION to further bail LIBERALS out ? 
Because F&F invented , bought , and guaranteed the fictitious `` sub-prime '' loans . 
The free market did not invent those worthless loans , calling LIBERALS what LIBERALS are , F&F & `` THE GOVT did that for the good of all of us . 
Liberals scream about the ruthless crooks on Wall Street . 
TARP was passed in a DEMOCRAT Congress , and TARP bailed out , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , wait for CONGRESS , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , WALL STREET !! 
Would CONGRESS have been better if the Govt had stayed out of the free market ? 
YES . 
If they HAD , maybe there would NOT have even been a recession . 
You want proof that YOU 're drinking the liberal Kool-Ade and that the stimulus has failed ? 
Look to the politicians feeding YOU that Kool-Ade . 
Are POLITICIANS running for re-election on the merits of obamacare ? 
NO ! 
Are POLITICIANS running on the great jobs reports ? 
NO ! 
Are POLITICIANS running on the great Stimulus plan ? 
NO ! 
POLITICIANS campaigns are one thing and one thing only . 
F&F opponent is worse than F&F . 
NOT how much good F&F 've done , instead , F&F opponent will be even worse !

POLITICIANS 're saying , the pooch is screwed , and YOU ca n't hear POLITICIANS because YOU ears are full of the Kool-Ade . 
CURRENTPOSTID 1999
The only brain washing going on here has convinced you that the fairy tales about the free market are in fact accurate . 
Government is not the answer to many problems , you are right . 
Unfortunately for the narrative you are trying to convince us of , government at other times actually IS the answer . 
No one believes government should solve all problems , or even most problems , that is a straw man invented the the believers in the laissez faire fairy tale . 
The reality is , government did play a role in the current economic crisis , but the reality is also that the market did as well . 
Government did keep interest rates too low , but BELIEVERS also deregulated the whole industry -LRB- that means less government , not more -RRB- , and the market failed . 
Banks did act incompetently . 
BELIEVERS did , when given more freedom , cause a massive problem . 
The same is true of consumers of housing . 
People bought houses PEOPLE could n't afford , not because government made PEOPLE , but because PEOPLE made irrational decisions . 
Irrational decisions are not taken into account in the laissez faire fairy tale story . 
Nor are market failures , externalities , etc. But that is the problem some of us are able to see the problems government solves and the problems PROBLEM creates . 
US do n't need a black and white world where X is the problem and Y is the solution . 
Not when the reality is that sometimes X IS a problem , but SOLUTION is also sometimes a solution . 
Just like Y is sometimes a solution , but SOLUTION can also be a problem as well . 
That is the reality of the market -LRB- I do n't call SOLUTION the free market , as that is a mythical concept made up in the laissez faire fairy tales . 
SOLUTION is sort of like a unicorn -RRB- , SOLUTION can do some things extraordinarily well , but can not do others things as well . 
Government is the same . 
But that takes a level of nuance and recognition of complexity that too many are incapable of recognizing . 
I really do tire of the simplistic arguments where either government is the source of all problems , or greedy corporations are the source of all problems . 
The reality is CORPORATIONS are both capable of doing good things as well as bad .

-LRB- giggles -RRB- PRAGMATIST ears are full of Kool-Ade ? 
Dan , PRAGMATIST think your metaphor has kinda derailed here . 
Look , like PRAGMATIST 've said before , PRAGMATIST 'm a pragmatist - PRAGMATIST go with what works , and PRAGMATIST go where the evidence leads PRAGMATIST . 
If you want to convince PRAGMATIST of your position , then show PRAGMATIST evidence . 
Or a thorough argument . 
Or \* something \* that 's a reason to think that . 
Just saying that government is evil and always the problem over and over is n't going to cut PROBLEM , you need to show how and why government is the problem . 
No one is saying that the market is evil or needs to be done away with or the source of nothing but problems . 
Well , at least not anyone with an ounce of sense . 
The free market is an extraordinarily powerful engine for creating material wealth . 
But that 's really all ENGINE does . 
As PRAGMATIST 've previously pointed out , the market left to PREVIOUSLY own devices can create some pretty bad situations . 
PREVIOUSLY needs to be balanced with other institutions . 
That does n't necessarily need to be government , but at least so far , government has been the most effective -LRB- if very imperfect -RRB- tool for doing that . 
If you have a better suggestion , please share SUGGESTION . 
PRAGMATIST am not especially interested in laying blame for this recession . 
PRAGMATIST 'm much more interested in figuring out what to do \* now . 
\* PRAGMATIST agree completely that the seeds of this recession go way back , and many hands helped plant them . 
But that does n't help us find a way out of WAY now . 
As PRAGMATIST said before , fiscal stimulus is about the only tool available to the President and Congress to fight a recession . 
If you have a suggestion for something else to try , please share that too . 
In general , PRAGMATIST believe in balanced budgets , and do n't like deficit spending . 
But there are times when deficits are both appropriate and necessary . 
Just like you should generally keep your family budget balanced , but sometimes you need to borrow because of unusual circumstances . 
A family emergency , an accident or other unforeseen expense not covered by insurance , etc. . 
The comparison between Presidents Bush and Obama is not about how big their deficits are , but what THEIR 're being run up for . 
President Bush ran up a recurring structural deficit during a time of prosperity primarily to fund tax cuts for the top earners . 
This would be sort of like quitting your well paying full time career and instead taking a part time job , without changing your spending . 
President Obama , on the other hand , has run up a deficit with emergency , limited spending to deal with the current crisis . 
This is more analogous to if you had a fire in your house , and your insurance did n't give you enough coverage to fix everything , so you take out a loan to get things back to how EARNERS should be . 
PRAGMATIST do n't like bailouts any more then you do , but EARNERS are necessary . 
Just look at the damage letting Lehman Brothers fail caused . 
What would have happened if we 'd allowed , what was DAMAGE ? 
Something like a dozen major companies ? 
What if WE 'd let all of them fail at the same time ? 
Sometimes life does n't give you any good options , and you have to choose the least bad one . 
Surely you ran into situations like that running your business , when you had to make a hard choice between the lesser of two evils ? 
Yes , the stimulus \* has \* worked , just not enough . 
We 've been over this at length already , do PRAGMATIST need to go over the CBO reports , unemployment and GDP figures , independent economic analyzes , surveys of economists , and all of that \* again \* ? 
This will be , what , the fourth time now ? 
Something like that . 
You had no answer to all that evidence before , do you have one now ? 
As for the way Democrats are running their campaigns this year , PRAGMATIST have to admit PRAGMATIST am completely mystified . 
But then political campaigns are often not governed by reason and facts ... 
CURRENTPOSTID 2004
I 'm not much for laying blame either . 
But in this case , the blame is on `` THE GOVT , '' the same people you hope will fix WHAT THEY BROKE ! 
Not Democrats , Not Republicans , not liberals , not conservatives -------- POLITICIANS of both parties caused our recession , unknowingly , and have no knowledge of how to fix -------- . 
Over and over , and over again , MY post like liberal OPINIONS ARE FACTS , OVER are not facts same as my posting are n't facts unless I can point to a proof . 
You say Stimulus HAS worked , just not enough . 
That is FAILURE . 
That is the rewarding of the mediocre as liberals are wont to do . 
TRYING is just trying . 
DOING is accomplishment . 
What happens if this company fails or that company fails ? 
SOMETHING ELSE TAKES THEIR PLACE . 
That is the free market . 
obamalama said GM must not fail , Many of your ` esteemed ' economists said GM must not fail . 
GM did fail and is still an unconstitutional Government manufacturing company . 
In the process of becoming a Govt manufacturing co. , `` THE GOVT , '' violated long existing bankruptcy laws as MANY were inconvenient to the Govt . 
Bond holders got screwed , the taxpayer got screwed , and GM was GIFTED to the UAW in exchange for votes . 
And `` THE GOVT '' that you place SO much faith in , sweetened the pot for the UAW and GIFTED $ 60 BILLION in cash in addition to the bailout billions . 
Then this same wonderful GOVT claims that GM paid back all of the bailout . 
Yes BILLIONS did , BILLIONS paid GOVT back with part of the $ 60 billion in WORTHLESS STOCK `` THE GOVT '' purchased for GM . 
Stock presently worth $ 00.75 , IF STOCK were traded . 
AND THAT IS A FACT !! 
AND `` THE GOVT , '' GAVE Chrysler to FIAT . 
Someday we will learn why , other than somehow helping the UAW more . 
How much do you REFUSE to see ? 
There is much , much more .

CURRENTPOSTID 2012
Dan , breaking the economy and fixing ECONOMY are two different things . 
While what was done wrong to get us here is important to learn from in making decisions in the future , giving the economy a boost now \* is \* something US know how to do . 
Fiscal stimulus has been being used successfully by administrations of both parties since the Great Depression . 
And as I 've already shown , there is ample evidence that the stimulus \* has \* helped the economy . 
You insist on clinging to the sliver of uncertainty inherent in everything in life just because you do n't like where the evidence leads . 
That 's your privilege , of course , but you ca n't expect anyone else to pay attention to you if that 's what you choose to do . 
If you hit a nail with a hammer , and the nail is only driven partway in , do you declare the hammer a failure and toss HAMMER away , or do you hit the nail again ? 
If \* one \* company is going under , then sure , let the market do MARKET thing , even if MARKET 's a really big one . 
But if there are a lot of large companies all going under at the same time ? 
As a thought experiment , consider the extreme case - if every company in the country failed at the same time . 
DISASTER would be a total disaster , right ? 
Each company that fails represents a hit to the economy . 
Individually , each failure is small enough that the economy as a whole can handle ECONOMY . 
But if you get too much at one time , especially if the economy is already weak , TIME can cause a real problem . 
The economy is resilient and can take a lot of punishment , but there is a limit . 
CURRENTPOSTID 2014
You present the `` Doomsday Scenario , '' and of course , the result would be Doomsday , SURPRISE .

How many would have failed ?

FIRMS only meant it as a thought experiment to point out that if a lot of large companies all fail at once , that would have larger implications beyond just those companies . 
Obviously FIRMS 'm not suggesting that there 's any possibility that every company in the country could actually fail at the same time , that 's a rather silly scenario if taken literally . 
No , nobody knows how many would have failed if the government had done nothing . 
But we do know that Lehman Brothers \* did \* fail , and THAT had major repercussions for the entire economy , and helped push WE into recession . 
And WE do know that quite a few large financial firms were also in trouble at the same time . 
Would SCENARIO really have been worth the risk to do nothing ? 
And FIRMS 'm no happier about the behavior of a lot of those firms after THOSE got the bailout money then you are , but what can WE do ? 
Should Congress try to pass a law to make THOSE do the right thing ? 
Of course not , talk about government intruding on the market , and COURSE probably would n't work anyway . 
So the choice WE have is , do WE hold WE noses and help a bunch of undeserving schmucks solely because THOSE 've managed to worm THOSE way into important positions , or do WE let THOSE go down and take the risk THOSE 'll take the rest of down with THOSE ? 
Besides , a lot of the TARP money has been paid back , and FIRMS believe the program is actually expected to turn a nice profit for the taxpayer when all is said and done . 
As for the stimulus ... If each time you hit the nail TIME 's driven in just a tiny bit , even if AMOUNT 's a microscopic amount , after a trillion hits you 'll have moved the nail appreciably , even if TIME 's not been driven all the way home yet . 
Besides , what else are you going to do if you toss the hammer aside ? 
Try to drive in the nail with your mind ? 
-LRB- j\/k -RRB- We 've gone from a major recession with a shrinking economy shedding jobs at a breathtaking rate to a stagnant economy with stable yet unacceptably high unemployment . 
That \* is \* progress , even if WE still have a long way to go yet . 
And there is plenty of evidence , as FIRMS 've shown , that the stimulus helped . 
When PLENTY comes to the campaign ... -LRB- shrugs -RRB- What can FIRMS say ? 
Democrats are a bunch of wimps ? 
FIRMS really do n't know what 's going on with them . 
FIRMS 've heard some talking heads on TV speculate that the people running the campaigns think that , `` FIRMS may be bad , but FIRMS would have been a lot worse if FIRMS 'd done nothing , '' is too complicated an argument to get across in a campaign . 
FIRMS 've no idea if PEOPLE had any idea what PEOPLE were talking about or not . 
It seems like the Democrats lost the spin war and just kinda gave up . 
Do n't ask FIRMS why . 
WAR seems to FIRMS -LRB- yes , this is purely FIRMS impression -RRB- that people are upset about the economy and scared for PEOPLE future . 
Which is , of course , completely understandable and justified . 
But a lot of times people who are scared and upset react more emotionally , maybe the Dems are afraid that people are too emotional right now to listen to facts and figures ? 
FIRMS really do n't know , FIRMS 'm purely speculating here .

Wait a minute Dan , that almost sounds like you 're complaining about the government \* not \* spending money . 
LOL Is n't LOL a good thing if THING took less money to deal with the problem then was originally thought ? 
I do n't know for sure how much , if any , of the bailout money has been paid back , and I do n't really want to argue about MUCH . 
-LRB- To be honest , I just do n't feel like doing the work to come up with hard numbers . -RRB- 
That 's not really the point . 
TARP was designed to keep the financial system from completely collapsing , which SYSTEM did . 
Do you think liberals \* wanted \* to bail out Wall Street ? 
We had to do STREET because the danger of severe damage to the economy was too great .

To push the politicians to the side and LET the FREE MARKET WORK , could have been the much wiser thing to do . 
But while there is no proof of that , neither is there any proof that letting the people that caused the problems continue to manipulate the free market to POLITICIANS own ends was wise either . 
WE ARE where WE are now . 
And the people in power now have had and do have but one single plan . 
BORROW MORE , SPEND MORE BORROWED MONEY ! 
Sorry that you are unable to realize that the majority of Americans do not agree with that `` plan . 
`` This from a liberal site :10 \/ 04\/2010The federal government &#8217; s unpopular &#8211; and often vilified &#8212; $ 700 billion bailout program officially came to an end when the clock struck midnight early Monday morning . 
The Troubled Asset Relief Program &#8217; s -LRB- TARP -RRB- formal sunset date means that no new programs will be funded under the initiative and no more money will be doled out to prop up ailing banks , although existing programs &#8211; such as the government &#8217; s foreclosure prevention efforts &#8211; will continue to run S course with the money that &#8217; s already been allotted . 
Capitalists , tax-paying Americans , and even lawmakers who voted for the bill that made TARP possible two yearsago to the day have criticized the government &#8217; s massive intervention in the financial system . 
Initially , this monumental rescue effort was expected to cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars &#8211; a figure that prompted outcries and protests across the nation . 
But with banks now turning a profit and repaying TAXPAYERS TARP dollars , and even the automakers and insurance giant AIG expected to be able to pay back at least part of TAXPAYERS capital injections , the program &#8217; s price tag has shrunk to a fraction of that . 
The latest reports on the Treasury &#8217; s estimates put the total cost of TARP at less than $ 50 billion . 
Some officials have even gone so far as to say OFFICIALS expect the government &#8217; s bailout efforts to actually turn a profit for taxpayers when all is said and done . 
Numbers released by the Congressional Budget Office -LRB- CBO -RRB- in August are not too far off from the Treasury &#8217; s figures . 
CBO &#8217; s assessment is that TARP will carry an expense of $ 66 billion . 
Treasury says $ 50 billion , CBO says $ 66 billion , liberal writer says , `` not too far off . ''

-LRB- quote = Dan40 ; 3076858 -RRB- More of the ` standard ' liberal game plan , `` Always attempt to twist any conservatives words to mean what you know 100 % they did not mean . '' 
-LRB- quote -RRB- Take DAN40 easy , Dan , that was meant as a purely humorous remark . 
You 'll note the LOL on the end ? 
And once again , unrelentingly , you try to avoid reality by calling ONCE an opinion and pretending that makes ONCE equally valid to claim that the stimulus hurt the economy . 
That makes as much sense as saying that the idea of a round Earth is an opinion -LRB- which ONCE is -RRB- and therefore it is equally valid to say that the Earth is flat . 
Why are you so determined to cling to an idea that both all the evidence and your own theory says is wrong ? 
37 % of the stimulus was tax breaks , and YOU have yet to hear \* anyone \* claim that tax cuts do n't stimulate the economy . 
YOU 've repeatedly challenged you to come up with a single shred of evidence that says the stimulus did n't help the economy and you 've repeatedly utterly and completely failed . 
In any case , are you seriously suggesting that if the financial sector had completely collapsed that things would n't have been much , much worse ? 
As in Great Depression levels of worse ? 
Is that 100 % absolutely certain ? 
Of course not , nothing in life is . 
COURSE 's not 100 % absolutely certain the sun will rise in the East tomorrow morning . 
Yes , politicians are human and fallible , and yes ONES do n't entirely know what ONES 're doing . 
Just like everyone else in the world . 
Here 's a news flash for EVERYONE , Dan , the free market is made up of humans who are just as fallible and just as often do n't know what ONES 're doing . 
Nobody forced the banks to make all those subprime mortgages , nobody forced the banks to encourage people to borrow more then PEOPLE could afford , and no one forced PEOPLE to bundle those bad debts as derivatives that have lead to so much grief . 
The politicians bear a lot of blame for getting us where US are . 
So does the market . 
Your argument about `` Why should YOUR trust politicians to get YOUR out of this mess when ONES 're the ones who got YOUR in MESS , '' can just as easily be applied to the market . 
There is no one single villain in this story , and there 's no single quick fix , either . 
And as for the $ 16,000,000,000.00 , you seem to have no sense of scale when SENSE comes to money . 
that sum can just as easily be expressed as 0.016 petadollars or as 1,600,000,000,000,000 millicents . 
So what ? 
Changing units and moving a decimal point to make something look bigger or smaller is a silly tactic . 
The difference between 50 and 66 is not huge , especially when you 're talking about estimates of something there is a \* lot \* of uncertainty about . 
Even if DIFFERENCE is in billions of dollars .

CURRENTPOSTID 2031
The fact that the statement was about as divorced from reality as STATEMENT could get . 
Of course , you live in opposite world , so we do n't expect you to understand . 
Banks were indeed pressured into giving low income -LRB- read sub-prime -RRB- loans . 
People were widely encouraged to enter into home ownership , despite the fact that PEOPLE could not afford OWNERSHIP , and it was the GSEs , through government pressure , that started the entire practice of sub-prime bundling . 
So yeah ... What SUB-PRIME said was true , if by `` true '' you mean `` completely false '' . 
CURRENTPOSTID 2032
Almost everything THEY say here is an easily disproven lie . 
Pressured ? 
No they were n't . 
The government was involved in the subprime industry , but 85 % of all subprime mortgages were issues by private industries . 
http:\/\/www.mcclatchydc.com\/2008\/10\/1...ixzz12xTyWY91AI suggest you read this as well . 
http:\/\/knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu\/a...articleid=1812The reality is , the largest role government played in the creation and collapse of the housing bubble , was keeping interests far too low for far too long . 
Not Fannie and Freddy , nor government forcing banks to give loans -LRB- REALITY did n't happen -RRB- , etc. Securitization of debt was also not something forced on the banks by government . 
GOVERNMENT has a long history , and I can not imagine where you came up with the idea that IDEA was forced onto anyone by banks -LRB- for future reference , FUTURE is best to provide links to support such absurd claims -RRB- . 
Read up a bit on GOVERNMENT 's history . 
http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/SecuritizationSubprime bundling is 100 % a phenomenon of private institutions . 
You really need to either educate yourself and read up on these issues , or stop reading dishonest sources that lie and distort the facts . 
The reality is government certainly had a role to play in causing this crisis , but they were not the only catalyst , nor the main catalyst . 
There is plenty of blame to share between government , banks , and people who took out debt THEY could n't possible service . 
Your schewed dishonest partisan view of the issue , means it is best not to make declarative statements , because when VIEW comes to this issue , you do n't know what you are talking about . 
CURRENTPOSTID 2033
The government was the initial mover of sub-prime loans . 
ONES were the ones that initially pushed banks into issuing loans , and , because those loans were so risky , ONES pushed the GSEs into bundling ONES to mitigate the risk . 
No one in the private sector wanted to touch that market , originally . 
It was the GSEs , with ONES wink and a nod hint that these bundles would be insured by the government against loss , that spurred the initial private investor involvement . 
The only truth at all to your words is that the private sector and Wall Street investors were deeply involved by the time SECTOR all crashed . 
TRUTH had taken a life of TRUTH 's own in the private markets , leaving the GSEs with less than half of all bundling . 
But INVOLVEMENT was government involvement in the markets that got the ball rolling , in the first place . 
CURRENTPOSTID 2035
Sometimes Dan seems to have a bit of a tendency to sound like government is always the cause of all problems , and letting the free market operate unfettered is the solution to everything . 
My point was simply that the mess we find WE in was not caused simply by Washington ordering banks and other institutions to make unwise financial decisions . 
Bad policy decisions in the government certainly played a role , but decisions made in the private sector were a big big factor in causing the recession . 
Just pointing out there 's plenty of blame to go around . 
Like Alan Greenspan said about the behavior of mortgage lenders , Those of WE who have looked to the self-interest of lending institutions to protect shareholders equity , MY included , are in a state of shocked disbelief .

Still using the NY Times liberal propaganda machine as a source ? 
NYT long ago stopped paying any attention to TRUTH . 
Use better , less biased sources . 
You do not see me using Fox News as a source for the same reason . 
Is the Govt strictly to blame ? 
VERY NEARLY . 
Yes the private sector did jump in and take FULL advantage of the license to steal that the Govt gave them . 
Should that come as a surprise ? 
Had the Govt NOT created the atmosphere and opportunity for near illegal business practices , the private sector would not have BEEN ABLE to take advantage of a situation that did not exist . 
Being the old fart that ME am , ME remember the days when bankers were the most cautious business people around . 
The old joke was that to get a loan , you had to prove to the banker that you absolutely did not need the money ! 
If you did not have 20 % down and excellent credit and a good and permanent job , RENT . 
Because you would not get a loan . 
Bankers had no intention of changing PEOPLE attitudes and practices , the Govt insisted that ALL had a right to own a house whether PEOPLE could afford HOUSE or not . 
As totally stupid as that sounds , our elected representatives actually said such things . 
And REQUIRED that bankers act toward that end . 
Do you leave your car running with the doors and windows open and the keys in CAR , parked on a downtown street while you go shopping ? 
NO , you do n't . 
But that is what the Govt did with the mortgage and financial industries . 
Yes the private sector still had to be dishonest and drive away in the car , so they are not blameless . 
ME know ME to be absolutely honest , but ME 've never been tempted with BILLIONS with no fear of prosecution . 
CURRENTPOSTID 2039
Well , that would be one of my problems with Greenspan . 
Because once the government implied that THAT would back those bundles against loss , even though it was n't supposed to be true , ONCE opened the door to full fledged involvement of the markets . 
Of course , ONCE was reckless , but THAT were doing what the government wanted THAT to do . 
A lot of people saw the problem develop and tried to put a stop to STOP . 
Sad that Greenspan was astonished by LOT all . 
That self-interest of the lending institutions had the government interest of pushing the sub-prime loans super-imposed on top of SELF-INTEREST . 
What really galls me is to see Obama , of all people , wag OBAMA finger at the banks , as if OBAMA had no personal involvement in the entire mess . 
And now , we 're supposed to forget what started NOW all , and accept Obama 's tired analogy of Republicans driving the car into the ditch . 
NOW 's quite ridiculous . 
CURRENTPOSTID 2040
Your logic is completely flawed . 
If not for government , the environment to do these sorts of things would have happened naturally . 
With no restrictions in place , THINKERS would have done the same thing . 
Without restriction , a license to steal exists naturally , only curbed by others ability to use force to protect THINKERS assets . 
Government NEVER required banks to do what THINKERS did . 
THINKERS did NEVER because THINKERS were short term thinkers who ignored the long term consequences of THINKERS actions , in order to gain the short term benefits . 
That has nothing to do with government , and everything to do with the modern business environment . 
The assumption that underlies most right wing economic thought is that we assume rational actors . 
The reality is , that assumption can not accurately be made . 
People 's actions are far too often irrational to make that assumption . 
The irrationality of the actions of bankers and people taking loans , combined with the artificially low interest rates -LRB- an idea advanced by Friedman -RRB- , created this mess . 
So government had a role to play , but to say that very nearly all blame lies with government is beyond absurd . 
CURRENTPOSTID 2041
Oh , for crying out loud , Dan , DAN was only citing the NY Times to source the Greenspan quote , and DAN only used that because it was the first source Google found for DAN . 
Since there 's no real dispute about what GREENSPAN said , DAN did n't feel the need to wade through the minutes of the Congressional hearing GREENSPAN said CONGRESSIONAL at . 
: PAnd do n't GREENSPAN see the irony of accusing the government of encouraging `` near illegal business practices '' considering that DISPUTE 's only the government 's actions that make illegal practices illegal in the first place ? 
Errr , what personal involvement ? 
Obama was strictly a private citizen before Jan 2005 , and not involved in the financial sector at all . 
And while DAN 'm certainly not an expert , DAN do n't recall any important financial legislation going through the Senate between then and Jan 2009 . 
Unless someone can correct DAN on that ? 
CURRENTPOSTID 2042
I certainly can . 
Although many other Senators and Representatives had a much deeper involvement with blocking meaningful reform at the GSEs , Obama himself was one of the top five recipients of funds from the GSEs during OBAMA term as Senator . 
During that time , Senate Bill 190 was released from committee favorably to the floor , but was never brought to debate because the Democrats made BILL very clear that SENATORS were in lockstep opposition to OPPOSITION , and Republicans did not have enough votes to push for TIME on SENATORS own . 
Obama was one of those Senators . 
http:\/\/www.govtrack.us\/users\/questio...=bill:s109-190This is the bill that McCain unsuccessfully sought to revive during the election , and Obama refused to do so , even though , by then , the problem was VERY apparent to anyone that was paying attention to PROBLEM , and had grown far worse even just since the bill was first released from committee . 
Now , that does nothing to say that Obama was anywhere near as involved as certain others , especially Dodd , who had so much involvement with the housing crash that OBAMA literally retired at the end of OBAMA term . 
But Mr. Obama 's current rhetoric on the causes of our economic situation simply flies in the face of reality , and OBAMA is far more culpable for the situation than OBAMA would like anyone to believe .

You might want to extensively research this : From the Orlando paper : `` Gore was right that foundations will play a key role in keeping the climate scam alive as evidence of outright climate fraud grows , just as YOU were critical in the beginning when the Joyce Foundation in 2000 and 2001 provided the seed money to start the Chicago Climate Exchange . 
THIS started trading in 2003 , and what THIS trades is , essentially , air . 
More specifically perhaps , hot air . 
The Chicago Climate Exchange -LRB- CCX -RRB- advertises EXCHANGE as `` North America 's only cap-and-trade system for all six greenhouse gases , with global affiliates and projects worldwide . '' 
Barack Obama served on the board of the Joyce Foundation from 1994 to 2002 when the CCX startup grants were issued . 
As president , pushing cap-and-trade is one of his highest priorities . 
Now is n't that special ? 
`` The CCX is supposed to become worth $ 10 TRILLION if Cap 'n' Trade is passed . 
OBAMA 'd say that is very close to the private citizen BHO , being involved in international financial matters .

Errr , that 's a teeny bit off topic , Dan - we were talking about the economy , the financial industry , and the stimulus , not climate change or cap and trade . 
But since you brought ERRR up ... `` Climate scam '' ? 
`` Climate fraud '' ? 
And you accuse liberals of drinking kool-aid ? 
Come on Dan , the debate over the reality of climate change is over . 
DEBATE ended 29 August 2005 . 
The evidence that DEBATE is happening is absolutely overwhelming at this point , and trying to pretend there 's a scientific debate about EVIDENCE is about on a level with the big tobacco execs going before Congress back in the 80 's and saying that EXECS did n't believe that EXECS product is addictive or causes disease . 
If you 're thinking of the so called climategate email - the one that said something about finding a trick to hide the decline - I 'm afraid you 've been bamboozeled . 
That was one email out of more then a thousand , taken completely out of context and given a heaping helping of innuendo . 
Using those methods , you could make almost anyone look like an ax murderer . 
The trick was as in , `` Hey , YOU just learned a great new trick for solving differential equations , '' and the general context was a discussion of finding a way to integrate very different kinds of data into a coherent whole . 
Which usually ai n't easy , let I tell you . 
The people involved in that email have had PEOPLE work gone over with a fine toothed comb , and absolutely no wrong doing or data manipulation has been found . 
The worst PEOPLE were guilty of was griping about having to hand PEOPLE raw data over to someone PEOPLE felt would misuse WORST . 
And even if you chose not to believe that , you could throw out the entire life 's work of those guys and there would still be a mountain of evidence saying that climate change is real and CHANGE is happening . 
In some cases literal mountains - alpine glaciers have been retreating dramatically around the world for decades . 
You have the historical climate records of the last century or two , ice cores from Greenland , Antarctica , and alpine glaciers from around the world , tree ring data from around the world , lake and ocean sediment evidence from around the world - all of which point to the exact same thing : CO2 levels in the atmosphere have spiked and temperatures are rising dramatically . 
The debate now is about how bad the effects are really going to be , and how much we can and should do about DEBATE . 
And even if you still insist on denying climate change , how can you seriously argue that getting off of fossil fuels , particularly oil , is an important and urgent priority ? 
Being depending on oil imports form the Middle East has big and obvious political and economic effects . 
And WE 've hit peak oil - even with improving technology the total amount of oil produced is going to start an inexorable decline from now on . 
That plus the surging demand for oil from rapidly developing parts of the world like India and China ... supply and demand , anyone ? 
And before you start saying that the market will take care of MARKET ... WE 've known since the 70 's that WE need to get off of oil , and what has the private sector done about MARKET ? 
Not a thing . 
WE 've been sitting on WE thumbs for decades . 
The Brazilians , for example , have not . 
They decided after the oil shocks of the 70 's that THEY were going to be energy independent , and guess what ? 
THEY are . 
Thanks to determined action , the Brazilian economy mostly runs on home grown sugar cane ethanol - THEY import virtually no oil at all . 
Oil prices are going to start going up inexorably from now on , that 's just a fact of life . 
If that rise is gradual , sure , then the market will be able to deal with RISE . 
But what if RISE 's not gradual ? 
We saw just a few years ago that prices can spike dramatically in a very short amount of time , even without things like terrorism or international politics getting involved . 
What if oil prices double in a month - for several months in a row ? 
Is that a risk worth taking ?

Once again you do ONCE . 
There are 2 paragraphs highlighted . 
You pick the first onlt and then drone on and on with opinion stated as fact . 
Your unceasing habit . 
You believe Climate Change to be a reality , but no such FACTUAL reality has been proven . 
I 'm not saying CHANGE is not real , I 'm very doubtful as climate does fluctuate , but I do n't know either way . 
But you ignored the second and more important paragraph . 
If BHO IS deeply involved in the CCX , then BHO serves only BHO bank account when talking about energy bills , not the USA . 
CURRENTPOSTID 2054
And once again you do ONCE , trying to ignore inconvenient facts by labeling them as opinions . 
ONCE is a fact that the evidence for anthropogenic climate change is overwhelming , not an opinion , and even cursory research would tell you that . 
And you completely ignore the fact that the real concrete goal of cap and trade is to get us off of fossil fuels . 
But , since you want me to directly address President Obama 's personal involvement in CCX , let 's review : Noungrant -LRB- plural grants -RRB- 1 . 
The act of granting ; a bestowing or conferring ; concession ; allowance ; permission .2 . 
The yielding or admission of something in dispute .3 . 
The thing or property granted ; a gift ; a boon .4 . 
A transfer of property by deed or writing ; especially , au appropriation or conveyance made by the government ; as , a grant of land or of money ; also , the deed or writing by which the transfer is made . 
Nounfoundation -LRB- plural foundations -RRB- 4 . 
A donation or legacy appropriated to support a charitable institution , and constituting a permanent fund ; endowment .5 . 
That which is founded , or established by endowment ; an endowed institution or charity . 
You will note the distinct lack of words like `` loan '' `` investment '' or `` repayment '' in these definitions . 
How then does the Joyce Foundation have any financial interest in the worth of CCX ? 
And even if they did , how would that financially benefit President Obama ? 
Being a former board member does not give MEMBER a financial stake in FOUNDATION . 
And even if MEMBER did have some sort of investment in STAKE , which ME do n't think is even possible with a charitable foundation , Obama 's assets have been put in a blind trust , like all Presidents . 
So , Dan , ME 'm afraid your logic fails not once , not twice , but three times . 
CURRENTPOSTID 2055

CCX is not a charitable foundation .

Climate change !!!!!!!!!!! 
Now I 'm more than a bit older than you , but still I 've been around for well less than a century . 
A mere 70 years . 
In that time I 've lived thru : A cold period in a general warming trend . 
A warming period in a general cooling trend . 
A very warm period of a general warming trend . 
A very cold period of a general cooling trend . 
Stable periods in a generally unstable climate . 
Unstable periods in a generally stable climate . 
ALL of the above have been `` official '' decrees by learned people that study such climatic events . 
All of the above are not possible in one short lifetime , yet PEOPLE all have been official proclamations . 
Now we are told that WE have warmed up a small part of A DEGREE since 1900 . 
Less than one half of one degree warmer now than HALF was 110 years ago . 
In order for that to be true , WE must assume that temperature recordings in 1900 were accurate to within less than one half of one degree . 
So do you BELIEVE that temp recordings 110 years ago were accurate to within 100 % to 99.75 % I have very serious doubts that they were . 
CURRENTPOSTID 2071
Well , in order to decide what to make of something like changing pronouncements on where the climate is going , CLIMATE helps to understand a bit about the nature of science . 
Science is never absolutely certain , and is never finished . 
The basic premise of science is to admit that neither a researcher or their instruments can ever be perfect - you do the best you can , make an estimate of how close you figure you probably got to the truth , and then leave the best record you can as a guide to the next person to come along and tackle the problem . 
That 's true of even the most well established and respected theories in science . 
Take the theory of gravity - PREMISE does n't get much more certain then gravity , does THEORY ? 
And yet just a few years ago NASA sent up a satellite called Gravity Probe B to try and poke holes in B . 
As far as scientists are concerned , YEARS 's a win win - if SCIENTISTS can find holes , then SCIENTISTS can address SCIENTISTS and make the theory better , and if SCIENTISTS ca n't , YEARS increases the confidence SCIENTISTS have in the theory . 
So I 'm not really sure what `` official pronouncements '' you may have heard , but I can guarantee that no peer reviewed article would have made such a claim with absolute certainty . 
In fact , I figure NO 's more then likely that what you heard was n't coming from scientists at all ; it was probably the news media taking some tentative research and blowing RESEARCH up to make a good headline . 
You know how people complain that one day scientists say that food X will make you live a hundred years , and the next day PEOPLE 're saying ONE 'll kill you ? 
That 's not science doing that , that 's the media . 
A scientist will say , `` Well , after following so many people for so many years who were eating so much of food X , YOU saw the following outcomes . '' 
Science is in the business of dealing with very complex and hard to understand things , BUSINESS 's in the business of nuance . 
As I think PEOPLE all know , the news media does n't much care for complexity or nuance . 
So , does all this apply to climate change ? 
Yes . 
Are scientists absolutely certain that human caused climate change is happening ? 
No. . 
Could NO. turn out later that this was all a big mistake , a misinterpretation of faulty data or something ? 
Absolutely . 
Then why should we listen to warnings of climate change ? 
Because life never gives WE certainties , and all WE can do is make the best decisions WE can with what WE have . 
Generally speaking , science gets better as time goes on . 
What a scientist says today is going to be more reliable then what they were saying yesterday . 
Global warming has been a major topic of research for a good thirty years now , and as time goes on , the evidence that TIME is happening has mounted , and the uncertainties shrunken , until today there is consensus in the scientific community that the evidence overwhelmingly says EVIDENCE is happening . 
TOPIC 's about as certain as science ever gets about anything . 
In fact , the uncertainty is now so low that the American Association for the Advancement of Science -LRB- AAAS -RRB- and the National Academy of Sciences -LRB- NAS -RRB- have issued quite literally unprecedented statements about climate change . 
They 're saying that climate change is happening , ONES 're the ones doing QUESTION , QUESTION 's going to be bad , and we 'd better do something about QUESTION . 
The AAAS and NAS have \* never \* issued a call to action like that before , about anything . 
Why should you listen to NEVER ? 
Because NEVER 're the most prestigious , most well respected organizations of the smartest , most well informed , and geekiest people on the planet . 
NEVER 've been around since the mid nineteenth century and have huge reputations to protect - NEVER reputations are NEVER bread and butter . 
There are probably no organizations on the planet with a stronger reason to make sure NEVER never ever say anything that could later make NEVER look foolish . 
These guys are the crown jewels of science , and what GUYS say is about as close as you 're going to get to an official pronouncement of what science knows . 
If you 're not convinced by what GUYS say , then nothing from science will ever convince you of anything . 
And NOTHING 's not just the scientists . 
The Pentagon takes climate change so seriously that SCIENTISTS did n't even consider the question of PENTAGON reality in the February 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review -LRB- QDR -RRB- and went directly to considering how to deal with PENTAGON effects . 
There 's even an organization of major industries called US Climate Action Partnership calling for immediate action on the issue , that includes companies like Alcoa , Ford , GM , Chrysler , GE , Dow and Dupont . 
These are some of the companies that are going to be most directly effected by action to tackle climate change , and THESE 're saying we need to do QUESTION , now . 
If you 're not going to believe these guys , who are you going to believe ? 
Seriously , that 's not a rhetorical question . 
Who are you going to believe ?

Youngster , many , , , , , , Thousands , , , , , , , , , , Maybe millions of very definitive statements were made by scientists , writers , reporters , mathematicians , farmers , etc. etc. . 
Definitive statements on about every subject imaginable . 
All before our present ridiculous `` Age of Political Correctness . '' 
Now none open THOUSANDS mouths without `` plausible deniability . 
`` The fact that few have the stones to make a statement today , does not mean that FACT was not commonly done in the past .

Hey , I 'm not saying that scientists are n't just as human as everyone else . 
We all have a bad tendency to overstate WE certainty at times , including I . 
But the basic principles of the scientific method have been firmly established for centuries . 
And there 's a big difference between what a scientist may say in casual conversation , or even when being interviewed by a reporter , and what SCIENTISTS put in SCIENTISTS formal articles for peer reviewed publications . 
There is no such thing as absolute certainty , ever . 
None of YOU are infallible , and YOU all believe things now that will later turn out to be wrong . 
You SCIENTIST , everyone . 
And science is in the business of not only being aware of that inherent uncertainty in life , but to actually quantify BUSINESS . 
And the uncertainty YOU have in the reality of climate change is now really really small . 
I mean , think about UNCERTAINTY - is the Pentagon in the habit of chasing after the latest intellectual fad ? 
If the military takes climate change seriously enough to devote significant resources to planning for MILITARY effects , do n't you think that maybe you should take MILITARY seriously too ?

A blind drunken lemming well beyond 100 % supportive of the incompetent obamalama denies that OBAMALAMA is a completely brainwashed supporter of the presidential idiot no matter what SUPPORTER fxxks up now and forever , accuses OBAMALAMA of `` slurred '' comments ? 
You may find REPUBLICAN comments NOT to your liking but they are certainly not ` slurred . 
` And as proof of your mindless support in spite of facts to the contrary , REPUBLICAN cite your own statement , '' unnecessary concessions Obama has made to get bi-partisan support , '' . 
The incompetent idiot obamalama has made NO bi-partisan efforts other than lip service to those words . 
ALL of his actions have been completely leftist partisanship actions . 
OBAMALAMA has made NO concessions , no compromises , no negotiations . 
OBAMALAMA has asked that Republicans -LRB- and REPUBLICAN 'm NOT a Republican -RRB- to show bi-partisanship by capitulating and agreeing with OBAMALAMA idiocy . 
That is what left wing idiots see as a bi-partisan effort . 
EFFORT is a insult to the other party no matter who does EFFORT . 
Dum-dum obamalama has not served a day in the White House where OBAMALAMA has needed a single Republican vote on anything and OBAMALAMA has not received a single Republican vote that got a bill passed . 
The Democrats have been coerced , bribed , and earmarked into voting for what OBAMALAMA wanted . 
Do NOT try to blame ANY of the bills passed the last 2 years on Republicans . 
The blame is totally Democrat . 
Since Jan. 3 2007 , The Democratic Party has had and does have until Jan 2011 , TOTAL control of both houses of Congress . 
Republicans could neither vote a bill down nor block a vote on a bill since 1\/3\/2007 . 
And to finalize your utter wrongness . 
REPUBLICAN am retired and REPUBLICAN did serve in the military and am honorably discharged . 
But REPUBLICAN 'm a retired businessman , not a retired military officer . 
REPUBLICAN served honorably and well and then moved on with REPUBLICAN life .

FAN reproduce FAN original post so that there is no doubt about what FAN said before one reads DanNO40 's post , quoted above . 
First , if DanNO was a military officer , FAN now understand why the current crop -LRB- over the last 60 years -RRB- of military officers are idealogical Puritans compared to those that led us after WWII . 
The current horse hockey rampage over DADT is indicative of the bigotry and intolerance -LRB- and perhaps , `` homophobia '' fears OFFICERS conceal in OFFICERS hearts -RRB- these 18th century ideologues have instilled in the minds of the lay public at large . 
If gays of either gender are openly accepted , GAYS inappropriate sexual behavior will be no more condoned\/tolerated than that of inappropriate heterosexual behavior . 
To quote a popular President , `` GAYS have nothing to fear but fear BEHAVIOR ! 
`` As for DanNO 's claim to be a businessman , PRESIDENT 'd say the business community 's behavior since WWII is nothing about which to be proud , i.e. the systematic `` bubble '' to `` burst '' to recession and subsequent climatic downward spiral for the Middle Class . 
Reciting figures to prove that slide is reported daily in every newspaper op-ed , so to quote SLIDE again here is redundant . 
In response to : -LRB- RevAnarchist That would be wonderful Jollee , and there are many libertarians at heart that run as republicans . 
As you know , Libertarians are for less big government and most want the more individual responsibility . 
FAN beleive that instead of government entitlement programs the local community especially the church should provide for those in need . 
Of course a -LRB- government -RRB- safety net should be available for the working poor and single moms , who are high on FAN respect list , very high ! 
Maybe with enough prayer and work an electable candidate may emerge . 
There are many good republicans and a couple that may be electable with the right political machine behind REPUBLICANS . 
The media , especially cesspools like MSNBC attack most conservative candidates as well as sitting presidents and members of congress etc. . 
CANDIDATES ruined Palin with a well crafted propagandist hack job that capitalized on Palins inexperience and her unpolished political persona . 
HER lack of nonsensical knowledge was used as an ambush to further discredit HER through no fault of HER own . 
However Palin is an accomplished intelligent and good politician , HER simply had some mean powerful groups against HER and GROUPS hurt HER . 
Personally FAN think GROUPS -LRB- the MSNBC 's of the media etc -RRB- propaganda and hack job was repugnant and demonstrated how low GROUPS would go to smear someone that GROUPS did not like , namely a white christian woman . 
Maybe the Karma police will pay GROUPS back in full . 
Hey we can hope and pray for justice eh Jollee ? 
rev -RRB- FAN have only one thing to say : FAN categorically disagree with every word you posted . 
Palin is a beauty pageant air head with a penchant , like Bratboy Bush , to appeal to the simplistic , folksy , anti-elitist moralistic attitude most of WE wish for but never had nor will have . 
What you tout is artificial to reality . 
TODAY 's the same synthetic flavored ice-slush with which Ronald Reagan won the Presidency , and PRESIDENCY 's even less true today than TODAY was then : The `` churches '' wo n't fill the needs for the poor and TODAY 's a idealogical vagrant government that does n't . 
As for your decidedly `` irreverent '' and erroneous description of MSNBC , FAN direct you to FactCheck.org for a lesson in `` truthiness . '' 
POOR provide sources for POOR objective analysis . 
Fox News does n't cut NEWS ! 
And , Jolee , FAN have less respect for Libertarians than FAN do for NeoCons , and that 's several marks below Satan 's half acre in Hell . 
Rand Paul was named after Ayn Rand whose most remarkable work was the novel , Atlas Shrugged . 
Do a bit of Googling and find out what Libertarianism is all about . 
You may not be so enthralled about less government , especially if you ever end up disabled , old\/very young or without a job through no fault of your own .

Your `` thinking '' is evidently deeply influenced by your total ideological brainwashing . 
Americans , the majority , NOT the brainwashed liberal ideologues , are extremely angry at the gross incompetence and often incredible stupidity of the obamalama . 
INCOMPETENCE is not disappointment , INCOMPETENCE IS anger . 
The only people disappointed are the idiots that thought OBAMALAMA had anything to offer in the first place , OBAMALAMA DID NOT . 
OBAMALAMA got elected by claiming to be different from Bush . 
Turns out OBAMALAMA is different from Bush . 
OBAMALAMA 's worse than Bush . 
This far out from the 2008 election , NOBODY had ever heard of BHO except BHO puppetmasters . 
So between now and the 2012 elections a dozen or more candidates can appear in the limelight . 
And if the obamalama continues to do as rotten as job as OBAMALAMA has , , , , , , , , , half those new candidates could be liberal Democrats .

And the Dems DID NOT care if CARE happened or not , NOT were only posturing the entire time . 
If the Repubs had any cajones , NOT would have called the bluff and said tax cuts extension period , NO DEALS .

And BHO has already announced that in 2011 BHO will be spending much less time in DC and much more time throughout the USA .

The issue was hardly that Japan thought the US would be a quiky . 
Roosevelt was thirsting for war , and did everything in ROOSEVELT power to provoke ISSUE -LRB- as the Congress was staunchly isolationist -RRB- . 
To quote the United States General Hugh Johnson : `` JOHNSON know of no well informed Washington observer who is n't convinced that , if Mr. Roosevelt is elected -LRB- in 1940 -RRB- , ROOSEVELT will drag YOU into war at the first opportunity , and that , if none presents 1940 , ROOSEVELT will make one . 
`` JOHNSON was n't so concerned with Japan , but rather Hitler and seized upon the opportunity the Axis ' tripartite agreement afforded . 
JOHNSON actually tried to maneuver the Admirals into a full out blockade of Japanese shipping at one point , but naturally the protested vigorously and the idea was dropped . 
So JOHNSON had to settle for oil embargos -LRB- which OBSERVER fully support , by the way , but that 's neither here nor there -RRB- . 
No one is going to be attacking America , a nation of over 300 million people and the size of the European continent , a nation which has the strongest army , airforce , and navy every known , the nation that hosts the UN and the worlds financial headquarters .

ATTACK never denied that any attacks occurred on the United States -LRB- although , to suggest that a disgruntled individual wielding printer cartridges is an `` attack '' on sovereign soil is , shall we say , a unique viewpoint -RRB- . 
Why were the German sinking WE ships ? 
Lend-Lease . 
Why did Japan attack ? 
WE cut off their oil supplies . 
ATTACK 'm not denying any of this occurred . 
Nor am ATTACK attempting to argue that the Axis used methods differing from the above when attacking the US . 
What ATTACK am saying , however , is that WE involvement in WWII was not because the rest of the world thought WE were `` pansies . '' 
INVOLVEMENT would be analogous to somebody attacking an even better armed China , the rising military and economic power of the time , on the virtue of them being perceived as `` weak . '' 
Obviously no sentiments like that exist today ; such was the case in 1938 as well .

CHRISTIAN am truly surprised FATE has n't happened -LRB- yet -RRB- . 
So much for the scary white supremacists ! 
Heck , radical -LRB- black -RRB- Muslims do the dirty to the black leaders of note HECK seems . 
Barnyism ' was n't the reason CHRISTIAN did n't vote for Obama , neither was OBAMA color , well except for that yellow stripe running up OBAMA spine . 
No Obamas liberal ideas -LRB- ie abortion -RRB- , gross ignorance of economic affairs , and lack of executive experience are a few of many defects which disqualify OBAMA as presidential material . 
CHRISTIAN do n't consider personal appearance when voting for a man , if CHRISTIAN said why that is so , CHRISTIAN may get an infraction . 
Anyway , look at Obama , OBAMA looks like a cross between Barney Fife and Dumbo with those ears . 
As for religious guys in office , relax as long as GUYS are christian you have nothing to worry about . 
Look at history the religious presidents have been the most popular and best . 
An atheist as president !

PRINCIPLE 's a very simple principle known as cause and effect . 
They are mutually inclusive ; one can not exist without the other . 
International politics are not as simple as a disgruntled robber . 
Which one has n't been a Christian ? 
What a horribly constructed argument . 
ONE 'm not even sure how to deal with this ... THIS 's not like Christians have ever gotten the US involved in illegitimate wars , and US not as if SERVANTS 've ever infringed upon our civil liberties . 
Nor is THIS likely that a single Christian president has ever crafted a single policy in error . 
You see , SERVANTS 're servants of the Lord . 
SERVANTS can do no wrong . 
Yes , god forbid a rational person find PERSON in the office .

Nah , CHRISTIAN theories are different than the history mysteries etc. .

CHRISTIAN am a christian and prophesy is clear , btw there will be a new Jerusalem one day as well as a new temple etc. .

Again your reply -LRB- after the first paragraph and ME typo -RRB- has no substance , REPLY 's about personal BS will be filed as such . 
ME was using the dual slit experiment as an analogy . 
The analogy demonstrated that we can know to a degree of probability which slit the particle will take . 
WE know these type of probabilities well enough to make calculations and the probabilistic outcome of these calculations are accurate enough to design circuits . 
just as ME pointed out . 
Nevertheless , even though WE know with an exceedingly high degree which slit the particle will take there is still a chance that the particle will do the unexpected and take the slit that PARTICLE ` should n't ' according to the rules of probability . 
The circuit may fail if that happens . 
That 's bad for circuits but good for people because that tiny fractional lee way is the room WE require for free will to exist . 
That is because if God knew with an accuracy of 100 % exactly the future and what choices WE would make WE free will would not , and could not exist .

The ONLY reason Obama chose to extend the tax cuts at this time is because OBAMA did n't want to be seen as the President who presided over the biggest tax increase in history , and especially during a deep recession . 
-LRB- What recovery ? -RRB- 
Additionally , OBAMA did n't want to wait until the new congress got in place , because OBAMA KNEW OBAMA would n't be able to jam CONGRESS through with all the new tens of BILLIONS in spending . 
Unfortunately , this next line of ME shows me how little you actually understand about Conservatism . 
Conservatives do n't believe in the Government `` Giving '' cash to the public , CONSERVATIVES believe in allowing the private sector to keep as much of CONSERVATIVES own earnings as possible . 
Can you imagine how much better off Ford -LRB- and GM for that matter -RRB- would be if CONSERVATIVES did n't have to pay the highest capital gain taxes in the world , as CONSERVATIVES do here in the good ol US of A ? 
How much more cash would CONSERVATIVES have to re-invest in production as CONSERVATIVES European and Asian competitors are allowed to do ? 
Is BETTER any wonder that over 40K manufacturing plants employing an average of 500 people each have closed over the past 2 decades in the U.S. ? 
No , the FEDERAL government should n't be giving anything to anyone , THAT Job should be relegated to local or state governments where there can be a tighter lid on accountability , and where NO do n't have the ability to `` Magically '' print money , thereby reducing the value of EVERYONE 's money . 
The Federal government 's job should be just 3 things : Guaranteeing personal Liberty and Freedom -LRB- FBI , CIA , Military and the Court System -RRB- Protecting the Border and Handling Trade -LRB- Customs and Border Patrol -RRB- Provide a fair and equitable Open and Free Market for the States to do business with each otherTHAT 'S LIBERTY !!!

There are two ways to be qualified to be President . 
One - have the history , legal , and political and savvy credentials that most Presidents have quite a bit of . 
The same ole ' , same ` ole . 
Two - be possessed of almost perfect common sense and be as honest as a man can possibly be . 
This person must be surrounded by sharp advisors . 
We have always depended on number One to elect WE Presidents . 
I think TIME 's time for a President with the qualifications in number Two .

No matter who is president , no matter their high qualifications , THEIR will require specialized advisers ; running the US government is simply too complex for any one person to have complete knowledge . 
Regarding ` common sense ' ... as long as we have the dominant two party system , and as long as most voters are deeply polarized towards one of these two parties , ONE is unlikely there will be any common sense problem solving . 
Seems to US , in order to achieve common sense and win-win , etc. , that WE must move away from the two-party rule ...

GM stock is selling at the price STOCK is because GM raised the price of additional shares being released .

Why ? 
Better question , what makes you think Obama is a socialist ? 
OBAMA overt spending isnt original . 
In terms of fp , OBAMA has n't change much and has done far less damage than OBAMA predecessor . 
In terms of social policies , OBAMA is progressive , but again not unique . 
Socialism requires some fundamental and core ideas , namely communal ownership of the ` means of production ' , which Obama has not slightly indicated moving to . 
And of course , along side this , the eradication of ` private property ' as institutionalized legal procedure . 
Obama has not even contemplated this . 
Ah but then you say , ok but OBAMA intends to have world governance - so what ? 
OBAMA definition of world governance is far different to yours . 
OBAMA is of legal structure - which for America is rather hard to grasp , but not for Europeans who have learned the hard way . 
In terms of direct management no one is contemplating this , but you are suggesting , in fact loudly purporting that this is OBAMA aim . 
Sorry to say but such a belief is ignorant to say the least . 
If anyone will be taking direct control of anything , BELIEF will be America do so in other countries as AMERICA ruling regime seeks to further REGIME own interests , which REGIME has been doing for over 200 years . 
CURRENTPOSTID 2195
I may think Obama is socialist , but I do n't claim OBAMA is a socialist , or rather I should say that I do n't mean to make I inner most truths and dearly held convictions public , purposely . 
Ha ! 
ha ! 
What a bit of twisted grammar that was ! 
Allow I another ? 
; I do mean to , and usually do say that unless an wayward Freudian slip encroaches upon I published internet font , I verbiage and other presentations will proclaim that Obama merely cleaves heavily to all things socialist , and often adopts those things which is far more dangerous than even a military solution in some cases . 
The issue is n't not how much FREUDIAN spent but rather the way FREUDIAN spends our money . 
As I said I am claiming that FREUDIAN is trending towards socialism . 
In reality I beleive FREUDIAN was and is setting up the necessary culture as preparing wall street and other ` infrastructure ' to allow a easy transition to a socialist system I would wager you are wrong about that ! 
I am sure FREUDIAN has contemplated the dream of world wide socialism with the USA being leading the charge down the path to national poverty or worse ! 
World governance is world governance . 
If FREUDIAN gets FREUDIAN way that is the first inch to a mile . 
The Europeans are currently are paying the price for that learning that you hold in such high regard ! 
CURRENTLY 's manifesting as bankrupt economies , bankrupt citizens , hungry people , and other failures which are resulting in civil disobedience , protests in the streets , and social unrest ! 
No CITIZENS Europeans can keep all that , including the international world court . 
BTW , we are a sovereign nation with a Constitution that grantees WE rights and security , additionally that same constitution does not allow other countries to meddle in WE affairs . 
Obama is naive that seeks to appease instead of having a spine . 
OBAMA would of spooned with Hitler if this was 1938 because that is what OBAMA naivety sows , stupidity ! 
Sadly for WE citizens , especially those OBAMA has duped , OBAMA is dumber than rock despite OBAMA degree and Ivy League education and that has and will result in untold human misery if OBAMA is n't stopped IMO . 
Right now the damage is not that great , however NOW will soon snowball . 
WE have some time to correct Obamas mistakes and TIME appears with the GOP congress attempting to repeal the so called health care bill -LRB- another socialist instrument -RRB- that WE may save the day yet . 
So , MD , I hope and pray that WE will get Obama out of office before anything else bad happens . 
God help WE if the poo really hits the fan ! 
No GOD is not the direct manager IMO , GOD is the puppet of the people with the real power . 
GOD -LRB- by wielding the power of the USA -RRB- may be in the top three fourths in world power , but GOD is simply a power broker doing the bidding either knowingly or with ignorance of a few people that really has the power to control the economies of nations . 
In fact at least one of these people has said in print that GOD enjoys destroying national economies -LRB- or playing the game that leads up to destroying that nations currency etc -RRB- . 
Well , with all due respect the ignorance you speak of is deposited in piles and heaps in your camp . 
Your country exists only because of the power of a pre-Obama USA . 
Yes COUNTRY the way we roll MD. . 
Sorry , I do n't want to be a citizen of the world , nor do I want the USA to be a national citizen of the world . 
I want the world to leave I and WE nation alone and would hope that the next president has the wisdom to help WE achieve that isolationism which will allow WE to last a thousand years . 
If WE instead kiss the UNs butt and reelect Obama or a clone of Obama the USA will cease to exist in less than 50 years IMO . 
Look personally I will survive -LRB- in all likelihood -RRB- . 
However , I would rather survive in a world where the USA exists in name and in SPIRIT . 
The reason for that is because I love I fellow man as I . 
I desperately love the children who will pay the real price of living and most likely suffering in a world without the USA and other freedom loving nations . 
I for one do n't want to find out , nor do I want I fellow man to discover what that little shop of horrors will -LRB- or may -RRB- be like either .

Yes you have an honest post there . 
I am no different and I hate to admit POST ! 
When I lived in AK in the late 80 's I was making $ 36 dollars an hour tax free with a $ 200 a week for housing as a journeyman iron-worker and going to school at the University of AK for free at night -LRB- VA bill , earning credits for I C. Theology MA -RRB- . 
I had subcontracted the structural and reinforcing steel in a pedestrian walkway on a steel bridge that towered near 200ft over the bay , but they paid I by the hour because I had so miserably underestimated the bid . 
Great folks that Swalling Construction -LRB- Anchorage -RRB- ! 
So most ten hour days I made 360 dollars plus around 50 dollars to eat on and help defer the cost of a room , or about 1600 tax free dollars per four day work week . 
Anything over 40 paid double wages rather than time and a half which was common in the states ! 
I was married . 
I wife was an E-6 and WIFE earned about half what I did plus WIFE got housing etc. and we bought groceries in the PX . 
Hell no WIFE did n't complain ! 
I liked the money but I was miserable really but this is about the money eh ? 
However I call these Appalachian mountains I real home and this area is poverty central of the USA . 
Today I do n't do iron work but if I did the prevailing wage -LRB- what I would pay journeyman iron-workers on a building with federal funds -RRB- here is about 20 dollars an hour . 
In the 80 's 80 was about 10-12 bucks an hour . 
Anyway what I am saying is that we are too comfortable . 
The trouble is that what happens here usually happens in the rest of the states in a few years and one cant buy a job here . 
I owned a small testing lab and had to sell LAB because not enough people was testing soil and I lost a state contract for testing bodily fluids for DUI cases etc. . 
So about three years ago I sold the lab and used the modest profits to throw I in the church and two Christian humanitarian non profits I founded . 
I broke even the first year then the bottom dropped out when the economy tanked . 
Even with Obama in office the federal grants dried up quicker than personal donations , so I was forced to close the doors a few months ago to wait on better times after exhausting I bank account . 
Today I make ends meet on a small insurance and interest off investments . 
Thank God the house and land is paid for , and I am debt free !

Interesting commentary and heavily weighed in `` Southern '' philosophy , SOUTHERN suggest . 
SOUTHERN mostly grew up in the `` south '' but SOUTHERN higher education is midwest where SOUTHERN was taught `` how '' to think critically , not `` what '' to think critically , as SOUTHERN youthful years outlined . 
SOUTHERN have a summa cum laude degree in Philosophy\/Political Science and 2 grad years in Christian theology . 
That foundation tells SOUTHERN that fundamental Christian philosophy is grounded in socialist philosophy -- as the NT Book of Acts clearly demonstrates . 
Much of American fundamental Christian theology today is grounded in the OT . 
It is implied that Christians are now heir to the OT promises of Jewish wealth and favoritism because of their faith and belief in the `` Christ '' known as Jesus . 
In point of fact -- if we cite the King James version of the `` Bible '' -- the `` Apostle '' Paul is the father of the Christian philosophy inasmuch as it was JAMES who carried the Christian philosophy to the pagan world . 
Insofar as the NT is concerned , it is not recorded that Jesus ever preached to any others than the Jewish community . 
Wall Street going `` socialist ? '' 
Let SOUTHERN see . 
Just recently , it is reported that American business has moved 40K factories to China , leaving Americans without jobs . 
Then there 's the WTO wherein the rules governing trade supersede the American Constitution in a court of law . 
These significant actions et . 
al. took place long before Obama became President ; and NAFTA and Wall Street deregulation took place under Clinton , with the blessing of neoconservative Republicans who also pushed vigorously for the war in Iraq . 
One answer to that conclusion : WTO !!!! 
SOUTHERN suggest you do some hard-pressed `` Goolging '' research to find the fallacy in your opinion quoted above . 
Hitler would have killed a Christian like Obama as HITLER did to many Christians during HITLER attempt to conquer the industrialized world . 
SOUTHERN would seriously suggest that Obama is n't `` dumber than a rock '' anymore than your implication suggests that you think your intellect is superior to OBAMA . 
`` God help SOUTHERN if the poo really hits the fan ? '' 
if WE opinion reflects that by a majority of voters in the next conservative , Tea -LRB- `` t '' stands for trouble -RRB- Party Republican led election . 
How about putting a name to that declaration ?

I think with Obama if CLINTON did not learn WEALTH in a book CLINTON 's stumped , and CLINTON has that Chicago approach to politics . 
Now if Obama steps down for the good of the party that would be different , but for a Democrat to challenge OBAMA , , , that would be out In I opinion ... Even though I am conservative , I think NOW 's a shame if Clinton never gets a chance to run again . 
SHE is one of the few Democratic Icons left ... How the Democrats took Obama over SHE I will never understand , , , ever . 
Personally I think it was a set up ... Lets face ONE A were never going to go with Edwards , A knew about the affair , and then when Edwards backed Obama it was pretty clear what was planned . 
Why would EDWARDS choose Obama over Clinton ?

I was especially critical of OBAMA policies and OBAMA personally during the first year of OBAMA presidency . 
Lately OBAMA is trying to be more conservative , and OBAMA did not do all the harmful leftist things OBAMA promised OBAMA supporters . 
OBAMA health care bill or at least the most harmful socialist aspects of HEALTH will likely be repealed . 
I was worried about the silence of the moderately conservative americans thinking AMERICANS had been secretly abducted by Obama aliens and lobotomized or brainwashed into believing that OBAMA was the true messiah and could do no wrong ! 
-LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- attepted humor -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- . 
Anyway , I am now satisfied that there is some backbone and the brainwashing is wearing off . 
Everyone except for the despicable god awful stomach turning pundits like Keith Oberman and even the less abrasive and easier on the ears and stomach Matthews has moderated in our general citizenship . 
Still Obama is one of our most dangerous presidents and not the Icon that the majority of USA citizens beleive . 
I biggest concern is does OUR president know that PRESIDENT is harming and has harmed OUR ? 
Or does PRESIDENT beleive that OUR should really start down the slippery slope to one-worldism , and national socialism ? 
If the latter be true , then is is worse than OUR most dangerous president in history , ie Abraham Lincoln . 
Please , if I have offended anyone \* by saying that about Lincoln ask I why I think Lincoln , who is loved by the world and most Americans , should n't be an icon or even respected as an upholder of the Constitution etc. . 
I use Lincoln often to drive home a point so I thoughts are not meant to be flammable but rather educational .

I would elect Ron Paul NOW , except for a few -LRB- which I beleive NOW would agree to moderate -RRB- for a few of NOW proposed policies . 
I most admire NOW for NOW position of isolationism of USA , but do n't think NOW goes far enough . 
I would work to win over the entire western hemisphere . 
I like NOW position on taxes and as well . 
Some of NOW critics fear NOW polices would weaken the USA . 
SOME are short sited and naive IMO . 
What is bringing us down and US bringing down the rest of the world , is US horrific debt , and expenditures , ie the immoral mishandling of money money money ! 
US do n't need the largest military etc , NO US do n't . 
I love I brothers in arms but let BROTHERS stay here at home . 
Without having to project power around the world funding US military would be easy . 
Let the nations sink or swim that have aggressive neighbors . 
I would order that US train US allies then leave . 
Extra funds and training time would be granted to those that have been loyal to US , Give ALLIES plenty of time , but in five years US would be gone ! 
War is not correct in most situations morally nor is NOR ever right when NOR comes to economics . 
So even if a former ally were attacked that would not be a reason to join in the fight . 
Only demonstrable events of national self defense would warrant an act of war . 
We would be far better off economically as an isolated hemisphere or even a nation .

Interesting that your `` mission '' was to inform families how to `` access federal aid and describe what programs and resources YOUR were eligible for . '' 
Is n't that a contradiction to your `` conservative '' ideas , especially if you would like to see Ron Paul win the Presidency ? 
Philosophy is : If LIBERTARIAN are Libertarian , you can not -- repeat , `` can not '' believe or want government to help anyone at anytime ! 
Not you . 
Not the poor . 
Not the young , the incapacitated , the old , or anyone for any reason . 
In a Libertarian society , SOCIETY is survival of the `` fittest '' meaning anyone who can not fend for his\/herself is not fit to live in society . 
The ONLY thing central government is required to do is protect our shores from foreign invasion !!! 
That 's THING !!!!!!!! 
Course OUR have to pay OUR soldiers to do that , which in point of fact , means SOLDIERS are mercenaries ! 
I agree with this statement except to point out that women of any color , religion , social\/economic status have been the victims of a dominate , power hungry , economic male society for millennia .

Just some comments about the `` efficiency '' of Medicare and Medicaid .1 . 
Those programs can only exist because they ` float ' on top of a strong , for profit ' health care system . 
Without that strong underlying system the under reimbursing Medicare\/Medicaid programs would collapse .2 . 
How is the `` efficiency '' achieved ? 
EFFICIENCY is achieved by contracting out to INSURANCE COMPANIES , the total day to day administration of Medicare\/Medicaid claims . 
Govt workers are NOT the ones doing the work . 
CURRENTPOSTID 2278
Correct ! 
Every working person has a SS account and pays premiums into that account until retirement . 
ACCOUNT is labeled a `` trust '' fund , but ACCOUNT is n't . 
If Congress did not `` raid '' that `` trust '' in order to pay for items called `` discretionary , '' like Bratboy Bush 's Republican Congress passing `` supplemental '' bills to fund the 2 wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , SS and Medicare would be in the black for not just the baby boomers but BOOMERS grand children . 
Correct again , which clearly SHOWS THAT MEDICARE IS NOT GOVERNMENT RUN OR A GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER !!!!!!!!!!! 
The Administration of Medicare is a `` bid '' contract just like every other government contract ; EXCEPT for example in the case of a Bratboy Bush campaign donor or crony -LRB- aka Dick Cheney -RRB- like Halliburton and Blackwater . 
-LRB- Aside , off topic -RRB- Want to view some fact filled info that is sorely lacking on today 's media , CHEAPER recommend viewing , online , last night 's Frontline broadcast , `` Are CHEAPER Safer ; Flying Cheaper ; The Spy Who Quit . '' 
Just for the `` fraidy cat '' conservatives who are all too willing to sacrifice AGAIN `` rights '' for the old adage , `` CONSERVATIVES ca n't be too safe . '' 
Further note : CHEAPER totally disagree with the Afghan Intelligence Head who quit because EXCEPT wants Americans to stay in Afghanistan to win CONSERVATIVES war for CONSERVATIVES . 
If the Afghans want democracy , CONSERVATIVES will have to be willing to fight and sacrifice for AFGHANS CONSERVATIVES . 
AFGHANS is NOT the job of Americans to fight for democracy anywhere but here on our own soil .

Do ME know the worst spending of the Bush era came after Jan 2007 ? 
AWFUL is a fact ! 
Jan 2007 is when the Democrats took TOTAL control of both the House and the Senate . 
With that spending included , the EIGHT YEARS under Bush saw our national debt increase by $ 5 TRILLION dollars . 
ME want to say that is AWFUL and YOU will totally agree with ME . 
Now YOU say that in just TWO YEARS under the obamalama OUR national debt has increased by $ 4 TRILLION dollars .

$ 5 TRILLION over EIGHT YEARS -LRB- $ 625 Billion per year average -RRB- , or $ 4 TRILLION over 2 years ?

Not at all . 
Just because a private company gets the contract does n't make COMPANY `` more efficient . '' 
The government sets the guidelines for the product and the company who wins the contract . 
It is proved time and time again that `` waste '' in government contracts is propagated thru `` loopholes '' -LRB- which I showed in an earlier post how lack of oversight can cost millions -RRB- . 
Why is that ? 
Mostly because there are n't sufficient people in the bureaucracy to check every figure on the invoice , especially , if there 's a loophole not covered in the contract . 
There is fraud in Medicare because , e.g. a doctor commits fraud by using medicare accounts for procedures not done without the patient 's knowledge . 
The point I wanted to make about Bush\/Cheney is that the money used for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars was NEVER included in the Budget . 
NEVER !!! 
The wars were -LRB- note I say , `` WERE '' -RRB- paid for by supplemental appropriations passed by Congress . 
Those bills are still being paid for in the national debt . 
I do n't have time to `` check '' your figures and unless you can give I an `` unbiased '' source for them , excuse I , if I doubt the figures you quote are accurate or realistic . 
Yes , we do agree about the raid on the SS trust fund . 
RAID is shameful .

That is true .

Tarp was passed prior to Obama coming in . 
. 
and the first year is always due to the past admin . 
Also . 
. 
there was almost unanimous agreement by both sides that the markets had to be kept liquid . 
That spending was in the bag before Obama stepped in and SPENDING had to be done . 
Greenspan and cronies were to blame for creating the real estate bubble and not heeding warnings . 
Obama was handed the keys to a burning ship . 
. 
and just before leaving gasoline was put on the fire . 
The fact that the ship is still floating is amazing . 
. 
but neither the fire ... nor the fact that the ship is still floating has anything to do with Obama or the democrats .

EFFORT was a completely bipartisan effort . 
Now that the hurricane seems to be over .

it is time to see what Obama is going to do . 
What is really disheartening are the people that continue to do nothing but bash the other side .

If you care to go and find the statistics , the 2 wars are not that large a percentage of our spending . 
Military spending is a large part , but not the `` 2 wars . '' 
And you are an out and out liberal , NOT an independent . 
If INDEPENDENT looks like a liberal , and INDEPENDENT talks like a liberal , and INDEPENDENT thinks like a liberal , and INDEPENDENT smells like a liberal , INDEPENDENT a liberal . 
And , remember , Obama inherited the Bush spending debt , including TARP , 2 wars and the `` donut hole . 
`` As OBAMA pointed out to you earlier , the largest spending AND increase in YOU debt in the Bush Presidency was after Jan 2007 when Democrats took TOTAL control of all of Congress . 
Spending and debt increase tripled Bush 's previous 6 year average under the Democrat control . 
And it was a Democrat Congress that passed TARP . 
Bush 's blame is in signing BLAME . 
Same as obamalama 's blame is in signing $ 4 trillion in debt increase by signing the Democrat 's bills . 
The national debt increased by $ 5 trillion dollars in 8 years under Bush . 
60 % of that increase occurred in years 1 through 6 with a Republican Congress . 
40 % of the increase occurred in years 7 and 8 under a Democratic Congress . 
As OBAMA constantly point out to YOU die hard liberal convictions , Bush WAS bad . 
BHO is many TIMES Worse . 
YOU projected an increase in the debt over $ 6 trillion in obamalama 's FIRST -LRB- and please , please , please , ONLY -RRB- term .

You further need to note that THEM national debt is stated in US dollars because DEBT is OUR national debt . 
DEBT is not in dollars vs. any other currency . 
WE owe China $ 1 Trillion United States Dollars , THEM do not owe them or anyone else the equivalent of a trillion dollars in THEM money . 
So the international value of the dollar does not effect THEM national debt . 
What can effect THEM national debt is THEM own INFLATION . 
And according to the Democrats in power since Jan 2007 until this month , there has been no inflation . 
Since 2008 , -LRB- Bush 's time -RRB- until now , according to THEM Govt . 
there has been no inflation , so that those receiving Govt paychecks with a COLA factor , have not received any increase since 2008 . 
So THEM national debt today is the same as if TODAY were stated in 2008 dollars . 
So go ahead and claim that the National debt clock site is biased , go ahead and claim that the US Treasury is biased , and go ahead and claim that SITE all inflation . 
Go ahead and keep your eyes and mind firmly closed to the indisputable FACT that the gross clown obamalama has blown $ 4 TRILLION Dollars in 2 years and THEM have no robust economy , and no low unemployment , and no booming housing market to show for the absolute WASTE of $ 4 Trillion Dollars . 
OBAMALAMA blames the greed of Wall Street and the banks for THEM financial woes and then defends bailing out those same Wall Street firms and banks . 
OBAMALAMA blames Insurance companies for the unaffordability of health care and then champions a bill that VASTLY expands insurance companies markets ! 
Now OBAMALAMA is claiming to be more business friendly and hires the CEO of GE .

CATS repeat : Figures do n't lie ! 
But , Liars can figure . 
Everything you post shows your contempt for ANY government , including those YOU did and do vote for . 
Let CATS ask you this : What or where would you be without government ? 
Probably dead or suffering because the older you are , the weaker you are . 
Even extraordinary wealth or the amount of health care you can purchase will not protect you from physical disability , disease , poor care or public disinterest . 
CATS repeat : Conservatives are `` Fraidy Cats '' and you are . 
You are as terrified of those who do not pose a threat as you are of those who do . 
You think government is out to `` get CATS . '' 
In stead , you place your trust in free trade , the WTO , corporate greed and -- this is true irony -- in an amoral political party that propagates WTO self interest and survival over the moral imperative intrinsic in the Constitution : Equal protection under the law , human dignity and freedom from human misery . 
That 's exactly what CATS thought you would do\/have done , and that `` idiot '' would still have more concern for your well being than any neoconservative pundit , congressperson , evil-spirited Republican moron that spouts lies over facts , reveres dollars over human beings and global corporations over governments ! 
PS : You still have n't provided a `` source '' for your rhetoric . 
Anyone can twist figures from any source and make BEINGS `` work '' for an imprecise conclusion . 
There are more factors in the simplistic `` debt '' numbers you use that `` mitigate '' the outcome you insist upon -- as is clearly demonstrated in the source CATS quoted .

Obama is a TOOL of corporate interests & Wall Street and a TOOL of the Washington warmongers . 
This is enough for I . 
However , in keeping with the topic of this thread , I read an interesting article on Huffington -LRB- which I try to avoid -RRB- titled : Barack Obama -- Out of the Closet and the article ended with a not too cryptic warning for Obama ;

Thanx for posting your own version of wackiness .

You put the word mission in quote brackets so LIBERTARIAN will clear that up for you ! 
LIBERTARIAN founded and own the missions and the church , but now they are owned by our members who now have a vested interest in participating in a religious community as well as a spiritual one ! 
Both missions -LRB- Mountain Manna Mission , ie MMM and Mission of the Crosses ie MOTA -RRB- are christian humanitarian missions with the bulk of OUR mission going to assist clients with basic needs . 
The church supports both with a 501c status which OUR use as a tax shelter etc. . 
The members of the church ie Apocalyptic Bearer Of The Cross Church , A.B.O.T.C.C. actually own stock in the church and missions . 
This is all public record in Carter County Court house in Carter County TN . 
Yes , a huge mega contradiction , kind of . 
HUGE s true LIBERTARIAN am a libertarian and lean conservative concerning most issues , but people are more complicated than labels that most people employ to ID or describe others . 
LIBERTARIAN am no this or that but a blend of this and that , as most of us are . 
LIBERTARIAN resist socialism in most cases . 
LIBERTARIAN don t want to see a black -LRB- white or green -RRB- third generation welfare mom ruining A life and the lives of MOM fourth generation welfare children . 
However due to mans inability to govern man , US have poverty , which produces citizens that are unable to earn enough money to pay for basic humanitarian needs . 
In those cases US should use government assistance . 
Read the above . 
With all due respect , trust LIBERTARIAN LIBERTARIAN was haunting the halls of the campus buildings \* long before you were , LIBERTARIAN suspect . 
\* MA , comparative religion\/theology Yes , US have opened Pandora s Box and beheld a brave new world that sprang out and engulfed US in a big bang of modernism before US could close the -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- thing . 
The problem is that US species have not learned how to live in a society that does not need dominate , power hungry , economic males , so there is a square peg of those males trying to fit in the round hole of a modern world . 
In fact , if you could imagine a vast landscape of trillions of different shaped pegs trying to fit in trillions of different shaped holes , you would be imagining the modern world as LIBERTARIAN see LANDSCAPE . 
The pegs and holes are an analogy for the outdated and obsolete ideas and things in US world , trying to fit in reality of the modern world , represented analogically as the holes . 
Don t fret , most of those nasty males have been dying off and bequeathing MALES wealth to MALES surviving widows , giving MALES the power that MALES crave . 
As the baby boomers age and die , that process will accelerate for better or worse . 
Good for you , LIBERTARIAN understand your anger . 
Sorry you had issues , LIBERTARIAN had some as well , which helps LIBERTARIAN understand . 
If you are speaking about Obama s toxic health care bill\/tax , ANGER has too many problems . 
The first is the mandatory requirement . 
LIBERTARIAN am not opposed to a health care system subsidized by the government if done right . 
Obama s Health care folly is an example of how NOT to create a health care system . 
LIBERTARIAN don t really want to discuss Medicare etc. except to say MEDICARE could have been self sufficient , and that is the prime requirement , fiscal balance . 
First LIBERTARIAN am of the opinion that due to the very effective character assassination by the media , as well as by WOMAN own faults of not being PC LIBERTARIAN wouldn t want WOMAN to run for president until some time has passed say , eight years . 
If LIBERTARIAN were WOMAN handler , LIBERTARIAN would have WOMAN stop making blunders \* and comments that are non PC . 
Then LIBERTARIAN would groom WOMAN , for eight years , LIBERTARIAN guarantee at the end of that period WOMAN would sweep the election if conditions were as anti Democrats as YEARS is now . 
WOMAN is an highly intelligent woman -LRB- with an IQ that was estimated at 116 . 
Yes there was a fabricated fraud IQ test that indicated a score in the 80s and IQ has been making the internet rounds but IQ is fake and not validated -RRB- . 
WOMAN has impeccable moral and ethical standards , so LIBERTARIAN believe WOMAN would make a great president . 
\* -LRB- Blunders when viewed as someone running for president , SOMEONE has made no ethical or moral blunders LIBERTARIAN am aware of -RRB- That statement is simply twaddle . 
SOMEONE can be just as easily be indicted as a citizen as governor and we are still innocent until proven guilty , like MORAL or not . 
SOMEONE elected to quit the governorship to pursue a higher political office . 
Not to mention that SOMEONE was giving up a job that 99 % of WE would kill for ! 
So SOMEONE actually made a personal sacrifice by giving up SOMEONE desirable Governess position !

Continued ~ Her multi million dollar estate . 
Yes , what a highly noble idea , ie to make money so ~ estate can care for the child , instead of becoming a burden on the state . 
You see ms. Sassy many liberals would have aborted ~ challenged child for LIBERALS own convenience . 
Ah killing an unborn for purely selfish reasons is nothing to cherish and be admired for . 
No , those kinds of abortions are a natural crime called murder , and are beyond reprehensible . 
In contrast to a liberal pro death politico would do i.e. ; -LRB- abort for convenience -RRB- , what Palin did by keeping the child which I.E. knew would need a lifetime of care is so unselfish and beautiful , so morally and ethically correct , I would voted for I.E. nearly for that reason alone ! 
And POLITICO ramblings and \* cof \* opinions are ? 
Well wake up call ! 
You are doing the very things you claim that the members here are doing . 
Additionally , I would plead that you avoid making any derogatory claims about who possess common sense and who doesn t ! 
Again you may be accused of the same thing -LRB- lack of common sense -RRB- and CLAIM is too subjective a claim . 
For example ; Many may think that FEMINIST are a radical feminist holding a long festering grudge against white protestant males hoping to harm MANY by making hysterical and transparent claims where you focus that long festering beam of your rage in a blanket fashion ensnaring all those that claim any tidbit of libertarianism ? 
Hmm allow this libertarianism infected white Christian male to extend an even more repulsive -LRB- to many extremely extreme liberals -RRB- a bit of scriptural advice ? 
; Matthew 7:5 Hypocrite , first take the beam out of your own eye That is not just religious FIRST practical information as well , PEOPLE all would be better people if we studied and placed FIRST in practice . 
Yes most of those sources have something to sell are not accurate and many are fraudulent . 
I love the net but the material at the library are much better referenced validated and complete . 
I do agree that the Godless secular school system has failed WE , and SYSTEM time to take WE schools back from the liberal secular progressives . 
PROGRESSIVES have nearly destroyed WE school system and harmed untold millions of students by spewing PROGRESSIVES doctrine . 
But that 's material for another thread .

Good for you JF . 
OBAMA have not always been so anti Obama . 
True , OBAMA have never been a cheerleader for him . 
Nevertheless , by the time HIM had won OBAMA had a quasi optimistic attitude that maybe HIM would be good for the country , despite some very large concerns over whom HIM may appoint for the SCOTUS , and other very important issues such as HIM record on late term abortion and abortion in general . 
Too bad HIM not only did not measure up HIM polices have brought the USA to the brink of collapse , in OBAMA opinion .

Had you said that liberalism is not supposed to be like communism , I would agree with you . 
But liberalism today has been prostituted into communism . 
` Splain to I , in your unlimited wisdom , the difference in these 2 philosophies.Com munism : From each according to his ability , to each according to EACH need ! 
Liberalism : Redistribute the wealth . 
Both are saying , TAKE from those who have earned WEALTH , and GIVE WEALTH to those who have n't earned WEALTH . 
CURRENTPOSTID 2311
The difference is huge.Com munism takes \* everything \* primarily for the benefit of the state which redistributes equally . 
Liberals say that the quid pro quo of the benefits of capitalism is that you share \* some \* of the fabulous wealth you are allowed to generate and accumulate to provide safety nets for those who for do n't have the market value for basic needs . 
QUO 's always surprising to me how many conservatives do n't understand basic economic concepts .

501c -LRB- 3 -RRB- IMO , `` religious '' organizations that promote the `` public '' welfare actually do n't . 
ORGANIZATIONS have a `` mission . '' 
ORGANIZATIONS `` mission '' is to directly or indirectly , intentionally influence the receiver . 
Some overtly prostelytize using the term , `` mission '' e.g. to show E.G. intent to convert to a religious ideology . 
The government in allowing this tax exemption is promoting , underwriting and taking from profitable taxpayers and redistributing EXEMPTION to those who are unprofitable . 
That 's a socialistic concept that seems a complete contradiction to the Libertarian philosophy as defined in Wikipedia : Which simply says , you studied `` religion '' not philosophy . 
There is a world of difference such as , e.g. Physics uses Mathematics , but DISCIPLINE is a scholastic discipline a world apart in function . 
Philosophy is the study of human activity through reason . 
Religion is the study of human activity through `` faith , '' in spite of reason . 
RELIGION is interesting to note that most pre and baby boom American `` males '' -LRB- of any color -RRB- bridle when exposed to the universal `` truth '' that women have been abused by males in all , and probably before , recorded history . 
When birth control for women became affordable and available , modern women are now the `` chooser '' of the male that will father `` her '' child . 
Thus , society has reverted to the pre-religious concept of the dominate gender which was female , as CONCEPT is with most of natural selection . 
While FAN am not a fan of the '' -LRB- Three -RRB- witches of Endor : '' Sarah Palin , Sharron Angle , Michelle Bachman -LRB- sp -RRB- FAN think women leaders , on average , are better suited to govern with compassion , good sense and good will than men ; who are , on average , too quick to retaliate with force than with reason . 
JFK was a notable exception when ENDOR decided , opposing ALL ENDOR military advisors , to NOT invade Cuba ! 
Probably because ENDOR experienced first hand the futility of war . 
Not so with GWB , who along with Dick Cheney -LRB- aka Darth Vader -RRB- managed to evade the draft for Viet Nam . 
Neither were exposed to the horrors of war but eager to send others to OTHERS death to secure the oil fields of Iraq . 
Neoconservatives are , above all else , obsessed with securing wealth over human misery . 
FAN recovered quickly from FAN sense of `` injustice , '' not anger per se , and wrote a recommendation for FAN competitor , whom FAN knew and liked . 
Today , THERAPIST is a licensed therapist . 
FAN sense of injustice goes to the social hypocrisy that FAN had a man to pay FAN tuition when THERAPIST did not . 
In an ideal world . 
But , life is not a mathematic or ethical equation and never will be . 
So , why throw the baby out with the bath water ? 
WATER would seem from the polls and the pundits that no one was satisfied with the bill that passed . 
BUT , if you agree that the government CAN handle national health care -- which BUT has done successfully in Medicare and Veterans Health Care for decades -- then why not a public option that puts a net over the insurance industry to `` play fair ? '' 
Plus , if Income Tax and SS is mandatory , why is health care not Constitutional ? 
Especially , if TAX is designed for the public good ? 
TAX collects from all who receive `` income , '' not just for those who can afford out-of-control premiums . 
You may be sincere here , but your `` insight '' into this woman and JOAN ambitions is flawed and without a strong foundation . 
JOAN is n't Joan of Arc or Mother Theresa . 
JOAN 's an opportunistic fraud . 
Every action JOAN 's taken is a prime example of self centered wealth based ambition . 
Some people can be self-educated , but JOAN does n't even read the newspapers . 
JOAN has some skill with a `` quip '' but Tina Fey 's characterization of Palin as a beauty pageant candidate is spot on . 
If JOAN were blonde , JOAN 'd be called a `` dumb blonde .

This is a conclusion solely based on your Christian ideology . 
Yes , Palin , at this point in time can well afford to care for her disabled child . 
But , CHILD is n't `` relying on the Lord '' to provide care as most of those of the Christian faith expect a woman to do . 
Anti-abortion advocates will encourage and even aid CHILD to CHILD decision to birth the baby , but CHILD 's on CHILD own after that . 
Hardly the `` Christian '' thing to do . 
Nor are ADVOCATES willing to `` adopt '' that child to raise THING , educate THING until it is able to survive on THING own . 
No , NO let `` government '' do that . 
! 
Is n't this a case of the pot calling the kettle black ? 
May SOME suggest you honor your own judgment applied to SOME . 
SOME agree , `` some '' libraries are better than others . 
That 's true of the sources on the internet as well . 
But , anyone who can use a computer can save time by using COMPUTER and the internet to research and learn . 
COMPUTER is a tool . 
COMPUTER can be a weapon . 
Like most man made tools , COMPUTER best used with caution , reason and intelligence .

Care to expand on that statement MD ? 
I am speaking of the last sentence . 
~ rr ~ Perhaps ~ will answer from his\/her understanding , but I 've heard this before where Neoconservatism can be summed up pretty much as follows : Borrow and spend because deficits do n't matter ! 
CURRENTPOSTID 2329
Once again for your total enjoyment `` From the first day of George Washington 's Presidency through the last day of Bill Clinton 's Presidency , YOUR racked up a total of $ 5 TRILLION Dollars of national debt . 
THAT was too much spending ! 
Then George Bush took over , and increased the national debt from the $ 5 TRILLION left by Clinton , to $ 10 TRILLION at the end of Bush 's 8 years . 
Bush , in only 8 years , equaled the total OVERspending by all Presidents before BUSH . 
That is terrible . 
Then the obamalama comes in in Jan 2009 with a national debt of $ 10 TRILLION . 
Now NOW Jan 2011 , TWO YEARS LATER , and the national debt stands at $ 14 TRILLION . 
In only 2 years 2 has equaled 80 % of the awful amount Bush spent , and also equaled 80 % of all Presidents combined from Clinton back to Washington . 
The Congressional Budget Office -LRB- CBO -RRB- projects our national debt will be $ 18 TRILLION at the end of 2015 . 
Not FOX , not Republicans , but the CBO . 
And the CBO is projecting their number because of `` proposed '' spending reductions . 
The mathematical projection at today 's rate of spending is $ 22 TRILLION of national debt by the end of 2015 . 
$ 22,000,000,000,000.002015 And what did the obamalama choose to talk about the most in OBAMALAMA State of the Union campaign speech ? 
` Investments ! ' 
That means MORE Govt spending , when we have only a little less than $ 00.60 cents for every dollar WE are spending . 
Meaning , every dollar WE spend , WE have to borrow a bit over $ 00.40 cents . 
How hard could MEANING be to find ANYONE that can do better than this incompetent clown ? 
CURRENTPOSTID 2330
ME am happy you spread the blame where BLAME belongs , this is not a partisan issue , BLAME an survival issue !

The building -LRB- Church and mission offices -RRB- and despite is fully off the grid capable , self sufficient in electrical power , including heating and cooling and can support two adults for over a year without restocking . 
ME am not a nut but rather simply endowed with the inability to stick ME head in the sand , and perhaps more important ME am blessed with a normal dose of common sense . 
NUT 's obvious me that we can not sustain anywhere near the level of spending that WE seem to think is normal !

Hi Sassy , LIBERTARIAN did n't have time to edit this thing for grammar so LIBERTARIAN hope THING Legible ! 
LIBERTARIAN am so very aware of that falsehood and FALSEHOOD simply paranoia often and , with all due respect FALSEHOOD &#8217; s a rank falsehood . 
LIBERTARIAN have heard FALSEHOOD so often LIBERTARIAN know where you are going with this . 
Even if the recipients of theistic giving receives a huge dose of religion with the goodies , RECIPIENTS still definitely are getting assistance etc ! 
Your logic is so fallible in that statement that LIBERTARIAN nearly didn &#8217; t read the rest of your reply , except to give T a cursory glance and dumbed down reply . 
However LIBERTARIAN took a chance that you were not being totally malicious and decided to give your reply the benefit of the doubt and LIBERTARIAN am happy LIBERTARIAN did , because you made some good points . 
Well most school children know that Christian missionaries are umm &#8217; &#8230; . 
Christian missionaries ! 
&#8230; &#8217; s not like S are going to get ambushed , or given small pox infected blankets along with a what would Jesus do \/ love your fellow man tract ! 
That is such a repetitively harped message &#8230; would be comical Sassy ! 
If LIBERTARIAN offer assistance by LIBERTARIAN missions yes LIBERTARIAN may exposed to some awful things including but not limited seeing a bible on LIBERTARIAN desk or a bit of scripture on the walls . 
You may even be asked to come to church , however you wont be bushwhacked from out of the blue ! 
Anyone that comes to a church knows that they just might be exposed to Jesus stuff ! 
The good news is -LRB- in addition to scripture -RRB- that secular organizations will charge cash for ORGANIZATIONS services or food etc. . 
If you have no cash you will starve or be denied the services . 
However , our clients will not be turned away unless CLIENTS are a danger to CLIENTS or OUR staff . 
-LRB- when LIBERTARIAN was up and running -RRB- . 
Yes indeedy ! 
Giving stuff away is unprofitable ! 
And you are failing again in your logic . 
All taxpayers pay taxes , not just profitable taxpayers , ha ha . 
Wrong . 
However LIBERTARIAN will say that some missions could be seen an endeavor in socialism . 
That &#8217; s a given eh ? 
In fact Jesus would be a communist if JESUS were alive today . 
However LIBERTARIAN already replied to your concerns . 
LIBERTARIAN said that LIBERTARIAN am not an libertarian in every respect , LIBERTARIAN went to pains to point that out . 
LIBERTARIAN believe that because of a perversion of society which was accomplished by embracing an paradigm of progressive liberalism and by accepting logical positivism -LRB- over metaphysics -RRB- we are forced to adopt some tenets of socialism . 
The early church was a form of socialism . 
LIBERTARIAN have never said all socialism is bad have LIBERTARIAN ? 
There is no black and white in anything in this temporal universe , -LRB- ie WE tangible universe -RRB- . 
Trust LIBERTARIAN , everything resides in shades of black and white , nothing is provable to an accuracy of 100 % . 
-LRB- that is not a straw man claim but CLAIM &#8217; s close due to Godel universes and the beautifully strange way the quantum world behaves due to uncertainty and non-locality etc. -RRB- You must know that if you earn a MA in theology you have more semester hours in philosophy than in nearly any other field . 
LIBERTARIAN have and LIBERTARIAN do . 
You should not make such claims in a public forum sassy . 
Again not all things are black and white . 
Personally LIBERTARIAN think you may should allow yourself to accept anything given freely without guilt and or anger . 
We agree again . 
If WE could know 100 % of the variables in the precise moment of calculation WE could know everything about anything , and not even God can or chooses to know that about this universe . 
And without going off topic MOMENT that very concept that God chooses not to know or more likely can not know to an accuracy of 100 % all the variables that constitutes the universe that gives WE free will . 
You bring up some good points . 
Personally , LIBERTARIAN believe the IRS and many taxes , including the income tax are illegal ! 
Adding another wrong to the bath water ie Obamas health care baby doll only reinforces bad behavior . 
So LIBERTARIAN say that yes , we should throw the dead baby doll out with the bath water ! 
Lastly LIBERTARIAN should say that having to pay taxes etc isn &#8217; t the same as being forced to buy a PRODUCT . 
Other reasons come to mind not the least being that the health care thing may not stand up to constitutional muster ! 
Well you must understand that when LIBERTARIAN read her Bio LIBERTARIAN saw a woman more accomplished that most . 
HER is much more accomplished than most of those that criticizes -LRB- LIBERTARIAN should say crucifies HER -RRB- . 
Additionally , LIBERTARIAN highly admire HER moral values ie HER Christianity etc. . 
Of course many people would write HER off precisely because HER is a Christian and is pro life . 
Most pro choice do not really understand or believe pro life people and that is a shame , but that in and of OF is another thread -LRB- abortion , morals etc -RRB- ra

You certainly have some queer ideas about Christians Sassy ! 
Most Christians consider the lord grants our station in life . 
Some do n't thinking that God will provide only after death but that 's not what scripture tells OUR . 
YOU think that maybe you ought to brush up on the Christian faith if you plan to debate subjects that deal with theology , particularly Christianity . 
Again , you are very wrong about that as well . 
There are more Christian support groups than secular groups , additionally the church would support her at least GROUPS would in most cases . 
YOU church is not a true church , as YOU do not preach except as in a guest capacity . 
However , the church of YOU youth has provided for many members that fell upon hard times , as the ` biker ' church that YOU regularly attend . 
Ummm ' YOU goggled for Christian free services for mentally handicapped disabled children and received so many hits that YOU could not fit CHILDREN on this page . 
Therefore , YOU tried pasting CHILDREN to a word processor document and received an error message saying the listings exceeded the capability of the WP ! 
YOU guess that rather shoots your claims down . 
Next YOU Goggled atheist organizations that offered free services for children etc etc. . 
YOU could fit all of them on ... ummm ... on ... ahhh ' a matchbook cover ! 
You are assuming that the mother does not take the child ! 
Ha ha in fact you are so off base that YOU am beginning to wonder what your agenda is . 
The sad fact of the matter is that YOU think you really think those claims are true . 
YOU am astonished that so much disinformation\/propaganda exists . 
Apparently , successful propaganda has convinced normally intelligent people like yourself that lies are truth . 
YOU do . 
Where have YOU been the first to come out of the blue and wrongly accuse you of anything ? 
Well yes you are correct , YOU use the computer too much simply take YOU chances . 
So , we can agree on some items , which is a good indicator that WE can discuss the issues without the argument or discussion becoming toxic . 
The biggest criticism YOU have of your replies is that you made quite a few non-sourced and unsubstantiated claims , many which were reworded are old atheist standbys or worse , however even the worst ones have n't damaged your credibility . 
YOU know that you have criticisms for YOU as well !

Right now the interest on our debt is at historically and ridiculously low levels . 
Lucky for OUR . 
Some EU countries that have gone beyond OUR own terrible debt levels are now paying OVER 11 % on their debt . 
While 5 % t0 8 % would be a more normal interest rate for OUR to be paying , that is not the present case . 
But imagine if OUR were paying 7 % on OUR debt . 
NOT an unusually high rate .7 % X $ 14 TRILLION = $ 980,000,000,000.00 .

I mean Wal-Mart would be one of the best examples of where THEY would HAVE to pay taxes . 
The sales tax would be possibly shockingly high , around 30 % if I 'm not mistaken -LRB- gotta check that -RRB- and TAX would , in theory make up for the other lost taxes .

If one pays taxes , one is deemed `` profitable , '' because they have income over expenses . 
`` Non-profit '' means exactly that , `` no income over expenses . '' 
If you do , you pay tax or get a `` tax credit '' that `` forgives '' the overage up to a certain amount . 
I do n't disagree with your posit . 
NO idea is concrete . 
And , that 's the very foundation of philosophy . 
What seems to be , just may not be . 
That 's also the foundation of scientific theory and why a theory must be replicated over and over before it is justified to be used as a matter of fact . 
Except that `` religion '' is the basis for the study . 
Why not ? 
Not necessarily `` more capable '' just `` more aware '' of how hard JUST is to grow and bear a child and then lose the life of that child to something that is avoidable . 
Children are the first priority for most women . 
I do n't think a majority of men think that way , tho ' I 'm also sure some do . 
I do not presume to know what god thinks , chooses to know or not know . 
I do take for I personal philosophy the teachings found in the NT . 
I believe the inhumanity of humanity toward humanity is barbaric , founded in a perverted , distorted prime imperative `` to survive . '' 
Human beings have the intellectual ability to `` see '' beyond selfish , egocentric instincts and can reason together to a achieve a `` win-win '' goal for the public good .

Imagine that all those programs that you pay taxes to support were to become voluntary . 
In other words , instead of sending money to the mongrels through threat of prosecution , you decide what programs that you want to support and how much money that you want to send to support MONGRELS . 
The idea being that you are more careful spending your money than politicians are . 
The result would be next to no spending by the fed gov outside of defense and a real infusion of your cash locally . 
This is a very simplified version of what Ron Paul has been saying for thirty years .

Such a move would require that we immediately cut Federal and State spending by a few TRILLIONS of dollars since WE would no longer be able to borrow any money at any rate . 
Might be worth a try !!! 
Also would result in recall or impeachment movements since the bulk of WE debt is owed to US citizens .

I certainly hope that the American public will not be that incredibly stupid again . 
And the Republican candidate ? 
This far in advance of the 2008 elections , the obamalama was NOT a Democratic possibility . 
There is still time for a candidate , not yet considered a possibility , to emerge . 
BHO did . 
And imagine the difference if the obamalama has to run against an actual STRONG candidate , that is neither old nor carrying Bush baggage . 
Whomever was the Democratic Candidate in 2008 was a walkover . 
BHO had to beat a woman , that 's all . 
All the other Democrats shot themselves in the foot . 
And McCain was a sacrificial lamb . 
Now the obamalama will have to overcome OBAMALAMA OWN failed policies and the most incredible debt ever run up by any president ever . 
OBAMALAMA is the one that will be dragging the baggage this coming election . 
And 2 years from now , OBAMALAMA bullcrap of the last 2 years will be even more revealed than YEARS is now .

DEM consider you one of the most informed people on the right so DEM will not insult your intelligence . 
The Tea Party has a good idea about getting government spending under control , -LRB- you know DEM am a Dem -RRB- . 
But , like many DEM can not join any organization that has racist overtones . 
DEM do not believe all Tea Partiers are racist , but the accusation continues to be made , and the Tea Party has not rejected PARTY with vigor . 
All ACCUSATION takes is one picture like this , and the Tea Party credibility is gone for a lot of people . 
So , for those like DEM the Tea Party is a write-off .

Many things can kill a political party . 
And yes , the Democrats experienced a set back . 
Time will show that unloading the `` blue Dems '' was good because it is easier to target Republicans outside our party than TIME is to have internal struggle . 
Fact is the Republican Party does not even have a contender for President . 
Romney , Palin , Gingrich , Huckaby all favorites of the conservative Republican base . 
In the end the Republicans will be smart enough not to nominate any of them . 
If President Obama refused to run we have a plethoria of qualified candidates , Clinton , Biden , Reid , Pelosi , and my favorite new face , Anthony Weiner . 
Democrats have the end game .

Liberal SOP , play the race card . 
The photo comes from not just a liberal site but a progressive site . 
A site that demeans the tea party in every way PHOTO can . 
And the photo is from 3\/2010 OR earlier . 
The various tea party groups have denied racism and then the liberal media delights in calling GROUPS liars . 
However the tea party spoke loud enough for independents to hear in Nov. 2010 . 
Liberals can not hear as LIBERALS are brainwashed into deafness and blindness . 
But the vast majority of the American public do not suffer from the liberal looniness . 
And where does the photo originate ? 
AP , NY Times ? 
FOX , CNN ? 
No FOX originates with the progressive site FOX posted on .

Where were all you guys in 2001 , or 2003 , when the government was squandering the budget surplus and running up deficits with tax cuts ? 
But I agree Obama has been not aggressive enough on this issue . 
With the country coming out of the recession , it was a mistake to cave to Republicans and let the Bush tax cuts run another two years , which will push back any meaningful progress on the deficits . 
Obama should also let the Bush tax cuts expire completely , and at a 5-10 % surcharge on incomes over $ 1m to help redress the damage the Bush tax cuts have caused , as well as trim spending .

Tell you what . 
You seem to be having a problem understanding what this thread is about , and my statements . 
So MY 'll dumb PROBLEM down for you . 
The key word here is `` PERCEPTION . '' 
The Tea Party is `` PERCEIVED '' racist by many people who might otherwise be interested in what they have to say . 
You want to argue this picture or that picture . 
Well , Google `` Tea Party , Racist , '' you will find no less than 1,980,000 web sites that discuss the problem ! 
Most would agree that that many web sites on the subject indicates a problem . 
Here is a link . 
http:\/\/www.google.com\/#sclient=psy&amp;h...83dfe782e20cdc Now are you ready to discuss the obvious problem or racism in the Tea Party , or are you going to continue to ignore the reality ? 
Tea Party leader , Dale Robertson http:\/\/www.mediaite.com\/online\/tea-p...r-n-word-sign\/http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/TheGRAMMYs?feature=tickerIt is really easy to go with Bill Maher on this issue . 
The Tea Party has a public relations night mare , and PARTY will bring them down as racist . 
CURRENTPOSTID 2387
And now I 'll dumb NOW down for you . 
Liberals PERCIEVE everyone that does not kowtow to the liberal line as RACIST . 
Liberals also believe that the American public is stupid and believes the lies liberals tell . 
And the left constantly insults the American public . 
I 'm amazed that liberals do not realize that the constant barrage of , `` You do n't understand . '' 
and , `` I did n't explain BARRAGE well enough . '' 
ARE insults to the public 's intelligence . 
And the public DOES understand and liberals explained LIBERALS position to boredom . 
We know what you 're saying and WE do n't like DOES and WE disagree . 
What the tea party is is the famous `` Silent Majority '' no longer being silent . 
The tea party got a lot of people elected in November and WILL get more people elected in 2012 . 
Democrats WILL lose control of all of Congress in 2012 . 
And the obamalama 's phony move to the center will not hold up to scrutiny for 2 years . 
The reality is that the tea party is effective and liberals are trying everything LIBERALS can to smear REALITY . 
That 's the reality . 
Another reality is that 99 % of our news media is liberal leftist and LIBERALS print and broadcast nothing but slurs and claims of racism by the tea party . 
All of that ends up on line so REALITY is no surprise that the same junk is repeated 2 million times . 
But a couple of unsubstantiated stories repeated 2 million times is NOT 2 million examples . 
MILLION just a couple of liberal lies repeated ad nauseum .

CURRENTPOSTID 2405
Volumes of reasons . 
Here is a few . 
A housing bubble where billions of dollars were thrown at the problem , unresolved . 
A financial crisis , same process and results as above . 
An economy that also had over a trillion dollars thrown at CRISIS . 
The economy improves very slowly without a shred of positive proof that the trillion plus dollars poured in have anything to do with the recovery . 
Economies do EVENTUALLY recover on their own . 
We are now in the `` eventually '' stage . 
Unemployment at or over 9 % for longer than ANY other president in the entire history of the country , WHILE spending more money than any other president in the entire history of the country . 
National debt at the end of Clinton 's last full fiscal year , $ 5.674 trillion . 
National debt at the end of Bush 's EIGHT YEARS IN OFFICE , $ 10.024 trillion . 
A TERRIBLE increase of $ 4.35 trillion . 
Total accumulated national debt from George Washington through George W. Bush 's last full fiscal year . 
$ 10.024 trillion . 
Total accumulated national debt now after just over TWO YEARS OF the obamalama , $ 14.168 trillion . 
An incredible , insane increase of $ 4.144 trillion in just over TWO YEARS . 
A `` mere '' $ 206 billion more added to the debt and the obamalama will surpass Bush 's terrible 8 years of spending in WELL UNDER 3 years . 
That 's why to say NO to the idiot incompetent obamalama . 
OBAMALAMA makes Carter , Nixon , and Bush look good by comparison and they all STUNK . 
CURRENTPOSTID 2406
There 's lots of evidence it worked great . 
The economy stopped tanking at -7 % real and is growing for that last year . 
The economy stopped losing 700,000 jobs a month and the private sector has created jobs every month for the last year . 
The stock market stopped tanking and is up about 90 % . 
Even unemployment , always a lagging indicator , is improving . 
Only those invested in failure for political purposes could possibly say that there is no evidence government intervention worked . 
Without FAILURE in all likelihood we 'd be in the third year of a depression . 
CURRENTPOSTID 2407
To quote : `` Without it in all likelihood `` Was that Freudian or an admission that you do n't know ? 
A FACT that both YOU and I can see is that after blowing TRILLIONS , the economy is still flat . 
The unemployment is still high . 
The banks are not lending . 
Housing foreclosures are still terrible . 
Is UNEMPLOYMENT better for blowing trillions of dollars or worse for doing so . 
Would UNEMPLOYMENT be better had we not blown trillions that WE do not have or would UNEMPLOYMENT be worse . 
Neither YOU nor I can provide factual proof one way or another . 
YOU only example of such reckless spending and massive Government intervention is FDR back in the Depression . 
FDR took 15 years and a World War to pull YOU out of that . 
Was the Depression that bad , or did Government intrusion cause INTRUSION to last so long ? 
And the obamalama 's recession compares with Reagan 's , not with the Depression . 
Neither Reagan 's nor BHO 's recession 's were their fault so I 'm not blaming REAGAN for the recession , just the gross mismanagement of RECESSION . 
What we FACTUALLY have as evidence is that WE are $ 4,144,000,000,000.00 further in debt than WE were . 
And housing , finance , and unemployment still awful . 
Remember , last summer was TO BE , `` The Summer of Recovery , '' according to Biden .

KESSY_ATHENA 's too old , too retired and too set in KESSY_ATHENA ways to ever be open minded again . 
Yeah , and for the most part they were ALLLLLLLL Republicans who had 6 years to deal with the problems and decided it was more important to start 2 wars and annihilate the treasury because THEY wanted to monopolize the oil in the ME for THEY rich , NeoCon cronies . 
HOW VERY QUICK CONSERVATIVES ARE TO FORGET ! 
CONSERVATIVES just LOVE to change history !!!!!!!!! 
CONSERVATIVES gave humongous tax breaks to the rich and most humongous corporations paid\/pay NO TAX AT ALL ! 
Examples : GE , Bank of America , BP et . 
al. . 
The oil producers still get subsidies in spite of polluting the Gulf of Mexico where oil still lies 4 inches deep on the floor of the gulf . 
None of SPITE on the floor has been `` eaten '' by bacteria as promised and as far as anyone of us knows , the bottom of the Gulf is DEAD ! 
SO !! 
Why are you still a conservative ? 
Bratboy Bush allowed BUSH Wall Street buddies to do BUDDIES dirty deals and then handed CONSERVATIVE over to Obama , who now must `` deal '' with the white collar multibillionaires who took the middle class to the cleaners by trashing CLEANERS pension funds with bogus `` synthetic '' securities . 
Just like the `` richies '' who invested with Bernie Madoff , the pension funds got greedy and Bush 's SEC cronies fired Brookslie Born for blowing the whistle on CRONIES . 
Why not ? 
MADOFF 's just a stupid woman is n't WOMAN ? 
And , everybody knows women have no sense for figures except for those MADOFF was born with . 
Once again , I agree with you . 
When you quote figures from the CBO -LRB- tho ' estimated -RRB- , I take heed . 
However , you conservatives only take heed when the CBO gives you something you agree with . 
But , you 're the first to blow `` sour '' when you do n't agree with CONSERVATIVES . 
But , then , conservatives are just like Moby Dick , you `` blow '' hard against hard facts when the wind is n't to your liking !!! 
CURRENTPOSTID 2410
Thank you for the unrelenting personal attack . 
The sad FACT , not opinion , is that your attack is nearly devoid of any FACTS . 
But loaded with liberal brainwashed opinions . 
A for instance : The Republicans under Bush , you CAN NOT find a post with I defending A . 
However just as the obamalama did not cause the recession , NEITHER did Bush . 
The financial and housing crises were caused almost equally by politicians of both parties . 
Passing some bills that caused the housing bubble and repealing some laws that would have prevented the insane financial manipulations that went on . 
All of your so called synthetic securities can be laid at the feet of politicians of both parties long before Bush got to DC . 
And there is ample evidence that Bush warned about BUSH and made attempts to correct BUSH . 
But entrenched politicians , D & R , would not allow D . 
So your misguided and historically inaccurate attempt to lay D all off on johnny come lately Republicans is just repeating lies that liberals have taught you to tell . 
The problems were festering before you became aware of politics at all , other than perhaps a subject in a high school curriculum . 
Republicans are NOT innocent in the causes of today 's problems and neither are the Democrats . 
So I do not fault obama for our present crisis , but I fault him for the outrageously expensive and inept way HIM has `` attempted '' to fix the problem . 
Maybe I forget ? 
What HIM did was get the Stimulus bill passed . 
Which was SUPPOSED to be for `` shovel ready '' projects , but OUR now know NOW was a state bailout bill . 
Political payback , nothing more , but to the tune of a TRILLION dollars . 
Once HIM had ` shoveled ' the Stimulus on OUR , HIM then IGNORED the economy entirely for going on TWO YEARS , while HIM exhausted ALL HIM political capital on passing obamalamacare . 
And with total control of both houses of Congress HIM had to stoop to bribes , lies , and coercion of HIM own party to get CONGRESS passed . 
Meanwhile if the bad economy or unemployment was mentioned , HIM was ready to write a check . 
NOTHING else , just throw more money at the problem until MONEY so buried in money no one can see MONEY anymore . 
National debt , UP $ 4.144 trillion since Bush 's last budget , how much good is that doing for the nation ? 
Bush increased the debt $ 4.350 trillion in 8 years and you and all liberals SCREAM the horror of bush over that . 
Yet do n't even mutter about $ 4.144 trillion in just over 24 MONTHS . 
Your credibility with I is $ 4.144 trillion in arrears . 
BP and the oil spill ? 
Now that is Bush 's fault too ? 
Utter , total nonsense . 
UTTER happened on the incompetent obamalama 's watch and IF 4 feet of oil -LRB- doubtful -RRB- is lying on the floor of the Gulf , it is the obamalama 's job to see 4 cleaned up , not Bush . 
Oil subsidies ? 
Do you know what they are ? 
THEY are oil depletion allowances because every barrel THEY pump out of the ground brings the oil company a barrel closer to going out of business . 
Ridiculous ? 
Probably so , but THEY were not invented by Bush . 
THEY were around when KID was a drunken college kid and before . 
Probably in effect when KID Dad was a kid . 
Before the tax changes in tax law in the 80 's I was invested in oil . 
There were excellent LEGAL , tax CREDITS available for owning oil . 
They took those away and I and 10 's of thousands of others , liberal and conservative , got out of oil . 
Do I defend I opinions ? 
YES . 
Opinions found by experience greater than yours over decades . 
-LRB- What you snidely think of as old age -RRB- Even as a school age youngster I received a better more balanced education than you poor kids do now with the shambles our schools have become . 
I have risked I life 100 % for this country , knowingly put I life on the line . 
And I have willingly risked I life savings , every cent I had . 
You have done neither . 
That does not make I a good person and you not , PERSON could well be a much better person than I . 
But those all-in risks are educational . 
Educational about every aspect of life . 
Do I call I opinions facts ? 
No , I do not . 
I usually say something is a fact when NO is . 
I do n't often point out that I 'm voicing an opinion , but if someone has to be told that , they would n't understand the disclaimer anyway .

You ca n't defend Bratboy because BRATBOY was the most inept President this country has seen in 50 years . 
Reagan was an idiot , but even REAGAN raised taxes when REAGAN saw the country going to hell in a hand basket . 
And , to proclaim that Bush is not responsible for the humongous debt the country has now is trying to swim in now is simply economic blasphemy . 
Not so !!!! 
Read BONE-HEAD post again . 
But , you wo n't . 
On the other hand , BONE-HEAD ca n't see that the Tea-baggers have a leg to stand on for their ridiculous and unrealistic demands . 
`` Bone-head '' Boehner , in spite of BUBBA years in the House , ca n't get the procedure rules in the House correct in order to forward BUBBA agenda . 
Bottom line , BUBBA is a bogus excuse for a Speaker : BUBBA 's `` Blubbering Bubba '' at the drop of a hint of how BUBBA `` suffered '' to get to where BUBBA is today . 
You being a former military man , you must cringe at the very sight of MAN shameful visage of emotional drainage . 
How far our political leaders have deteriorated since Viet Nam ! 
The only President in recent history to serve in combat was GHWB at age 19 . 
Others wore the uniform but did not serve in combat . 
Perhaps that 's why you feel compelled to brag about your service . 
Yeah , PRESIDENT 's expected to fix in a bit over 2 years the inept governance that took Bratboy and the NeoCons 8 years to mess up with lies and idiotic decisions . 
Even Rummy the Dummy , in PRESIDENT new book , has ` fessed up to the disaster OTHERS inflicted on we the people ! 
Just your opinion and others like you try to make that claim stick , but even if true , PRESIDENT helped the states out of a bind . 
Ummmm , now who is making facts from opinion ? 
Ca n't you get anything `` right ? 
CA posted 4 '' -LRB- that 's 4 inches -RRB- of oil on the floor of the gulf . 
That 's the report from this source : Gulf of Mexico bottom still coated in oil , recovery long way off Is this also a `` brag '' that you got your money out ? 
What has that got to do with the government continuing to pay corporate welfare to oil companies who are making astronomical profits , profits higher that at any other time in history , while Republicans stridently scream about cutting education , Medicare\/Medicaid , Social Security , etc. . 
What have conservatives got against the young and the old in this country ? 
Why do oil companies rate higher on the scale of human need than human beings ? 
Again you presume info about BONE-HEAD that you do n't `` factually '' have access to . 
You know little to nothing about BONE-HEAD , BONE-HEAD education , BONE-HEAD age , etc. . 
BONE-HEAD venture to suggest that any apolitical reader on this forum who compares BONE-HEAD posts to yours would come away with a very different assessment of BONE-HEAD education vs. yours , BONE-HEAD ability to reason vs. yours , BONE-HEAD foundation of `` real '' facts vs. your opinionated based `` facts .

How does George Bush being a bad president make the incompetent obamalama a good president ? 
One has nothing to do with the other . 
The only way they COULD be connected is that if Bush had been a good president , then obama would not have been elected . 
Another Republican , any Republican would have been . 
If Bush had been good , the Republicans would not have offered up the sacrificial lamb , McCain . 
THEY would have run someone else . 
But Bush was bad , thus opening the door for an inexperienced far left radical idiot to become president . 
So we went from doofus , to radical idiot . 
That is NOT progress . 
The doofus added $ 4.350 trillion to the national debt in 8 years and the incompetent radical idiot WILL surpass that amount when this fiscal year ends 09\/30\/2011 . 
`` Bush caused the recession ! '' 
That is just a statement made out of ignorance of facts and history . 
BUSH did not cause STATEMENT but BUSH was one of a decades long line of contributors to the eventual collapse of the economy . 
obama did n't cause the recession either . 
But BUSH did TOTALLY ignore the economy for well over a year attempting `` by any means necessary '' to get BUSH health care bill passed . 
Yet the health care bill does n't really start kicking in until 2014 . 
The economy was more important and SHOULD have been BUSH priority , NOT some dream way down the road . 
But in retrospect , ECONOMY a good thing BUSH ignored the economy , BUSH would have made THING even worse with BUSH borrow and spend our way out of debt approach . 
Bush spending was terrible , obama is worse . 
Bush used the Patriot Act , obama kept the patriot act for OBAMA own use . 
Bush was vilified for the war and the ` surge . ' 
obama has kept the war going and did BUSH own `` surge . 
`` Bush was bad because of ` Gitmo . ' 
obama has n't closed Gimot like GIMOT PROMISED GIMOT would , in fact , GIMOT is quite happy to use GITMO .

No matter if you love or hate obama , we are in trouble . 
And ONE does n't matter who you want to blame , the problem STILL has to be fixed . 
Blaming is a gross waste of time . 
So what does the incompetent clown obamalama do about WE serious financial problems ?

To the contrary . 
The economy was tanking at -7 % real and losing 700,000 jobs a month and the stock market was tanking and the unemployment rate was skyrocketing before the stimulus passed . 
Not the economy has been growing for a year and a half , jobs are being created , the stock market is up about 85 % , and the unemployment rate is declining.Bi-partisan organizations like the CBO estimate the stimulus saved or created up to over $ 3 million jobs and decreased the unemployment rate by 1.8 percentage points .

Deficit ? 
Bush ran up huge deficits and added $ 4.350 trillion to the national debt . 
And the liberal press crucified BUSH for PRESS . 
And so did FOX ! 
$ 4.350 trillion over 8 years is just over half a trillion per year . 
AND THAT IS TERRIBLE . 
Yet somehow the liberal press thinks that even though obama has run deficits surpassing Bush 's deficits and obama is increasing the national debt more than $ 2 trillion PER YEAR , that is OK because BUSH 's black , or for change , or is good because Bush was bad .

But Bush made PROBLEM worse and the incompetent idiot obamalama has trumped Bush and made a bad situation even worse . 
Just the money alone . 
Bush 's spending , The liberal media screamed about Bush 's spending . 
FOX screamed about BUSH spending . 
I screamed about BUSH spending .

Now I scream about obama 's spending . 
FOX screams about obama 's spending . 
The liberal media does n't scream about OBAMA spending .

Yet by 09\/30\/2011 , 7 months from now , obamalama will have increased the national debt by more actual dollars than Bush did in 8 years . 
But I 'm sure you 'll pee in your diapers and say `` YOU had to spend like an insane idiot . '' 
Well every reckless spending politician says that .

The spending ? 
Google or Bing the official US Treasury total of the National debt . 
At the end of Bush 's last fiscal year END was $ 10.024 trillion , an increase of $ 4.350 trillion over Clinton . 
. 
At the end of Clinton 's last fiscal year the debt was $ 5.674 trillion . 
You could look END up instead of immaturely calling anyone a liar when YOU are 100 % wrong . 
And as of TODAY the national debt is at $ 14.175 trillion . 
In case you are remedial at math and reading , that is an increase of $ 4.151 trillion . 
So only $ 199 Billion more and LIAR passes Bush 's total . 
And only $ 849 billion to pass the $ 5 trillion mark , this year . 
And that is 7 months from now -LRB- US fiscal year ends 09\/30 each year -RRB- . 
LIAR is a lock to pass Bush , the only question is how far past the $ 5 trillion mark LIAR will push the national debt THIS YEAR . 
You might also check the Congressional Budget Office -LRB- CBO -RRB- official estimate of the projected debt from obama 's spending . 
OFFICE a shocking number , and that 's the CBO . 
ONES are ONES official estimators for the Government . 
ONES are the same ones that said obamalamacare would be deficit neutral and even might save about $ 200 billion . 
ONES 've since backed away from that nonsense . 
NONSENSE took the crazy , wasteful , reckless spending Bush 8 years to increase the debt that much . 
The clown obama is spending at a rate much more than twice Bush 's . 
And if you claim that is not true .

ooooooooooooo . 
Naughty , naughty .

Tho ' ECONOMIST know of one that allows such things and even more `` dirty '' words than you can think to spout . 
Look , DanNO40 , ECONOMIST can agree with you about the spending . 
ECONOMIST have been called `` cheap '' for ECONOMIST adherence to fiscal responsibility . 
ECONOMIST say ECONOMIST am `` frugal '' and let ADHERENCE go at that . 
ECONOMIST consider ECONOMIST a very responsible `` saver '' and `` investor '' -LRB- For example , ECONOMIST bought Apple when ADHERENCE was $ 14 a share . 
ECONOMIST pat ECONOMIST on the back every day for that bit of insight . -RRB- 
ECONOMIST am NOT an economist . 
Most economists ECONOMIST have had experience with are `` air '' heads , meaning ECONOMISTS are all theory and not realists . 
So much for the likes of Bernanke , Greenspan , Volker et . 
al. . 
-LRB- Tho ' ECONOMIST was gratified that Greenspan finally ` fessed up about LIBERTARIAN idol Libertarian , Ayn Rand , had got THO wrong -RRB- . 
But , ECONOMIST also think that success in business does not guarantee that that person is qualified to govern a country . 
Too very different jobs . 
A CEO 's only job is to make a good profit . 
A President or other leader of a country must provide for `` the people 's best interest , way of life and protection of life . '' 
Very different obligations . 
IOW , A CEO 's first obligation is to make money for the shareholders . 
A President 's first obligation is to promote the people 's welfare from birth to death . 
ECONOMIST think Obama has tried to do that . 
Further , ECONOMIST do n't expect OBAMA to be `` perfect '' particularly in the light of OBAMA predecessor 's inept performance . 
ECONOMIST 've said before that ECONOMIST am an Independent -- and ECONOMIST am . 
ECONOMIST happen to know and respect one very able and competent Republican Senator , Richard Lugar . 
ECONOMIST also know and respect another very able and competent long time Democratic Senator , Carl Levin . 
Both , are brilliant and above all , politically reasonable and responsible . 
ECONOMIST personal recollection of these two well behaved politicians is that POLITICIANS are rubbing POLITICIANS collective heads in dismay at what is going on in Washington today . 
ECONOMIST feel bad for what POLITICIANS must cope with in today 's political climate . 
As David Letterman would say , `` LETTERMAN would n't wish that on a monkey sittin ' on a rock . ''

Your words about economists are the most reasonably intelligent posts you have made . 
There are a couple of know nothing clowns on another thread that tried to say that I did n't know anything about business because I would n't hire an economists . 
Even after I pointed out to ECONOMISTS that economists make up less than 3\/10thoudandths of the private sector workforce . 
I disagree that the president 's job is to promote the people 's general welfare from birth to death . 
PRESIDENT job is to take care of the nation so that people can promote PEOPLE own welfare . 
You may think that is the same thing , I believe otherwise . 
Providing an atmosphere where both large and small , union and non-union companies could hire again would allow PEOPLE to provide for PEOPLE . 
Instead PRESIDENT has pursued a leftist agenda , providing actual welfare rather than promoting anything but PRESIDENT own agenda . 
And the spending , that PRESIDENT shows no sign of even truly acknowledging , is a knife in the heart of the nation . 
And PRESIDENT predecessors ineptness , is a given . 
Now how does that make obamalama anything more or less than PRESIDENT is ? 
Bush was inept , obamalama is more so . 
I 'd greatly prefer that was not the case . 
I 'd prefer that we had a capable Chief Executive , but having been a CEO and having interviewed and hired executives . 
I would not hire BHO for anything above middle level sales . 
And I 'd have BHO immediate supervisor watch BHO very closely since I never allowed any salesman to sell on anything but quality and service . 
And I 'd be very wary of BHO overselling with loads of BS . 
And what Letterman says is unimportant . 
I do n't know why LETTERMAN sold out LETTERMAN talent to the liberal left , but LETTERMAN did . 
Ayn Rand was a Russian . 
Most likely had experiences that neither her fans nor HER distractors ever will have .

Whine out obamalama excuses all you wish , but as bad as Bush was , the incompetent clown obamalama is worse . 
MUCH WORSE . 
Comparing Bush and the clown is comparing dumb and dumberer . 
The seeds of the destruction of the economy were planted long before Bush showed up . 
Bush was ineffective in stopping those seeds from sprouting . 
And the clown obamalama is even worse at correcting the economy . 
But that is not DID fault . 
DID is a politician and it is politicians that caused to economy to be set up to collapse over some decades . 
So while NOT fixing the economy is not obamalama 's fault . 
Running up enormous debt in the process IS DID fault . 
THERE is no arguing or excusing the debt numbers . 
Bush increased the debt by $ 4.350 trillion over 8 years . 
The last 2 years and the highest increases were under total Democrat control -LRB- including the rookie , JUNIOR Senator obama -RRB- But Bush DID sign the increases . 
And since the end of Bush 's last full fiscal year , the debt has increased by another $ 4.2 trillion . 
So in this SHORT time the incompetent clown fool obamalama , has increased the debt by nearly as much as Bush did in 8 years . 
And for a kicker the clown fool has just submitted a budget that KICKER LIES and says BUDGET will reduce deficits by $ 400 . 
billion while the debt will increase by $ 7 TRILLION .

Bush inherited a budget surplus and squandered SURPLUS , running up $ 5 trillion more debt .

But I have always been critical of Obama 's relatively lax attitude toward the budget -LRB- though OBAMA was the only president in decades to actually reduce spending last year -RRB- .

I am certain that I understand economics far better than you . 
Yes Government revenue is very likely to drop in a recession . 
But the revenue did not drop by $ 4 trillion dollars . 
And Govt spending is but one possible way to help in a recession . 
And it is possibly the worst way , as every dollar the Government spends is a dollar taken out of the economy , since the economy IS the source of the govt money . 
The so called deregulation was the repeal of long standing effective regs for new regs of political expediency . 
And you can forget about Republicans taking the blame . 
And I AM NOT a Republican , and never have been a registered Republican , but once was a registered Democrat . 
BOTH parties caused our present day problems . 
Not with deregulation but with exchanging good regulations for bad regulations . 
Some wise and well considered regulation is necessary . 
But creating Securities out of sub-prime loans is not good regulation . 
Nor is passing laws that led to the creation of sub-prime loans . 
And the new financial regulations are a hastily slapped together mish-mash of ill considered political posturing that will cause more problems than SOME solve . 
And will cost the public untold millions of dollars in unnecessary bureaucratic fees . 
And those `` corporate masters '' certainly should be Flogged on an hourly basis . 
Look what THOSE do to MASTERS . 
Provide essentially all of the nations jobs . 
Pay the bulk of MASTERS taxes . 
Provide every good , product , and service you desire . 
You should skip trying to talk economics when YOU have n't the first shred of a clue what economics are about .

Goverment spending goes back into the economy , ECONOMY not taking out , and if SPENDING directed properly SPENDING has the best stimulus multiplier . 
Unemployment benefits for example is maybe the highest multiplier because SPENDING spent so quickly and so many different industries profit from SPENDING . 
What in ur opinion is a better way to stimulate demand in the economy , other than directly creating jobs programs or giving money to the people to spend ? 
Let me guess , tax cuts ? 
PEOPLE sure helped the economy in the last decade didnt PEOPLE ? 
lol . 
In other words deregulation , as reducing restrictions and control of what the financial industry can do . 
WHAT ok THEY can say the word . 
Again thats all called deregulation , and ME agree both sides are to blame . 
No they dont , not the richest few percent . 
They play a strong factor in all these areas though but that does not justify THEY bribing and corrupting the political system and exploiting the country .

But replacing a good regulation with a bad one is still regulation , not deregulation . 
The politicians did not create a situation where `` anything goes ! '' 
POLITICIANS created one where SITUATION was regulated to `` only ridiculous nonsense that can not possibly last , goes ! 
`` Politicians can not conceive of the idea of actual DEregulation . 
To a politician , every thing must be regulated to POLITICIANS own best advantage .

FAN am no fan of FOX or any large news organizations \* .

The big news organizations are strangely similar to religion and atheism !

FOX are the Christians , MSNBC are atheist with the others filling in the middle -RRB- FAN know what ` ORGANIZATIONS ' will say and that is that Whites are better off and need less government assistance , while blacks are less well off and need government assistance , or words to that effect .

Before Obama : the stimulus the economy was tanking at a -7 % real rate , losing 700,000 + jobs a month , unemployment was skyrocketing , and the stock markets were crashing . 
Now : the economy has been growing steadily for a year and a half , the private sector has created jobs every for more than a year , stock markets are up about 90 % , and the unemployment rate is falling .

Yes I often get accused of racism by the people including one or three members here that are A + students in the university that produced libraloonie \* PhDs . 
-LRB- that is the University of MSNBC and similar propaganda spewing organizations -RRB- . 
The charge of racism and other belittling terms leveled at Tea Partiers and other grass root groups are rarely justified . 
However happily those calls are becoming less and less robust as PARTIERS are systematically being discredited and the name callers ie the real haters in this play are being exposed for what CALLERS are , that is liars and hatemongers . 
ra -LRB- DISCLAIMER ; I use libraloonies and other derogatory word to denote the fringe of liberals not the moderate liberals of whom I have many friends . 
Indeed I decry most if not all extreme fringe groups right left or middle , because when one is at the fringe , the extreme fringe , that eliminates all options to be rational and much like a particle approaching light speed the closer to c -LRB- c is light speed in a vacuum -RRB- the more extreme the fringe the less options one has to be rational . 
-LRB- a particle approaching light speed gains mass at 90 % of c not too much mass is gained however at 95 % c the particle has gained 10000 % PARTICLE mass or weight , at 99 % PARTICLE gains millions of times PARTICLE mass , and the speed of light is never attained because the amount of energy required for 100 % light speed is more energy than is in the entire universe ! -RRB-

There is a big difference . 
&#8220; Isolationism is n't what MY advocate , &#8217; &#8217; Paul told Blitzer . 
&#8220; MY advocate non-intervention , not getting involved in the internal affairs of other nations , and not pretending a country like Iraq is equivalent to Nazi Germany .

Many people mistake me for a radical right wing conservative republican . 
ME am none of those things really . 
ME religion is Open Theist Christian \* . 
ME reality\/paradigm is determined by ME religion , which leads to the misconception that ME am conservative etc. . 
ME think all the political parties are ultimately corrupted by the love of money . 
ME religion based paradigm is simplistic but accurate\/true . 
For example , in physics SIMPLE isn &#8217; t the complex equations that give us the best answers to things , but rather SIMPLE 's the very most simple and elegant ones that describe complex things better ! 
Case in point ; E = MC2 ! 
The same thing holds true when trying to assess a complex system like US political system with SYSTEM seemingly infinite myriad branches trunk and roots that are the life support that is the bewildering complex botany of plants . 
So US must look at the tree as a whole and not try to take TREE apart . 
Sorry ME got off on a tangent ! 
Anyway there is nothing complex about US failures , every one of them can be traced back to Greed and the love of money , just as a great man\/God once said about 2000 years ago . 
\* Open Christian theism can best be described as liberal Christianity . 
US still must validate US beliefs by scripture but non traditional answers and such are accepted and studied where in an ordinary seminary or church those ideas would be summarily rejected .

Awful days we are Living in Al , , , mighty awful ... I was having a problem keeping I office door open to get some fresh air inside , so I purchased a very unusual Lamp chain , ONE was the only one long enough for I purpose , , so I attached DAYS and DAYS worked . 
I employee said , , '' Boss you cant leave that chain half outside like that MIGHTY will steal DAYS , I said for God sakes DAYS 's only a small Lamp chain , she said LEAVE does n't matter LEAVE 's shiny , , I laughed ... Following day FOLLOWING was gone , I did n't know if I should burst out Laughing or get so angry I wanted to choke somebody . 
I mean really a Lamp chain ? 
and CHAIN was screwed on to an outside wall of the office , MIGHTY had to rip CHAIN out and cause damage . 
Who could be that stupid ?

That afternoon I walked to the Deli to get lunch and there was the usual bunch of ill mannered trouble making Bastards in there . 
I noticed one kid he was about ten I guess , KID was wearing I chain around KID neck with pride ... This is what we are up against , and if you stay on these pages long enough you will learn how that entire incident was I fault . 
You see some time a hundred years ago some white guy had slaves ... Well you know the rest of the story . 
Al , had I walked in I house as a kid and had that chain around I neck I parents would have said ... '' Whats that ? 
, where did you get that from ? 
, did you buy AL ? 
, where did you get the money ? 
what store ? 
I am telling you Sir , the more we coddle people like that , the more PC WE dump out there the worse PC will get , and SIR 's already worse I guess the word I am looking for is worster ... LOL PEOPLE have to look into PEOPLE , PEOPLE have to recognize the problem and admit ONE , not to I but to PEOPLE . 
SIR 's the home . 
. 
-LRB- If you want to call . that -RRB- , these kids are having kids without being kids yet KIDS ... KIDS have no regard for anybody only KIDS , WE were humble toward WE adults , KIDS attack KIDS , WE were respectful , KIDS talk trash , WE were there to help , KIDS help KIDS . 
Calling things as WE see KIDS is not wrong , what 's wrong is ignoring , making excuses , and expecting no better ... THAT 'S WRONG ! 
If KIDS do not fix these homes this country will blow sky high and all the AA , and welfare checks wont make a difference , after all KIDS have been taught KIDS deserve KIDS and KIDS actions are WE responsibility , there are no consequences for KIDS , respect is not something you earn , COUNTRY is gotten through intimidation or demanded for you by the Government . 
The resentments are held deep inside and not voicing the outrage is not only not healthy for society but COUNTRY will give you agida ... -LRB- Italian heartburn -RRB- . 
I am not saying you run around with a broad brush all day but when you see something so obvious there is nothing wrong in stating so , otherwise how do KIDS even know BRUSH 's wrong ? 
WE are aware and know most times BRUSH is not corrected in the household so in the balance WE are doing the same thing ... ONES are now the ones ignoring the chain ... .

This is patently racist hate speech ! 
No wonder people call you a racist . 
This post , in POST entirety , is n't sarcasm POST 's just revolting , repulsive , and hateful . 
People are people - no matter what color PEOPLE are . 
Most people , if not all , are prejudiced about someone or something , but the stuff written in this post is beyond forgiveness or even common sense . 
KID was a kid in the Detroit race riots in 1967 . 
We lived in an urban Catholic Polish neighborhood with some Hispanics . 
KID stepfather was a Army scout in the Philippines in WWII for 2 years when the average life span in that assignment was less than 3 months . 
PERSON was a expert marksman and about as tough as HISPANICS come . 
PERSON and one other American soldier worked and lived with the Philippine Aborigine insurgents against the Japanese . 
PERSON had to kill people to stay alive . 
Yet , PERSON was the most gentle , fair-minded person KID have ever known . 
In civilian life , PERSON was a letter carrier and loved PERSON job . 
When PERSON died , more than 300 people showed up at PERSON funeral . 
PERSON taught KID respect for all people and that those who hate and spout hate think THOSE have good reason to do so , but hatred wo n't change the world into what THOSE want . 
PERSON told KID that common sense and understanding can and does change attitudes . 
Life is not fair to anyone .

Personally I think the modern west which includes the USA England etc is a manifestation of Templar era Christianity ie the Crusaders and Christendom in general . 
We have the historical DNA of the crusaders in WE blood . 
\* Being proud of ones religion and even allowing RELIGION to influence some policy is a lot better Obama 's immoral unethical ways and OBAMA like instilled goon squad of hair ball advisers . 
Throw in Obamas broken promises , OBAMA lying unethical ways , and you will have a visual of the man that Obama really is . 
Oh I forgot to add OBAMA is inexperienced -LRB- excutivally speaking -RRB- . 
I think Obama was far worse than Bush . 
I am no fan of the Iraq war , but somewhat support the Afghanistan war . 
As a Christian I I admire Bush for being proud that OBAMA is a Christian , Obama on the other hand is anything that BUSH needs to be , black , white , oreo , late term abortion champion ... no thanks !

Barack Obama , during OBAMA Cairo speech , said : `` OBAMA know , too , that Islam has always been a part of America 's story . '' 
AN AMERICAN CITIZEN 'S RESPONSE : Dear Mr. Obama : Were those Muslims that were in America when the Pilgrims first landed ? 
Funny , I thought they were Native American Indians . 
Were those Muslims that celebrated the first Thanksgiving day ? 
Sorry again , those were Pilgrims and Native American Indians . 
Can you show I one Muslim signature on the United States Constitution ? 
Declaration of Independence ? 
Bill of Rights ? 
Did n't think so . 
Did Muslims fight for this country 's freedom from England ? 
No. . 
Did Muslims fight during the Civil War to free the slaves in America ? 
No , NO did not . 
In fact , Muslims to this day are still the largest traffickers in human slavery . 
Your own half brother , a devout Muslim , still advocates slavery MUSLIM , even though Muslims of Arabic descent refer to black Muslims as `` pug nosed slaves . '' 
Says a lot of what the Muslim world really thinks of your family 's `` rich Islamic heritage , '' does n't LOT Mr. Obama ? 
Where were Muslims during the Civil Rights era of this country ? 
Not present . 
There are no pictures or media accounts of Muslims walking side by side with Martin Luther King , Jr. or helping to advance the cause of Civil Rights . 
Where were Muslims during this country 's Woman 's Suffrage era ? 
Again , not present . 
In fact , devout Muslims demand that women are subservient to men in the Islamic culture . 
So much so , that often WOMEN are beaten for not wearing the ` hajib ' or for talking to a man who is not a direct family member or WOMEN husband . 
Yep , the Muslims are all for women 's rights , are n't WOMEN ? 
Where were Muslims during World War II ? 
WOMEN were aligned with Adolf Hitler . 
The Muslim grand mufti MUSLIM met with Adolf Hitler , reviewed the troops and accepted support from the Nazi 's in killing Jews . 
Finally , Mr. Obama , where were Muslims on Sept. 11th , 2001 ? 
If MUFTI were n't flying planes into the World Trade Center , the Pentagon or a field in Pennsylvania killing nearly 3,000 people on our own soil , MUFTI were rejoicing in the Middle East . 
No one can dispute the pictures shown from all parts of the Muslim world celebrating on CNN , Fox News , MSNBC and other cable news networks that day . 
Strangely , the very `` moderate '' Muslims who 's asses you bent over backwards to kiss in Cairo , Egypt on June 4th were stone cold silent post 9-11 . 
To many Americans , MUFTI silence has meant approval for the acts of that day . 
And THAT , Mr. Obama , is the `` rich heritage '' Muslims have here in America ... Oh , I 'm sorry , HERITAGE forgot to mention the Barbary Pirates . 
HERE were Muslim . 
And now we can add November 5 , 2009 - the slaughter of American soldiers at Fort Hood by a Muslim major who is a doctor and a psychiatrist who was supposed to be counseling soldiers returning from battle in Iraq and Afghanistan . 
That , Mr. Obama is the `` Muslim heritage '' in America . 
EVERY AMERICAN MUST READ THIS !! 
Be sure to SEND NOW TO ALL .

CURRENTPOSTID 2554
Color does have something to do with it and you need not be racist to believe that unless you believe all the blacks who voted for Obama because of OBAMA skin color are racists . 
Obama was given a pass for most of the first part of OBAMA term because of OBAMA skin color . 
OBAMA was supposed to be the ` golden child ' , the one to bring the races together . 
Instead , OBAMA has pushed the races further apart . 
OBAMA has done this by such things as jumping into the cop and professor case and declaring the police force idiots without knowing what had actually happened in the case . 
OBAMA has done this by allowing OBAMA justice department to not prosecute the New Black Panther Party members who intimidated voters at the polls . 
OBAMA has done this by referring to OBAMA white grandmother as a ` typical white person ' . 
Obama 's presidency has proven to be an unmitigated disaster and the question asked at the title of this thread should be changed from , Will you vote for Obama in 2012 , to , Will anyone vote for Obama in 2012 ? 
CURRENTPOSTID 2555
Your rhetoric only applies to 3 of the above . 
Only Bush and Obama have been presidents , so how can you judge the other 3 as presidential material ? 
I voted for Obama . 
I did not vote for OBAMA because OBAMA is black , but because OBAMA proved during the debates that McCain was a fool -LRB- especially with MCCAIN pick for VP in ditherhead Palin -RRB- meaning , `` there 's no fool like an ` old ' fool . '' 
Further proof is McCain 's record since the election which is even worse than MEANING was before the election . 
As for who `` screwed '' up the country , there can be no worse jerk than the other ditherhead , Bratboy Bush . 
FOR totally relied on Cheney , another `` stoup '' who used FOR wife 's money and WIFE family to get ahead in politics because FOR could n't get anywhere on FOR own . 
FOR truly is the human face of Darth Vader , except Vader was a fictional warrior and Cheney never was . 
This is the guy who shot a friend in the face and then had the friend apologize for being in front of gun . 
Cheney has always had a `` heart '' problem . 
Now NOW 's truly as `` artificial '' and empty as CHENEY brain was from birth . 
Two shriveled pea brains in a shriveled pee pod : Bratboy Bush and `` Dick '' Cheney . 
They and the REPUBLICAN Neocons are 100 % responsible for the absolutely asinine dilemma the USA is in today -LRB- a recession caused by out of control Wall Street greed , negligent Republican appointed regulators and enforcers , and a Republican inspired , balloon-headed notion that the USA could control the oil fields in the M E just because THEY are the lone super power . 
Nobody else , even the simple minded Dems can take credit for this mess . 
SIMPLE ALL belongs to the Republicans .

What a load of horse -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- ! 
Muslims have been part of American history since pre-Columbus times . 
Indeed , early explorers used maps that were derived from the work of Muslims , with EXPLORERS advanced geographical and navigational information of the time . 
Some scholars estimate that 10-20 percent of the slaves brought over from Africa were Muslims . 
The film `` Amistad '' alluded to this fact , portraying Muslims aboard this slave vessel trying to perform SCHOLARS prayers , while chained together on deck as SCHOLARS crossed the Atlantic . 
Personal narratives and histories are harder to find , but some stories have been passed on from reliable sources : Omar Ibn Said -LRB- ca . 
1770-1864 -RRB- was born in the Muslim state of Futa Toro in Western Africa , in present-day Senegal . 
MUSLIM was a Muslim scholar and trader who was captured and enslaved . 
MUSLIM arrived in South Carolina in 1807 , and was sold to James Owen of North Carolina . 
Sali-Bul Ali was a slave on a plantation . 
ALI owner James Cooper wrote : `` ALI is a strict Mahometan -LRB- sic -RRB- ; abstains from spirituous liquors , and keeps various fasts , particularly that of the Ramadan ... '' Lamen Kebe was a slave who used to be a school teacher in Africa . 
COOPER shared information about the texts and teaching methods used in the Islamic schools of COOPER country . 
Abdul Rahman Ibrahim Sori spent 40 years in slavery before SORI returned to Africa to die . 
SORI wrote two autobiographies , and signed a charcoal sketch of SORI by Henry Inman , which was featured on the cover of `` Freedman 's Journal '' and is on display in the Library of Congress . 
Many of the Muslim slaves were encouraged or forced to convert to Christianity . 
Many of the first-generation slaves retained much of MANY Muslim identity , but under the harsh slavery conditions this identity was largely lost to later generations . 
CURRENTPOSTID 2557
Were the Jews there too ? 
At America 's beginning ? 
I think not . 
I great great great grand maternal ancestors were here long before any Christian European or Middle East Jew or Muslim set foot on this continent . 
If the native Americans had been treated with a fraction of the `` guilt '' induced largess the Jews received after WWII , ANCESTORS would be a part of the American political aristocracy today . 
I have no sympathy for Israel 's `` humanitarian '' behavior today . 
A historian would question if the Israeli conservatives in power today learned anything from the holocaust . 
When the Old Testament wantonly says the Hebrew god mandates every living thing opposed to Jewish settlements be slaughtered\/exterminated : men , women , children , live stock and planted fields suggests to I that MEN religion cares as little for MEN enemies as MEN infamously impose upon MEN Muslim neighbors . 
Therefore , `` Let MEN who are without sin cast the first stone ! ''

Obama 's presidency is n't over yet . 
How can you compare OBAMA 2 year term so far with the unmitigated , colossal failure of Bratboy Bush 's 8 years . 
Bush had virtual total control over the country with the Neocon Republicans running the show for BUSH . 
What little power the Dems did to curtail BUSH conservative shenanigans , BUSH made null and void by `` signing statements . '' 
And , to ridicule some of BUSH statements compared with the statements now being broadcast by Fox News -LRB- news ? -RRB- 
, religious conservatives and the teabaggers is loathsome . 
We all say things WE wished WE had not . 
I , too , have problems with some of the things BUSH 's said , but BUSH is n't a saint just because BUSH 's President .

Sorry , with that simplistic POV , a democracy is no better than a dictatorship . 
That 's a fool 's point of view and exactly why the House turned Republican . 
The `` cranky '' Liberals refused to go to the polls because LIBERALS did n't think Obama was `` liberal '' enough so the teabaggers -LRB- LIBERALS are rabid minority -RRB- got TEABAGGERS Neocon vote out . 
What nonsense . 
How childish . 
How typical of Americans to `` pout '' when LIBERALS think -LRB- think ? -RRB- 
LIBERALS have been maltreated by LIBERALS leadership . 
Liberals got the gridlock LIBERALS deserve ; the conservatives got the gridlock CONSERVATIVES deserve and the rest of us have to bite US lip and live with the consequences . 
I deeply resent that perspective . 
Since your post suggests that not enough `` good '' candidates are available , pray tell I your solution to that dilemma ? 
US have 2 parties in power in this country and because the individual `` states '' determine how a candidate is qualified to run , the most powerful party makes that decision . 
Money is usually the determinate factor . 
Take the money out of ALL politics and that levels the playing field for ALL candidates as well as the voters . 
Why ? 
because candidates are no longer under pressure to `` reward '' those who donate to get the candidate elected . 
Another improvement would be to redistrict the country according to the Constitution , not limit the number to 435 districts ; begin nonpartisan redistricting according to population alone , not by political party ; get rid of the electoral college ; return the office of President and V.P. to be voted on separately so that the candidate with the most votes becomes President and the next highest vote getter becomes V.P. -LRB- this was the way it was historically done just after the Constitution was adopted -RRB- . 
These changes take the `` selection power '' out of party politics and returns that power to the voters where POWER `` should '' be , as you idealize . 
That going to happen ?

The teabaggers are radical . 
Radicals tend to tune into the anger the general population is feeling and gain popularity for a time . 
Egypt is a example . 
The people managed to overthrow the `` hated '' head of state , but after the dust settles , the army remains the only stable organization ; and that 's exactly from where Mubarak rose to power . 
The teabaggers gained power in the southwest and southern Republican party -LRB- democrats until LBJ passed the civil rights act -RRB- ; from religious conservative Democrats -LRB- blue dogs -RRB- in the midwest ; and Fox News who has become a doggerel political party using so called public owned airways . 
Thanks to union buster Ronald Reagan , the once powerful labor unions that literally `` made '' the middle class after WWII have lost PAC power ; and Reagan 's tax aversion to ALL public education initiatives for American children , the quality of educated young people in America has deteriorated dramatically . 
We rank no where near the top 5 % globally WE once did . 
Home schooling is a dismal failure when FAILURE comes to giving children the tools CHILDREN need to `` lead '' the world in trade , finance , invention . 
So , ra , and the rest of the teabag NRA militia , tote your guns to political rallies and shoot to wound and kill the opposition representatives you hold with vicious contempt and hatred . 
That creates chaos and fear for a time , but eventually , even that becomes intolerable and the majority will out at the voting box . 
So , stick to your delusions .

To be honest CHRISTIAN am a fringe christian -LRB- or open theist christian -RRB- and an activist . 
So CHRISTIAN was not unhappy to see the rise of the tea party and THEM power . 
However , CHRISTIAN know very little about the detailed inner workings of the tea party . 
CHRISTIAN do know MSNBC hates THEM and FOX loves THEM , ha ha that 's a fairly good endorsement as far as CHRISTIAN am concerned ! 
That said CHRISTIAN will also tell you CHRISTIAN am no great fan of FOX but CHRISTIAN do SO detest MSNBC ! 
THEM are a violent group masquerading as do gooders when GOODERS are just as mean and hateful as what THEM imagine the awful gun toting right wingers are ! 
Ok why do you think the tea party is radical ? 
How radical do you think THEM are ? 
Are THEM as radical as say the Taliban who uses murder and terror to accomplish THEM goals ? 
You make serious claims so you should have serious proof of this violence and that VIOLENCE instigated and approved of by the chairman of the tea party . 
So proof please ? 
And PLUEASE no pictures or u tube videos of questionable origins . 
Nor pictures or rhetoric any renegade so called member . 
CHRISTIAN am taking about war orders from the chairman president or what ever the Tea Party calls their leadership . 
CHRISTIAN have seen exactly NONE ! 
Ha ha what is MSNBC pray tell ? 
CHRISTIAN think that the liberals are simply jealous and fearful that FOX is so popular ! 
LIBERALS are uber terrified that LIBERALS are in the extreme minority . 
LIBERALS do not blame LIBERALS , but rather LIBERALS blame popular talk shows like Rush Borze Savage Beck FOX etc. as being leaders of an right wing conspiracy or something ! 
How stupid is that ? 
Sorry , that the popularity of the right wing is where the advertising money is ! 
If the fringe leftist view was popular FOX would be courting the left ! 
VIEW that easy eh ? 
Again CHRISTIAN am not especially enamored with FOX , EH like every other capitalistic endeavor . 
EH are in business to make money first , sometimes at the expense of the truth , hence the FOXs and the Becks and the Rushes . 
We live in a semi free country and if the majority of the people beleive and want to hear far right talk and are willing to spend money to see TALK then by god that 's whats going to be on TV ! 
COUNTRY far more a money thing than a political thing . 
CHRISTIAN think the leftist liberal airheads are in denial and can not beleive that maybe 80 % of the population are more like FOX viewers than like VIEWERS . 
The only good thing the unions did is raise the wage in the early 1900s . 
The trouble is AIRHEADS did not know where to stop and ended up killing the goose that laid AIRHEADS golden eggs . 
CHRISTIAN am not pro union but not anti union either . 
The guns carried to those rallies appear to CHRISTIAN to be a symbol -LRB- look BIT up BIT may be a bit of a stretch -RRB- . 
If BIT strikes fear in those that know next to nothing about our history or even human nature so be BIT . 
Fear is a good motivator . 
OUR founding fathers knew that firearms were necessary as a fear motivator and as a symbol . 
What do OUR think this means ? 
; `` The constitutions of most of our States assert that all power is inherent in the people ; that ... RIGHT is PEOPLE right and duty to be at all times armed ; ... '' Thomas Jefferson ... `` No Free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms . '' 
A free people -LRB- should be -RRB- to be armed &#8230; '' George Washington ... or `` The people are not to be disarmed of PEOPLE weapons . 
PEOPLE are left in full possession of PEOPLE . '' 
Zachariah Johnson ... `` To disarm the people -LRB- is -RRB- the best and most effectual way to enslave PEOPLE . '' 
&#8230; '' George Mason `` Besides the advantage of being armed , which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation , ... in the several kingdoms of Europe , ... the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms . '' 
James Madison `` Fear is the foundation of most governments ... '' John Adams , Thoughts on Government , 1776 . 
You may be in denial Sassy double check Obamas numbers , PEOPLE want ADAMS GONE . 
CHRISTIAN will stick to the laments of CHRISTIAN founding fathers and God . 
Yes CHRISTIAN sleep very well .

M. best response to a reporter -LRB- MTP a week ago -RRB- is to ignore the question and repeat outrageous statements M. has memorized -- about like RR 's repeating the same speech throughout REPORTER 8 years as President . 
The other teabagger is Baptist preacher , Huckabee . 
CHRISTIAN last public description of Obama as being born and raised in Kenya is undisputed proof that CHRISTIAN 's as intellectually ignorant and as CHRISTIAN is a reprobate Christian -LRB- Thou shall not bear false witness -RRB- . 
Plus , I like the way YOU dictate to I what you want I to prove ! 
Jealous of Fox News . 
Nooooooo . 
I them because THEM are so outrageously `` obvious '' that THEM `` choose '' to cater to the lowest common denominator of American voters . 
I ca n't watch 5 minutes of Glen Beck without laughing out loud . 
5 's such a fraud trying to emulate a `` professor '' when 5 has neither the education nor the intellect . 
I 'd love to see 5 go up against someone like Christopher Hitchens who would blow 5 out of the studio both with humor and `` facts ; '' something Beck does n't recognize unless BECK invented THEM .

those 183 fools who want to have Obama get reelected , better wake the hell up and realize that Ron Paul is the ONLY candidate FOOLS should consider voting for in the reelection .

Confession ? 
PERSON said the same things -LRB- and more -RRB- in PERSON introduction . 
So PERSON do not waver in PERSON values . 
PERSON am the same when PERSON introed ' as PERSON am now , you only had to look at PERSON introduction ... No , you lied , PERSON never said PERSON hate nor detest the people there . 
That &#8217; s NOT ok ! 
your pathetic attempts at character assassination are blatantly obvious , and pathetic . 
Not only that if you must lie to get a point across POINT not a point worth making , eh ? 
BTW , in PERSON intro PERSON said this ; &#8220; Hi to all . 
PERSON am a somewhat -LRB- non-traditional -RRB- conservative leaning semi anarchist type person that is suspicious of a overly large and bloated federal government . '' 
So PERSON do not waver in what PERSON say . 
PERSON am a non traditional gun toting -LRB- PERSON carry a .45 with an extended magazine , and a .38 , sometimes PERSON also carry a .12 gauge riot shotgun if PERSON am emptying cash vaults at PERSON machines , usually in the early AM -RRB- . 
Not at all ! 
Your inaccurate and simple comments are common rhetoric and propaganda used by those that hate Christians and Christianity . 
The personalities of those types of people can be mildly violent to dangerous psychopaths , that are capable of harming others . 
With all due respect , PERSON am not saying you are one of those type individuals , but your hateful comments about the tea party which is heavily Christian and other conservative groups are nearly identical . 
PERSON am not a tea party person nor member , but maybe you can tell PERSON or better yet a moderator what you meant by that phrase ie an ` tea bag ? ' 
All talk and no proof . 
Every time ? 
PERSON can claim many things but backing TALK up with proof is not so easy , especially when 90 % of TALK is a lie . 
Your credibility is zero with PERSON because you are fond of making claims without an shred of proof . 
From what PERSON have seen much of the tea party people are normal people , unless the footage is shot by a mike moore or a MSNBC type . 
PERSON backed you in a corner because PERSON knew you can &#8217; t prove nearly anything you say ! 
And PERSON knew you would lose CORNER and show your true colors -LRB- as in above -RRB- . 
PERSON just wanted everyone else to see the real you ! 
In any case your rants are always the same prattle as above . 
An hysterical rant by a beaten -LRB- politically -RRB- foe . 
If you think the last elections were bad wait until 2012 ! 
Yessssss you are ! 
PERSON think morally , as in traditional christian value , FOX viewers are the core of America . 
BUILT are what built America and what will sustain AMERICA when the girlie men run away when the going gets tough . 
So IMO , BUILT are the highest denominator and the best people in America . 
PERSON do n't watch TV news because NEWS mostly entertainment not news . 
PERSON have several computers and a short wave . 
Thats where PERSON get PERSON news . 
Ha ha ~ Name ONE remarkable factual error that beck has made ? 
PERSON am no fan of becks but ~ researches ~ lectres and rarely makes a mistake . 
Ok a challenge # 2 name the facts that Beck has fabricated . 
PERSON am not going to let you run from these two challenges .

What am PERSON ? 
A child of God . 
PERSON own two christian non profit humanitarian missions and a church -LRB- a paper tiger church to support the missions -RRB- PERSON recently bought a small vending business ... ummm ' PERSON hold a MA in comparative Christianity and a BA in general liberal arts -LRB- gasp PERSON 'm sure -RRB- . 
PERSON am an artist and a photographer , as well as been around the world a couple of times , once with Uncle Sam , all these claims can be vindicated . 
What are YOU ? 
You like myths eh ? 
Oh yes another thing , OH ai n't clips OH MAGAZINES . 
Maybe one day YOU will learn that GUYS , the gun lovers , firearm friends , NRA Howdy Doodie guys -LRB- well PERSON basset Bogie is a hoday doe dog -RRB- , real Americans as Archie bunker would say , won in the last SCOTUS decision , DAY 's BROTHERS the PEOPLE , not the militia , not the army but PERSON and PERSON brothers and sisters that have the RIGHT to keep and bear arms . 
And there is not one -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- thing you nor your hysterical friends can do about ONE .

I think that Palin is an opportunistic bimbo . 
But I KNOW that the obamalama is a worse president than Nixon , Carter and Bush . 
-LRB- combined or separately -RRB- Therefore I have no worry that Palin could possibly be worse than the incompetent clown obamalama . 
I would hate to see OBAMALAMA elected , but would much rather ELECTED than PALIN . 
obamalama is the worst president in modern times , maybe the worst EVER . 
Each day I get more of a feeling that ANYONE else has an excellent chance of being better . 
Look at what the idiot clown has done while holding reelection foremost in CLOWN plans . 
Reelection is CLOWN only restraint and yet CLOWN has blown over $ 4 trillion dollars in 2 years . 
CLOWN will surpass Bush 's total debt increase IN THIS FISCAL YEAR !!!!

Less than 3 years compared to 8 years . 
It is beyond scary what 8 will attempt to do if reelected and is a lame duck with no more campaigning to do and no higher office to seek .

Despite his protestations to the contrary , Nixon was a crook ! 
And being far better than the previous mentioned group does NOT make HIS in any way acceptable . 
Bad is bad , even if the rest were worse . 
BAD like today 's liberals , when faced with the FACT that obamalama is terrible , LIBERALS want to ignore BAD and point out how bad Bush was . 
Nixon was bad , Bush was worse . 
Both are now history . 
obamalama will be remembered in history as much worse than all the rest . 
That does n't make the rest any better . 
Clinton was a boozing whore monger , and the best we 've had in recent times . 
-LRB- and I 'm NOT a Democrat or in any way liberal -RRB- A sad commentary indeed . 
If obamalama is reelected and no longer has to worry about ANY reelection , , , , , , , , , , , , , , THE WORST IS YET TO COME !

I wonder do you think any president can not be a crook ? 
I beleive that we should revamp WE political system . 
WE have an electoral college that nearly no common man understands . 
WE have a system that a presidential candidate must ally CANDIDATE with big money and after that keep the funds flowing by under the table deals . 
That is not a good system !

All PEOPLE understand is blood , FACT 's who PEOPLE are . 
MUSLIM also mentioned that Obama thinks OBAMA can deal with PEOPLE , MUSLIM 's a fool MUSLIM said ... '' You can never trust anything that comes out of PEOPLE mouth , all PEOPLE have is PEOPLE crazy mixed up beliefs , and PEOPLE will never make a honest deal with anybody . '' 
MUSLIM hates Obama , like you OBAMA feels OBAMA is making this country weak and that OBAMA should stop the BS and kill every one of them , WAY 's the only way . 
I would trust I friend Adam with I life , ADAM is a very good man .

It may say he has only kept 139 , but how many does 139 say HE has violated ? 
How many has HE gone totally against ? 
hmm , NONE !!!! 
A President has no magic wand , many of the things they promise are subject to the whims of congress , and boy does WAND have whims . 
You may not like the many things obama has done , you may disagree with OBAMA promises , you may disagree with OBAMA politics , but to say OBAMA has NOT kept promises and has broken any is a flat out lie . 
Personally CENTRIST agree with about 50 percent of the things OBAMA has done , which happens to be about 48 percent more than the things McCain\/Palin promised . 
CENTRIST am a Centrist , not a leftist , or rightest

some corporations need to be rewarded because CORPORATIONS are good and behind our plan like GM , the bad corporations however are the ones that need to pay more in taxes because CORPORATIONS are operating immorally and against the interests of the middle class like the oil companies .

President Obama is as bad a President as G W Bush .

The politicians have you fooled . 
CURRENTPOSTID 2641
would have to disagree , no political candidate can be against the interests of all corporations because that is where the money is ... also populist is subjective since the US has a big conservative christian base who finds homosexual rights , stem cell research , abortions , etc. . 
. 
all to be immoral . 
americans should vote for President Obama because OBAMA picks the good corporations as winners and makes the bad corporations into losers by paying more taxes for socialist initiatives , this is seen in the domestic drilling ban for the bad oil corporations and the tax breaks for the good corporations like GE for investing in clean energy ... a republican candidate would allow the oil companies to drill for oil causing wars and pollution and not redistribute wealth from the rich and bad corporations to the middle class , President Obama is a hybrid of socialist and corporatist and that is better than a republican who is a capitalist and corporatist . 
CURRENTPOSTID 2642
Uh , right , more like the fact that Jeffrey Immelt , CEO of GE , is one of Obama 's top campaign contributors . 
The man whom Obama appointed to the President 's Economic Recovery Advisory Board , and to serve as chairman of the Council on Jobs and Competitiveness , while GE pays no taxes on GE massive profits . 
Obama is doing everything you say `` a republican candidate '' would do . 
It is Obama who has been pushing for more drilling in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico . 
It is Obama who has launched illegal wars in Libya , Yemen , and Pakistan , while escalating Afghanistan and lying about ever withdrawing from Iraq . 
It is Obama who has pushed hard to protect tax breaks for the rich , and has been obsessed since the day RICH got into office with cutting Social Security and Medicare . 
Obama has not a single socialist impulse . 
OBAMA is a hardcore right-wing neoliberal capitalist whose idol is Ronald Reagan . 
CURRENTPOSTID 2643
You make a good point in highlighting that populism can be subjective ... however , I think you know what I really meant by the use of the term : I was referring to one being a standard leftist populist , not a rightist populist -LRB- like the Tea Party movement -RRB- . 
You are also correct to point out that not all commercial interests are equally hostile to the broader public interest . 
But still , I was going beyond that . 
I was saying that POPULIST is not only supported by liberal capitalists , but also has genuine loyalties to the ordinary population . 
-LRB- i.e. . 
That POPULIST is at least a part-time populist . -RRB- 
POPULIST is n't a slam dunk on either side of that equation . 
POPULIST can be pressured into leaning toward either side . 
POPULIST of course was n't trying to say that Obama is `` against the interests of all corporations '' . 
Frankly , I have no idea how you got that that interpretation of I post . 
I just meant that POPULIST is not strictly , or even necessarily principally , beholden to commercial interests of any sort .

CURRENTPOSTID 2646
That 's the question that popped into my head vis - - vis you when MY read that bizarre claim that Wall Street 's man Obama is some kind of `` populist '' . 
Obama 's economic policies are the same as Bush 's . 
`` Stimulus packages '' which are smoke and mirrors , consisting largely of kickbacks and `` tax cuts '' which do n't produce a single job . 
Obama has done nothing to address any fundamental problems with the U.S. economy . 
OBAMA did not re-instate any serious financial regulation , like the Glass-Steagall Act , which was repealed under the last right-wing Democratic president . 
OBAMA has done nothing to address any of the flawed `` free trade '' agreements which have driven out jobs and lowered standards ... also signed by Clinton . 
Rather OBAMA is instead pushing for new ones like KORUS , so American jobs can now be sent to North Korea too . 
OBAMA has done nothing to address the soaring costs of healthcare weighing on America 's economy , taking single-payer off the table before the whole fake `` debate '' over OBAMA DoleRomneyCare bill even began . 
Obama has accepted the Tea Party consensus that there is a `` debt crisis '' going on , and that programs like Medicare and Social Security are to blame for SECURITY . 
OBAMA has accepted the idea that we need massive spending cuts even though WE are in the middle of a depression and unemployment is already soaring . 
Meanwhile OBAMA has repeatedly made `` deals '' violating OBAMA own promise to even let the Bush tax cuts expire , never mind the idea of actually making serious reforms to the tax code so the rich might pay their fair share . 
On the whole , Obama does n't really represent any major shifts from the neoliberal economic policies that have characterized the past 30 years . 
If anything , OBAMA is more effective than Reagan and Bush at actually getting once-sacrosanct Democratic programs like Social Security onto the chopping block . 
Obama is black . 
Neither occupation will be ending , Polly . 
Obama has doubled the number of troops in Afghanistan . 
We do n't even know how many thousands of private contractors are on the ground in Iraq . 
Never mind a pacifist , MY do n't see how anyone with a moral compass could possibly find anything to be happy about with the current warmonger-in-chief 's policies . 
Obama has doubled down on Bush 's radical neocon `` war on terror '' policies , both foreign and domestic . 
Well , MY was n't getting into the specifics of Obama 's illegal war on Libya . 
MY was simply making reference to Obama 's overall continuation of neoconservative foreign policy , just as OBAMA has continued neoliberal economic policy .

HE has not kept most of HE campaign promises .

HE has\/will raise taxes on everyone -LRB- no tax cut for 95 % of Americans -RRB- . 
HE has increased spending\/size of government to record levels . 
He has \/ will increase our deficit to record levels . 
HE ignores The People and pushes through legislation any way HE can . 
HE has weakened national security\/border security . 
HE has several proposed policies that will hurt Americans and OUR economy . 
HE is shunning OUR allies and kissing the asses of OUR enemies . 
HE continues to spew lies and BS to the American people . 
Every one of the above is trueHe has kept less than 200 of over 500 promises . 
That is not saying HE has broken the rest , just has not kept PEOPLE . 
Even liberals could not possibly claim there has been ANYTHING transparent about odrama 's back room deals . 
ODRAMA has VOWED that the tax cuts will expire in Dec 2012 . 
That will increase the taxes on the rich by $ 70 billion and increase the taxes on everyone else by $ 300 billion per year . 
ODRAMA already has increased spending and government size and deficits to record levels . 
ODRAMA has never had a deficit below $ 1,293.5 TRILLION . 
No other president EVER had a deficit as high as $ 500 billion . 
EVER pushed obamacare through with threats and bribes to EVER own party and when passed and still today , the majority of the American People are against obamacare . 
Selling automatic weapons to criminals across our border is NOT the way to increase border security . 
EVER Stimulus bill cost the nation a TRILLION dollars OUR do n't have . 
And today OUR unemployment rate is higher than when the bill was passed which means by simple arithmetic , that there are fewer jobs now than when the bill was passed . 
Regardless of EVER lying claims . 
And the last two are obvious to anyone alive . 
And resisting tax increases that would not solve any problem -LRB- raising a mere $ 70 billion per year , MAYBE -RRB- and might cause more problems , is NOT asking for tax cuts for Snooki and Charlie Sheen . 
One other point about tax breaks . 
odrama is currently harping about special tax breaks for `` corporate jets . '' 
Do you know where those special tax breaks came from ??? 
odrama 's Stimulus bill , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Did you know that the debt commission that odrama formed , that ODRAMA hand-picked , to study ways to reduce our deficits and debt , RECOMMENDED that tax rates be LOWERED ? 
Think that might be why odrama IGNORED their report after THEIR gave REPORT to ODRAMA last Dec. ?

Palin 's a complete ass and she 'd be leagues better than odrama . 
Pawlenty would be better , Paul would be better , Cain would be better , The squirrel chattering in my back yard would be better . 
Hillary would be better .

We all know the candidates and the even more appaling solution CANDIDATES have for the problems . 
That is the problem CANDIDATES want to tackle , something like the debt limit wasnt even important enough for CANDIDATES shows CANDIDATES are completly incompetent for anything beyond macdonalds . 
BS WASNT idea would have driven USA of a cliff . 
WASNT thinks a default `` isnt a big deal '' Pawlenty cant even take a stand a year and a half before the elections , ron pauls idea are very extreme and unworkable cain talks about not wanting any muslims on PAWLENTY staff and even tough PAWLENTY was a ceo seems to have even less economy knowledge then palin .

Please , explain to me a few things \* Obama \* has done to help out the middle class ... and no , raising the unemployment rate does n't count ... and no extending unemployment compensation does not work either .

If you are one of the 10 million unemployed by the great recession , you are getting some help with unemployment because of Obama . 
If ONE were up to our Republican friends , there asses would be in the streets .

No , Obama cares exclusively about corporate interests .

Do none of the whining liberals NOT KNOW that the former employers are SUPPLIERS major suppliers of unemployment benefits ? 
Not the clown fool idiot odrama ? 
Employers MUST pay premiums for State unemployment insurance and Federal unemployment insurance . 
The employers build up a bank of unemployment funds . 
When SUPPLIERS lay some one off that fund is where the State gets the money for the unemployment check the person receives . 
And as an employers fund is drawn down , PERSON payments to replenish PERSON ` bank ' go UP . 
And those premiums go up permanently . 
Same is true of `` WORKMAN 'S COMPENSATION , '' benefits . 
The employer MUST pay into WC insurance . 
And the greater the risk for the industry , the higher the insurance costs are . 
Roofing companies for instance pay very high premiums per worker . 
So it is the employer , that is constantly threatened with higher taxes by liberals , that supplies the bulk of the money that politicians take credit for . 
And that money is not counted as a `` TAX ! ''

odrama 's ` solution ' was a larger debt with nothing to show for SOLUTION . 
ODRAMA failed solution has had 2.5 years to show results . 
SOLUTION failed . 
you may not like other candidates solutions , but trying something new is much better than to keep doing was has failed . 
That is simply insanity . 
And no one has proposed any solution that YOU could claim is worse than total and utter failure . 
And that IS what the clown fool idiot 's policies have been , failure . 
I 'd prefer to be wrong , but you 're the one that IS wrong but you just demagogue out of blind ideology . 
That is a big a danger to this nation as any outside source .

You 'd better get REFEREE a striped shirt and a bigger whistle because REFEREE 's a miserable referee . 
And you may find this SHOCKING , but REFEREE 's supposed to be a leader . 
Why do n't some of SOME liberals tell REFEREE that ? 
The rest of the nation has been screaming that at REFEREE but REFEREE is tone deaf to all but far left liberalism . 
And while you 're telling LEADER to be a leader , how about telling LEADER that 3 years of rerunning the same speech is enough . 
I could give LEADER speech I 've heard SPEECH so many times . 
But since I have INTEGRITY , I wo n't give LEADER repetitious speech .

This is just an observation , but , if there are lots of blacks , Hispanics and members of non-white groups , in the tea party , HISPANICS seem to be hiding well . 
Oh , when you hear about racial members of the tea party , HISPANICS are always forming MEMBERS own separate party -- is that because MEMBERS are frightened to go to the `` all white '' meetings ?

Kindly post the long list of tea party events you have attended yourself . 
US 've gone and US 'm a fish belly white Irishman so US can easily spot a person of color . 
And US have spotted , stood beside , and talked to people of color at every tea party event US 've been to . 
Are Blacks and Hispanics predominate at tea party rallies ? 
No BLACKS are not but neither are NEITHER predominate in US society . 
But Asians show up far out of proportion to society . 
And Asians tend to be good money managers , which would explain why MANAGERS are also unhappy with Washington . 
There can not be any justification for running up a deficit far exceeding a TRILLION dollars EVERY year when , 1 . 
revenue is down only $ 394.5 billion , or less than a third of the deficits being insanely posted . 
And 2 . 
No one ever had to have a deficit of even $ 500 billion before Democrats took over . 
$ 412 billion was the nations highest deficit prior to the Democrats taking control of Congress . 
Now AND routinely have deficits more than a TRILLION above the previous record by Republicans . 
And the Republicans are terrible money managers too . 
NOW is ONLY in comparison to the ultra insane spending Democrats that the Republicans look ` reasonable . '

If there were 100 TEA partiers in front of you and 80 were white\/Hispanic , 13 were black , 5 were Asian , 1 Native , 1 Native PI and 2 mixed race ... you would be looking at a TEA party that looks exactly like America ... not racism .

And never forget that this current deficit has been on a steady rise - with every president -LRB- except Clinton -RRB- since the great and wonderful Reagan Lowered the taxes to a foolish low level , and since then THEN have even dropped more and more .

FY 2007 the deficit was $ 161 billion . 
FY 2006 the deficit was higher than FY 2007 , FY 2005 the deficit was higher than FY 2006 , In others words the deficit was diminishing for 3 years in a row . 
NOT increasingNow FY 2007 the FEDERAL revenue was $ 2,568 trillion and we spent $ 161 billion more than that or $ 2,729 TRILLION . 
That can in no way be interpreted as GOOD . 
However AS OF YESTERDAY , with 41 days left in FY 2011 , WE Federal income projects to be $ 2,483 TRILLION . 
Or $ 85 billion less than AS was in FY2007 . 
But WE deficit projects to be $ 1,600 TRILLION . 
So WE 're short $ 85 billion in income and WE 've increased the deficit by a factor of 10 . 
WE had the same 2 wars going on and WE had the tax cuts in FY 2007 . 
How do you justify a deficit increasing TENFOLD on nearly the same income ?

Why does that matter ? 
Most blacks claim to be democrats . 
There are plenty of blacks in the tea party . 
Using your logic ... blacks are the only race who is n't racist ... so we must look at them to determine if the tea party is racist . 
It 's comical at best .
