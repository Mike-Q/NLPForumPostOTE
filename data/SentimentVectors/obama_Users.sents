1	3	Come on zero , take a stance ... LOL . 
3	3	Are ASPECT_AGENT_ZERO_ holding out for a deal ? 
4	5	I 'm not taking a stance on a 1\/4 of a term . 
5	5	When his term is over , I 'll give an answer . 
6	6	Would ASPECT_AGENT_ZERO_ vote for Palin ? 
7	7	Start providing some facts to back up HE statements . 
8	7	Even if some are true , that does n't mean he or SOME are wrong , only that conservatives do not agree . 
9	8	Are ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ freakin ' nutz ? 
10	8	Palin is a BIMBO ! 
11	9	So ASPECT_SLY_ 'll take a stance on Palin ... already made up ASPECT_SLY_ mind ... but STANCE 's to early to take a stance on Obama ??? 
12	9	That 's pretty funny ... 
13	11	Why would ASPECT_SLY_ agree with any of what I listed , assuming they are all correct ? 
14	12	That was the point I was proving . 
15	12	Folks have no idea how Palin would do , yet FOLKS would not vote for her , but FOLKS still have n't made up FOLKS minds about Obama , even though OBAMA has proven to be a disaster . 
17	13	Begin to soar ? 
19	13	WE say NO because we know how Obama is trying to -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- WE all . 
20	14	No I would not . 
21	14	And I know what ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ 're trying to do . 
22	14	I vehemently disagree with her . 
23	14	With Obama , I have to take more of a wait and see approach . 
24	14	Some things I have liked and others I have n't , so I 'll wait . 
25	15	I 'll vote for Obama over any of the Republicans now in the field . 
26	15	Obama has kept OBAMA campaign promises . 
27	15	OBAMA has n't gotten everything through yet , but CAMPAIGN 's early in OBAMA term . 
28	15	I do n't watch Fox so I have no trouble keeping up with what FOX 's doing .95 % of Americans got a tax cut this year and last . 
29	15	Does ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ 95 % include the world or something ? 
30	15	I do n't have a problem with the spending ; I know where PROBLEM 's going . 
31	15	PROBLEM 's way too early to worry about the deficit . 
32	15	PEOPLE are n't the people . 
33	15	Obama was legitimately elected as was congress . 
34	15	They 're doing what THEY said THEY 'd do while campaigning . 
35	15	Obama has n't weakened security in any way . 
36	15	I do n't watch Fox so I know about the terrorist plots that were just thwarted . 
37	15	Finally , Pakistan is going after Al Qaeda on THEY side of the border . 
38	15	That 's a pretty big coup . 
39	15	FOX has neither proposed nor passed any legislature that hurts Americans . 
40	15	FOX has strengthened the ties with our traditional allies . 
41	15	FOX has stood up to OUR enemies . 
42	15	I am not aware of a single instance where Obama lied . 
43	15	As far as the BS goes , Obama is a politician and ENEMIES all suffer from that a bit . 
44	16	Actually if ASPECT_RAPUNZEL_ notice , Sly already participated in the poll ... so not so funny . 
45	16	Instead a fail on ASPECT_RAPUNZEL_ part . 
46	18	Basically none of this will or can happen . 
47	19	So its a safe bet I wo n't vote for the man . 
48	19	Just as I suspected . 
49	20	Honestly I do n't know how ASPECT_SHPRARALAIN_ could possibly expect any Congress or President to give up their salary until every American got a job , which to I knowledge has never happened in the history of this country . 
50	20	Something tells I ASPECT_SHPRARALAIN_ expectations are completely unreasonable . 
51	21	ASPECT_KVMJ_ 're not worried about the spending . 
52	21	To early to worry about the deficit . 
53	21	Strengthened ties with our allies . 
54	21	Stood up to OUR enemies . 
55	21	Wow ... just wow . 
56	22	Obama has done a pretty good job as President , so already ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ thread is a big fat fail . 
57	22	And , as far as going down as the worst president surpassing Carter - I believe Georgie boy has already done that . 
58	22	And , this was a Rasmussen poll -LRB- right-leaning poll -RRB- - so , ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ second pronouncements is also erroneous . 
59	22	Do conservatives ever get anything right ? 
61	22	Jimmy Carter -LRB- 57 % favorable , 34 % unfavorable -RRB- 18 . 
62	22	William Taft -LRB- 57 % favorable , 15 % unfavorable -RRB- 19 . 
63	22	Woodrow Wilson -LRB- 56 % favorable , 19 % unfavorable -RRB- 20 . 
64	22	Bill Clinton -LRB- 55 % favorable , 41 % unfavorable -RRB- 21 . 
65	22	James Monroe -LRB- 49 % favorable , 10 % unfavorable -RRB- 22 . 
66	22	Herbert Hoover -LRB- 48 % favorable , 34 % unfavorable -RRB- 23 . 
67	22	Lyndon B. Johnson -LRB- 45 % favorable , 42 % unfavorable -RRB- 24 . 
68	22	Andrew Johnson -LRB- 45 % favorable , 26 % unfavorable -RRB- 25 . 
69	22	Chester Arthur -LRB- 43 % favorable , 17 % unfavorable -RRB- 26 . 
70	22	James A. Garfield -LRB- 42 % favorable , 16 % unfavorable -RRB- 27 . 
71	22	William McKinley -LRB- 42 % favorable , 24 % unfavorable -RRB- 28 . 
72	22	George W. Bush -LRB- 41 % favorable , 59 % unfavorable -RRB- The Worst President in History ? 
73	22	One of America 's leading historians assesses George W. BushSEAN WILENTZPosted Apr 21 , 2006 12:34 PMFlashback : Bush in '99 -- We Warned ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ ! 
74	22	George W. Bush 's presidency appears headed for colossal historical disgrace . 
75	22	Gee , conservatives expected BUSH to accomplish all BUSH promises by Jan 21 , 2009 , so of course CONSERVATIVES are disappointed . 
76	22	More so than Bush . 
77	22	Another lie . 
78	22	ANOTHER has not raised taxes . 
79	22	To undo what George Bush did - and it has helped . 
80	22	We 'd be in a depression if a Republican was in office . 
81	22	Never mind when Bush was doing DEPRESSION , at least Obama is doing DEPRESSION to help not help BUSH , like Bush . 
82	22	Bwahaha , BWAHAHA ignores the Party of No and all NO followers , uses same tactics used by Republicans , which I guess FOLLOWERS have forgotten . 
83	22	Another big fat lie being propagated by GOP . 
84	22	Another big fat lie . 
85	22	BWAHAHA has done more for world peace than that Bozo , war monger Bush ever did . 
86	22	We had more enemies because of Bush . 
87	22	The Republican party and REPUBLICAN cohorts , i.e. Fox News , Sarah Palin , Limbaugh and the motley crew at Faux News are the ones spewing lies . 
88	22	Hell yes , ten times over any republican clown the GOP puts up . 
89	23	This from someone that did n't worry about Bush 's spending , or the fact that Bush had a surplus and blew SPENDING and handed Obama a deficit . 
90	23	And yes , Obama has strengthened ties with our allies and stoop up to OUR enemies , the fact that ASPECT_RAPUNZEL_ are are n't aware of YES is because OBAMA does YES with finesse , not like the buffoon OUR had before . 
91	23	i.e. Bush = `` I.E. 'm the Decider '' ! 
92	24	Obama 's approval rating is 47 % . 
93	24	OBAMA term average is 57 % The average for US Presidents -LRB- since FDR -RRB- is 55 % , so OBAMA is doing better than that . 
94	24	ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ beloved Reagan had 44 % at the same time in office as Obama . 
95	24	-LRB- So Obama is doing better -RRB- . 
96	24	Maybe ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ should open ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ eyes . 
97	24	What is dangerous for America is the GOP with all AMERICA whackos . 
98	24	Beginning with Sarah Palin , Michele Bachmann , the Tea Baggers and other 's who have advocated violence , who makes inciting comments like `` Do n't retreat - reload '' and `` Next time ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ 'll come armed '' . 
99	24	What a bunch of uncivilized nitwits . 
100	24	Who are ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ that US should worry about being penalized ? 
101	25	Not really . 
102	25	Their salaries are a stipend . 
103	25	STIPEND 's all about power . 
104	26	ASPECT_MERTEX_ answers are that of a typical blind Obama sheep . 
105	26	OBAMA will be the worst President . 
106	26	OBAMA will not keep OBAMA promise about tax cuts for 95 % of Americans . 
107	26	OBAMA HCR bill is proof of that . 
108	26	OBAMA wants the VAT for Christ 's sake . 
109	26	What do ASPECT_MERTEX_ think that is ? 
110	26	OBAMA DOHS has stopped enforcing immigration laws . 
111	26	They have tied the hands of local law enforcement agencies in seeking illegal aliens . 
112	26	DOHS has cut border agents . 
113	26	DOHS has weakened our border security , thus , or national security . 
114	26	Cap & Tax is next , then amnesty . 
115	26	Destructive for America . 
116	26	None of what I said are lies . 
117	26	ASPECT_MERTEX_ will see . 
118	27	Obama is on OBAMA way down . 
119	27	The Tea Party folks are Americans of all walks of life . 
120	27	Open ASPECT_MERTEX_ eyes . 
121	27	FOLKS have not advocated violence - ASPECT_MERTEX_ lie there . 
122	28	He has , in fact , already signed 640 billion in tax hikes , 14 of which violate HE promise to 95 % of Americans . 
123	28	Source : http:\/\/online.wsj.com\/article\/SB1000...943720638.html 
124	29	How can I take a stance whenever he has pleased and disappointed I at the same time ? 
125	29	Perhaps it is easier for ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ because the situation is black and white -- with a 'D ' next to HE name , ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ mind was decided . 
126	31	I do n't care what letter he has next to HE name . 
127	31	HE is an utter failure and a fraud . 
128	32	So that is how conservatives vote ? 
129	32	Wondering how someone would do ? 
130	32	Interesting , no wonder THAT voted in Bush . 
131	32	Palin has already proven herself to not know much . 
132	32	Why would anyone with a brain consider HERSELF `` just to see how HERSELF would do '' ? 
133	32	HERSELF would totally destroy the country , that is how HERSELF would do . 
134	32	Obama is doing fine . 
135	32	The only ones finding fault with the things OBAMA is doing are the neo-cons , right-wing , tea baggers , not much to consider . 
136	32	Palin criticized Obama for OBAMA stance on reducing nuclear weapons . 
137	32	Did she even bother to check that Reagan was trying to do the same thing ? 
138	32	So , Reagan , ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ idol was right , but Obama is wrong ? 
139	32	Bwahaha - just goes to show conservatives do n't know much about anything except complaining . 
140	33	Of course not , that is why poster claimed they would vote for Obama . 
141	33	All the right-wingers can do is whine and cry and belly-ache , because THEY are not in power . 
142	33	I wonder if BELLY-ACHE would require the same of a Rep ? 
143	33	I wonder if a Rep would even consider any of REP requests ? 
145	34	Not to mention insane ! 
146	35	That said from someone whose posts exhibit total ovine behavior - BAAAAAAAA ! 
147	35	THAT doubt that anyone will topple Bush out of that position . 
148	35	HCR is the best thing that could have happened to this country . 
149	35	As THING is refined , more and more people -LRB- except the right-wing sheep -RRB- will be able to see and Obama will get the credit OBAMA deserves . 
150	35	THING is time for the right to quit trying to control what Obama does or does n't do , ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ had ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ chance and ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ blew THING , with Bush . 
151	35	The same sing-song sung by the right . 
152	35	Enough with the racial profiling , fence building and other non-sensical methods applied by the right . 
153	35	There are other ways to destroy America , and that would be to hand control over to the right . 
154	35	Bush did n't have cap & trade and BUSH nearly destroyed the US . 
155	35	Well , being that ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ have already been proven wrong -LRB- ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ said Obama had not been able to do anything OBAMA promised -RRB- , it is hard to believe anything the right says . 
156	37	Rove is a liar . 
157	37	It 's all ROVE ever does . 
158	38	ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ 've been saying that since Jan 21 , 2009 ! 
159	38	His ratings are going up , so enough of ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ lies . 
160	38	As long as Palin and the rest of the conservatives keep denying REST , REST will continue . 
161	38	I 'm sure most conservatives are aware of what is going on , but CONSERVATIVES play the innocent card , and pretend that what CONSERVATIVES do does not incite violence . 
162	38	Maybe ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ need to take ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ own advice and open `` ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ '' eyes . 
163	38	In the subsequent segment , titled DANGEROUS RHETORIC : When heated words incite threats & violence , CNN s panel agreed Obama s political opponents are inciting violence and are motivated by racism -- undeterred by Palin s assurance , which CNN played : When I talk about SEGMENT 's not a time to retreat , SEGMENT 's a time to reload , what I 'm talking about -- now , media , try to get this right , okay ? 
164	38	That 's not inciting violence . 
165	38	What that 's doing is trying to inspire people to get involved in PEOPLE local elections and these upcoming federal elections . 
166	38	SEGMENT 's telling people that PEOPLE arms are PEOPLE votes . 
167	38	SEGMENT 's not inciting violence . 
168	38	SEGMENT 's telling people , do n't ever let anybody tell ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ to sit down and shut up , Americans . 
169	38	Lemon demanded : Is LEMON responsible for someone to say that ? 
170	38	Especially a leader , considering the anger that 's going on right now ? 
171	38	Read more : http:\/\/newsbusters.org\/blogs\/brent-b...#ixzz0lPKYdBNLAnother example : Like disobeying orders from the Commander in Chief ? 
172	38	If not violent , then just total whackos ? 
173	38	Is n't this just plain treason , and ignored by ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ party . 
174	38	Are these the kinds of idiots we need in the military ? 
175	38	In promoting the Armed Forces Tea Party Patriots , Stein has raised the possibility of disobeying presidential orders . 
176	38	In one recent online posting , STEIN wrote : I oath was to the Constitution , not to the politicians , and that oath will be kept . 
177	38	I wo n't `` Just follow '' orders . 
178	38	There is at this time a debate within the ranks of the military regarding POLITICIANS oath . 
179	38	Some mistakenly believe SOME must follow any order the President issues . 
180	38	But many others do understand that OTHERS loyalty is to the Constitution and to the people ... That declaration echoes one made by the Oath Keepers , a group of current and former military and law enforcement personnel who havevowed not to follow orders deemed to be unconstitutional -- including any orders to disarm Americans . 
181	38	Stein agreed that the two groups are kindred spirits . 
182	38	`` STEIN think GROUPS 're very like-minded with the Oathkeepers , '' STEIN said . 
183	38	`` STEIN strongly support the Oathkeepers . 
184	38	`` Stein 's political activism seems to have raised some concern among STEIN superiors . 
185	38	Late last month , STEIN wrote online : `` Was just told by a Marine Corps Officer to watch what STEIN say about Obama ... STEIN think not ... '' And later that same day : `` STEIN was just told to keep STEIN opinons -LRB- sic -RRB- to STEIN about Obama , by STEIN Officer-in-Charge -LRB- OIC -RRB- . 
186	38	`` Indeed , Stein may be violating military policies that restrict political statements and activities by active duty personnel . 
187	38	`` LEBOWITZ 've seen military command go against people on a lot less , '' Mike Lebowitz , a former JAG lawyer who 's an expert on issues of military expression , told TPMmuckraker . 
188	38	Lebowitz said one key question is whether the activity is judged to be `` partisan . '' 
189	38	Though the Tea Party movement has formed political parties in a few states , and has endorsed and supported candidates in some races , there 's no evidence that Stein 's group has done so . 
190	38	WASHINGTON -LRB- CBS\/AP -RRB- Political pundits knew health care reform was going to upset critics and the `` tea party '' contingent , but PUNDITS probably did n't expect things to get violent . 
191	38	The Democratic leadership in Congress is decrying recent `` acts of violence '' against 10 House Democrats and one Republican , including one report of a cut gas line at the house of the brother of one member of Congress . 
192	38	House Republican Leader John Boehner , R-Ohio , says BOEHNER knows that people are angry but denounced the disturbing trend , saying , `` Threats and violence should not be part of a political debate . '' 
193	38	Former governor of Alaska Sarah Palin criticized the media for casting CBS\/AP and tea party activists as violent . 
195	39	Boy , do I agree with ASPECT_MERTEX_ . 
196	39	Besides , the next fight up will be financial regulation , not cap and trade . 
197	41	Evidence please , irrefutable evidence . 
199	42	Let 's see how some what America looks like in the summer of 2012 . 
200	43	Unless Jesus runs against JESUS , I will be voting for Obama in 2012 . 
201	44	Valerie Plame scandal . 
202	44	By his own words too . 
204	46	Bush did brilliantly in BUSH first year , and look how BUSH turned out . 
205	46	First years do not represent a whole presidency . 
206	46	As for being penalized by ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ , golly . 
207	46	I darn near quivered in I boots . 
208	47	If that 's pretty funny , ASPECT_RAPUNZEL_ sense of humor is pretty crap . 
209	47	Try watching the Daily Show . 
210	47	Or maybe Borat . 
211	47	SNL even . 
212	48	I 'd rather have I eyes gouged out with crayons and I insides ripped apart by feral rats . 
213	49	It sounds to ASPECT_SHPRARALAIN_ like his opinion , and opinions do n't require evidencing . 
214	49	Incidentally , are ASPECT_SHPRARALAIN_ currently living in Nigeria ? 
215	49	`` Location : God 's greatest Country `` Google search : God 's greatest nation : http:\/\/www.nairaland.com\/nigeria\/topic-98070.0.html 
216	50	I 'm guessing that 's a no. . 
217	51	Hmm ... I suppose NO. might seem that way but I actually quite enjoy the whole crayon thing Yep , NO. 's a no. . 
218	51	Those who love America could never condemn her by voting for Sarahsquatch . 
219	56	This poll means little without an actual opponent to choose from . 
220	56	Some `` yes '' answers can become `` no '' , and some `` no '' answers can become `` yes '' depending on the catalog\/experience\/vision of the other person running . 
221	57	Most of ASPECT_KVMJ_ post is delusional , especially the part about Obama not having lied . 
222	57	I am suggesting that ASPECT_KVMJ_ pull ASPECT_KVMJ_ head out of the sand . 
223	58	Pull ASPECT_MERTEX_ head out of the sand . 
224	58	Quit living in ASPECT_MERTEX_ false liberal utopia . 
225	59	ASPECT_MERTEX_ entire post is nothing but ignorant , liberal utopian garbage . 
226	59	Wake up ! 
227	60	He stated facts . 
228	60	Would ASPECT_KVMJ_ believe it more if the article was written by Karl Marx ? 
229	61	Of course liberals are trying to portray the Tea Party folks in a bad light . 
230	61	LIBERALS are afraid of LIBERALS . 
231	61	The fact is that nobody has proof that the Tea Party folks have been violent or racist in the least bit . 
232	61	Sorry , but ASPECT_MERTEX_ failed . 
233	62	ASPECT_ELDEDU_ just told me that first years do not represent an entire Presidency , ye Palin has not even had that , yet ASPECT_ELDEDU_ say what ASPECT_ELDEDU_ say . 
234	62	Kind of hypocritical , is n't KIND ? 
236	63	That assumes we should vote for everyone regardless of stance , then judge after 4 years . 
237	63	There 's no contradiction is saying ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ would n't vote for someone -LRB- if ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ 're completely against them -RRB- and also state that ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ 'll wait for an entire Presidency to transpire before giving an accurate synopsis . 
238	63	CONTRADICTION 's like saying : `` No , ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ 'm not going to read Dr. Suess at age 45 , but this biography on European conquest ? 
239	63	ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ 'll wait 'til ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ 'm finished reading CONTRADICTION to give ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ a rating . '' 
240	64	ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ do realize that a lot of the disapproval comes from liberals who are upset with Obama for not ending the wars and not closing Gitmo , right ? 
241	64	Those people are not going to vote for a Republican . 
242	64	PEOPLE may hold PEOPLE nose when PEOPLE pull the lever , but NOSE will be for Obama . 
243	65	No room for independents on this one , ASPECT_AGENT_ZERO_ guys have to pick a side . 
244	66	Reverse that and what answer do YOURSELF come up with ? 
245	66	-LRB- b -RRB- Look at these approval numbers . 
246	66	See any pattern ? 
247	66	, now ask ASPECT_DEVIL505_ what has he done for the black unemployment problem . 
249	67	No , not really . 
250	67	Palin has not been president , therefore the only things I have to judge NO on are NO governorship -LRB- which has come to its end -RRB- and what NO says in public , and I am disgusted by both . 
251	68	Is Karl Marx a member of this forum or are ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ just so desperate to change the subject that ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ had a massive brain fart ? 
252	69	Because formulating a counterargument is much harder than simply attacking the post 's content . 
253	71	Next time someone asks for a link on any opinion , I will refer them to ASPECT_ELDEDU_ , if I may . 
254	72	Feel free . 
255	72	But first make clear to them that FIRST 's ASPECT_SHPRARALAIN_ opinion . 
257	73	What has he done for the black unemployment problem ? 
258	73	Looks to me like many American 's have been hurting since the Spring of 2007 . 
259	74	ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ ca n't `` pick a side '' without 2 sides to choose from . 
260	74	The poll does n't include an opponent ... hence , POLL 's useless . 
261	75	Well then , they like the abuse . 
262	76	I did n't change the subject . 
263	76	ASPECT_ELDEDU_ said that Karl Rove lied . 
264	76	I said ROVE did not . 
265	76	The facts are the facts . 
266	77	Well , when ASPECT_ELDEDU_ feel like ASPECT_ELDEDU_ are debating a brick wall , then ASPECT_ELDEDU_ wo n't waste ASPECT_ELDEDU_ time . 
267	77	That is what I am doing . 
268	78	I just wanted to know if anyone who voted for him would have the courage to vote for someone else since Obama is an utter failure and a fraud . 
269	79	Jesus ... If there my friggin choices i 'm voting indy again . 
270	79	Politics with Dumb and Dumber , the only difference is Palin would be the first president MY would n't mind seeing naked ... LOL 
271	80	NOW 's a LOT WORSE NOW !!! 
273	80	.6 % http:\/\/biggovernment.com\/ldoan\/2010\/...-obama-policieThe Obama Administration is putting the best face on the Bureau of Labor Statistics -LRB- BLS -RRB- recent March 2010 jobless numbers report , touting the steady nationwide jobless number of 9.7 % . 
274	80	But for minorities , the news is bad and getting worse . 
275	80	Great Depression Unemployment Line . 
276	80	JPGThe really bad news is buried in the middle of the 38 page report . 
277	80	The BLS data reveals an alarming and growing divergence between the number of white and the number of minorities that are unemployed . 
278	80	Worse yet , it is clear that minorities , especially African Americans , are falling further behind . 
279	80	If unchecked , the long term implications of that imbalance are nightmarish for the nation . 
280	80	Larry Summers and others in the Administration have not yet shown much interest in the appalling unemployment rates for minorities and , instead , exude childlike enthusiasm at the nation s overall jobless rate that held steady for the 2nd consecutive month . 
281	80	While the unemployment for white Americans averaged 9.3 % , African Americans averaged 16.6 % , just a little less than double the rate of white unemployment . 
282	80	Hispanic Americans reported 13.3 % unemployment , while recent , young veterans are averaging 14.7 % . 
283	80	Black men , over 20 years old , are showing 20.2 % unemployment and teenaged , African Americans , ages 16-19 , of both sexes , show a mind-boggling 39.3 % unemployed . 
284	80	Hispanic teens also report a staggering 30.3 % unemployment . 
285	80	The long-term repercussions of these unemployment numbers are troubling , yet the Administration is curiously silent . 
286	81	Kinda refutes the whole idea the right-wingers are espousing about how Obama is giving away jobs to OBAMA fellow blacks at the expense of the whites , does n't KINDA ? 
287	81	Personally , I believe that , as a culture , we Americans are becoming a bunch of wimps who are afraid of WE own shadows . 
288	81	That picture of the Great Depression is a good example . 
290	82	We watched Bush do most of this for 4 years and then WE re-elected BUSH did n't WE ? 
291	83	We were expected to come out of this , that 's the way WE economy works , that 's Capitalism . 
292	83	As far as the fears of jobs I do not believe anybody claimed that yet , those fears were with useless Green jobs designed exactly for that . 
293	83	I 'm sure ASPECT_DIVINE_WIND_ realize that . 
294	83	Lets go back to the original argument , why is his approval over ninety percent with them ? 
295	83	Actually close to 95 % , ARGUMENT 's absurd there is no reason for that . 
296	84	He was supposed to be the UN-BUSH , , , , , Remember ? 
297	85	So its ok to call Palin names , but if I were to call Obama something racist , the out cry would be unbearable , RACIST an interesting stance ASPECT_SLY_ liberals take . 
298	86	COURAGE doubt INTENTION , but if that be ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ true intention , INTENTION would be smart to start by actually naming who they should `` have the courage '' to vote for . 
299	87	lol Wait ... if someone calls Palin `` a name '' , the only thing ASPECT_SOUTH_POLE_RESIDENT_ can think to do is bring racism into NAME ? 
300	87	Why not just equally call PALIN a name ? 
301	88	-RRB- -RRB- -RRB- This is probably the most inane of all of the tea party whines . 
302	88	Every year since the first constitutional CONVENTION the size of government has increased TO RECORD LEVELS . 
303	88	The country has gotten bigger every year TO RECORD LEVELS . 
304	88	Wtf , man ? 
305	91	Why would n't he ? 
306	92	Karl Rove is a liar . 
307	92	ROVE does n't know how to tell the truth . 
308	92	ROVE 's the one that said to Ron Susskind , '' `` in what we call the reality-based community , '' which SUSSKIND defined as people who `` believe that solutions emerge from ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ judicious study of discernible reality . '' 
309	92	... `` That 's not the way the world really works anymore , '' ROVE continued . 
310	92	`` WE 're an empire now , and when WE act , WE create WE own reality . 
311	92	And while ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ 're studying that reality judiciously , as ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ will WE 'll act again , creating other new realities , which ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ can study too , and that 's how things will sort out . 
312	92	ACTORS 're history 's actors and ACTORS , all of ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ , will be left to just study what WE do . '' 
313	94	So ASPECT_FARRA_ do n't like Obama because OBAMA 's smarter than other people and OBAMA knows it ? 
314	94	Oh dear . 
315	94	I hope ASPECT_FARRA_ did n't go to an Ivy . 
316	95	I was asking ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ why ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ brought Karl Marx into it . 
317	95	I never mentioned Karl Rove , much less called ROVE a liar . 
318	95	Are ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ high or just confused ? 
319	96	Sorry Eldedu I was n't clear enugh for ASPECT_ELDEDU_ I dislike Obama because OBAMA has not figure out who OBAMA wants to be yet and OBAMA does n't know it . 
320	96	We are watching OBAMA morph from a lesser University law lecturer turn into godlike proportions because of OBAMA great press who desperately want OBAMA tobe what OBAMA promises . 
321	96	Trouble with promise ? 
322	96	Some day ASPECT_ELDEDU_ have to deliver . 
323	96	No eastern schools for I - SLO and USC ... I doubt I couild get into an eastern school - not enough pedigree . 
324	97	President Obama campaigned on redistribution of wealth and health care reform . 
325	97	OBAMA promise was met . 
326	97	President Obama is no elitist , Sarah Palin makes those accusations regularly and their unfounded . 
327	97	THEIR both have college degrees , I do n't see how one is `` elite '' and the other is not . 
328	99	Do n't know yet . 
329	99	My poll was based on the fact that Obama is nothing like OBAMA portrayed OBAMA to be during OBAMA campaign -LRB- except the distribution of welath thing , which OBAMA is certainly doing -RRB- , and if anyone would change their mind based on that fact . 
330	100	Since ASPECT_ELDEDU_ bring it up , how about ASPECT_ELDEDU_ ? 
331	101	Obama is going to town with spending\/deficit increases , and OBAMA has just been in there for a little over a year . 
332	101	I think OBAMA will dwarf every other President . 
333	102	Good post . 
334	102	More and more folks are feeling this way as FOLKS open FOLKS eyes and see the fraud that Obama is . 
335	103	The tax increases that he mentioned in HE article are the facts . 
336	103	FAN do n't know about other things HE may have said . 
337	103	FAN am not a fan of or a fact-checker for Karl Rove . 
338	103	FAN just know that the tax increases implemented by Obama in the neighborhood of 640 billion so far , are a fact of life right now . 
339	104	I may have gotten ASPECT_ELDEDU_ confused with KVMJ . 
340	106	I agree totally . 
341	106	He seems un-American . 
342	106	Many people see that . 
343	107	Probably because he has their trust even though 16 months into HE 48 month term the results are still lacking . 
344	107	Time will tell if the trust the voters put into HE is earned or if VOTERS 'll give someone else a chance at bat . 
345	108	He campaigned on providing all americans with affordable health care and redistribution of wealth . 
346	108	Tax breaks for the rich would have never acheived this , America knew RICH was going to be liberal . 
347	108	RICH said americans making over 200k a year would be taxed more , and that is whats happening . 
348	108	If george w bush provided health care reform the same way there would have been no outcry . 
349	109	He 's just like HE portrayed HE in HE campaign . 
350	109	Did ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ ever listen to a speech ? 
351	110	What utter non sense ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ 're agreeing with . 
353	112	ASPECT_DIVINE_WIND_ can look at a poll like that and give a benefit of a doubt ? 
354	112	They went from loving the Clinton 's to vilifying THEY . 
355	112	What reason would THEY have to have CLINTON trust ? 
356	112	I 'll take wagers ... 
357	113	Other than gang members , KKK members , members of militias , serial killers , rapists , sex offenders , arsonists , radical members of any and all religions , etc. . 
358	113	Other than all of them , MAN may well be the most dangerous man in America . 
359	113	Do ASPECT_FROGGER_ always exaggerate this much ? 
360	114	Who 's they ?

364	115	But in US defense , US a. -RRB- Did n't attend university in the US , and b. -RRB- do n't have a problem with people who are smarter than US and know US . 
366	116	Just maybe . 
367	117	When Obama came on the scene the black people turned PEOPLE backs on the Clintons PEOPLE hated PEOPLE , that 's who 
369	118	Are there any articles on this event because I do n't recall it . 
370	118	I do know that , when given the choice between HRC and Obama , Obama 's campaign began to quickly pick up the minority votes as CHOICE became more viable . 
371	118	IIRC , earlier in the year , IIRC was almost a given that HRC would gain the nomination . 
372	118	Obama was an interesting candidate , but not many think OBAMA could take HRC in the primary . 
373	118	HRC was only as the primary approached that PRIMARY appeared OBAMA could win PRIMARY . 
374	118	As a member of the GOP , I was rooting for Sen. Thompson for several reasons ... one of which was seeing Mrs. Thompson in the White House for four years . 
375	119	She is wearing my negligee , MY swear . 
376	121	Thanks for the link , but I still do n't get ASPECT_FLOUNDER_ point : 
377	122	Point is simple , Devil said back at my original chart that many white voters wont vote for Obama because of color . 
378	122	That 's real hypocritical when ASPECT_DIVINE_WIND_ see the way the blacks have voted . 
379	122	BLACKS give DEVIL a 95 % approval rating when DEVIL has not done a thing for BLACKS , BLACKS have double digit unemployment and NONE of BLACKS have a problem with that ? 
380	122	Then to further look at BLACKS voting record look how BLACKS voted against Clinton , a person that HAS helped BLACKS for how many years ? 
381	122	BLACKS vote is obviously racist , the numbers are right there . 
382	122	A 16 % percent grab of BLACKS vote is an absurdity . 
383	122	Just like 95 % approval is . 
384	123	It does n't matter who implemented this kind of HCR , IT would still have been met with the same resistance . 
386	124	Tax breaks for 95 % of Americans ? 
387	124	No earmarks ? 
388	124	Not business as usual ? 
389	124	Think again . 
390	125	That 's what THAT said . 
391	125	Open ASPECT_KVMJ_ eyes . 
392	126	Many black folks have opened FOLKS eyes to Obama , and have no intention of voting for OBAMA again . 
393	127	I can assure ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ , if George W Bush implemented this health care reform the same way , everyone would have believed that REFORM would have reduced the defecit . 
394	128	Every American , or the majority would still be against anything forced , what do ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ not understand about that ? 
395	128	ME also have to question ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ belief about a reduced deficit , please show ME where this has been done before or anything that has come close to their estimates . 
396	129	He tried that . 
397	129	Congress likes CONGRESS backroom deals too much . 
398	129	Place the blame where CONGRESS belongs , not on whom ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ prefer to despise . 
399	129	There are no transitional fossils ! 
400	129	He effectively reduced . 
401	129	Be realistic . 
402	129	For congress . 
403	129	Far from business as usual from this president . 
404	130	So the country has tripled ? 
405	131	I do n't believe that at all ... 
406	132	He would have been vilified as a sneaky socialist dipping into the American peoples pockets even more to give there money to others . 
408	133	Speculating ... False . 
409	133	`` W '' inherited over 1 + trillion dollar National Debt from the Clinton administration . 
410	133	In CLINTON 1st year in office , our beloved `` Spender-N-Chief '' Obama increased the deficit , spent 3.5 trillion dollars and added over 1.5 + trillion dollars to The National Debt , a new record . 
411	133	Come 2012 , Obama will have added over 5 + trillion dollars to The National Debt in just 4 short years . 
413	133	Isreal 's support for President Obama continues to decline . 
414	133	President Obama dropped bombs in Pakistan , Afghanistan and Yemen murdering precious life 's innocent blood . 
415	133	Furthermore , `` the war of necessity '' -LRB- Afghanistan `` conflict '' -RRB- that President Obama once labeled proceeds on with marginal protests by the Left Wing `` moonbats '' One nation under a bufoon of a President Obama , about as sharp as a bowling ball ... 
417	134	, what ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ are looking at is the Bradley effect , only opposite ... When they go vote EFFECT will be Obama , bet on EFFECT . 
419	136	Wrong assumption . 
420	136	I voted for GWB , but would not have been for HCR the way GWB has been done , nor would I believe that any government entitlement program would reduce the deficit . 
423	138	Does n't matter what ASPECT_CALM2CHAOS_ believe . 
425	139	Because he is 1\/2 Black ? 
426	139	Many do n't care that HE is 1\/2 Back . 
427	139	MANY see HE for what HE is ... a statist . 
428	139	MANY do n't like 1\/2 . 
429	140	Bradly effect ... Bet ASPECT_CALM2CHAOS_ Bippy . 
431	143	EldeduOne more point regarding ASPECT_ELDEDU_ remark about higher education . 
432	143	Surprisingly one thing ASPECT_ELDEDU_ find out in attending universities is attendance , even completing all the requirements and passing with a diploma once completed ... ... . 
433	143	does not make a person more intellectual ... . 
434	143	only more educated ... . 
435	143	which in THING depends upon what that person does with the education . 
436	144	Dear Dear Frogger Of the many posts which have inspired me , or moved ME , or made ME think , or laugh , or cry ... The above post ASPECT_FROGGER_ have delivered , nails exactly what is in ME heart about the man in the White House . 
437	144	FROGGER is not , nor will never be , a President to ME . 
438	145	The only reason we are afraid of them is because ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ never know when another McVeigh is going to emerge from the Tea Baggers group , and how many innocent people would be hurt , not because PEOPLE have any credibility or any substance . 
439	145	The only proof WE have is how most conservatives come to CONSERVATIVES defense and deny CONSERVATIVES are racist . 
440	146	No doubt about it ! 
441	146	I like his determination . 
442	147	Bobo was Bush . 
443	147	Bobo is gone , -LRB- good riddance . -RRB- 
444	147	Get with the latest ! 
445	148	That 's a no-brainer . 
446	148	Who could the GOP possibly put up ? 
447	148	Paiin , McCain , Romney , Paul - they 're all losers , not hard to predict . 
448	149	The only ones with their heads in the sand , are the desperate conservatives as CONSERVATIVES try to convince the country that things are bad under Obama . 
449	149	People are able to see for PEOPLE - ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ strategy is n't working . 
450	150	ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ do n't like my post because as a loyal , Palin idolizer , ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ ca n't handle the truth . 
451	150	Keep spreading ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ `` gloom and doom '' - nobody believes that trash anyway , except other comatose conservatives . 
453	151	Palin has n't served as President , so of course she has n't had that ! 
454	151	We do n't need to put SHE in that position to affirm the fact that SHE is stupid , that SHE thinks SHE knows a lot about politics because SHE followers drool over everything SHE says . 
455	151	There are people other than the droolers , and WE do n't give SHE a pass - and ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ would have to be comatose to vote for SHE . 
457	152	The only reason ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ feel like ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ are debating a brick wall is because ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ have a skewed opinion and wo n't admit facts that contradict OPINION , when given to ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ . 
458	152	Of course I 'm not going to agree with the lies being spewed here . 
459	153	Geez , like ASPECT_SOUTH_POLE_RESIDENT_ have n't called Obama names ? 
460	153	And , the fact that Palin is a bimbo has nothing to do with her being white , HER is just dumb , WHITE does n't matter what color HER is . 
461	154	Could it be because even dumb Sarah is able to recognize that Obama graduated from Harvard , Magna Cum Laude , while SARAH attended 5 colleges , and SARAH still does n't know much ? 
462	155	No speculation . 
463	155	Most conservatives on this forum adored Bush , warts and all , and would never have criticized anything BUSH did . 
464	155	Is that according to the Republican 's rewriting of History ? 
465	155	Bill Clinton reversed Reagan 's course , raising taxes on the wealthy , and lowering WEALTHY for the working and middle classes . 
466	155	This produced the longest sustained economic expansion in American history . 
467	155	Importantly , THIS also produced budgetary surpluses allowing the government to begin paying down the crippling debt begun under Reagan . 
468	155	In 2000 , Clinton 's last year , the surplus amounted to $ 236 billion . 
469	155	The forecast ten year surplus stood at $ 5.6 trillion . 
470	155	It was the last black ink America would see for decades , perhaps forever . 
471	155	George W. Bush immediately reversed Clinton 's policy in order to revive Reagan 's , once again showering an embarrassment of riches on the already most embarrassingly rich , BUSH `` base '' as BUSH calls them . 
472	155	BUSH ladled out some $ 630 billion in tax cuts to the top 1 % of income earners . 
473	155	In true Republican fashion , EARNERS returned the favor by investing over $ 200 million to ensure Bush 's re-election . 
474	155	Do the math . 
475	155	A $ 630 billion return on a $ 200 million investment : $ 3,160 for $ 1 . 
476	155	I 'll give ASPECT_REDRUM_ $ 3,160 . 
477	155	All I ask is that ASPECT_REDRUM_ give I $ 1 back so I can keep the goodness flowing . 
478	155	Do we have a deal ? 
479	155	Republicans know return on investment . 
480	155	What ASPECT_REDRUM_ forget to mention is that doing nothing would have put WE in a depression . 
481	155	Obama had to do major surgery to repair the damage caused by Bush . 
482	155	WE owe all WE thanks to Bush ! 
483	155	Israel is not the world , but still , that is just conservative rhetoric . 
484	155	Obama supports Israel . 
485	155	Apr 9 , 2010Do ASPECT_REDRUM_ approve or disapprove of the Obama administration 's handling of U.S.-Israel relations ? 
486	155	A new , annual survey of American Jewish public opinion by the American Jewish Committee finds that Jews , by and large , continue to approve of Obama 57 percent say they approve of the job OBAMA 's doing and also back OBAMA handling of Israel . 
487	155	http:\/\/www.politico.com\/blogs\/bensmi...on_Israel.html Well , it is apparent that Republicans do not like Obama , but to take WELL to the level of lying about OBAMA presidency is totally wild . 
488	155	The only buffoon we 've had was Bush and thank God BUSH is history -LRB- bad history at that -RRB- . 
489	156	What conservative rock did ASPECT_SEC_ crawl out from ? 
490	156	Where did ASPECT_SEC_ hear that Health Care was free , on Faux News ? 
491	156	No wonder . 
492	156	The rest of ASPECT_SEC_ post sounds like something Limbaugh mentioned on one of his loony rants . 
493	158	Consider Sarah Palin as Idi Amin - they both have the same IQ . 
495	159	Now this is one accurate post ! 
496	159	Good job ! 
497	162	-RRB- -RRB- -RRB- He probably will dwarf every other president . 
498	162	I 'm pretty sure that HE would have preferred to take office after Clinton than after Bush . 
499	163	I would need proof of that , I still think ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ will see a huge vote for color in the upcoming election , same as the last . 
500	164	If Obama has let banks fail , and not pushed a stimulus of the size OBAMA did , we would currently be facing similar situations as took place in the 1920 's and 1930 's , runs on banks , 25-30 % unemployment , a return of the Hoovervilles . 
501	164	Obama , if for no other reason will be favorably looked upon 50-100 years from now as the one who had the courage to take a risk , and invest in America , instead of pulling everything in , and letting COURAGE all die . 
502	164	Do ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ really know what a VAT is ? 
503	164	Most people who are calling for a flat tax , or a major change to taxation are in favor of methods similar to a VAT , because unlike the Income tax , with all of it 's loopholes , a Value Added Tax , or consumption tax . 
504	164	TAX 's much more fair than the BS WE deal with now , and means more people pay a fair tax burden . 
505	164	TAX 's also easier to track than trying to keep a history on every american 's income , since TAX 's collected at the business level at the time of sale . 
506	164	ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ only have to track the businesses , so it essentially means the end of the IRS as WE know END . 
507	164	I 'd love to see a major reduction in the IRS I , is n't that smaller government ? 
508	164	This I have n't looked at a great deal , but Bush did n't exactly spend alot of time trying to secure WE borders either ... in fact as I recall Bush wanted to give em amnesty ... so at worst WE 're no worse off than before . 
509	164	Cap and Trade is a good idea , and if CAP gets WE as a country off of Oil , and using renewable energy , we as a country will be way ahead of the rest of the world , and be able to laugh when the oil runs out . 
510	164	Because some day , DAY certainly will , and I for one would rather have a renewable form of energy ready sooner rather than later . 
511	165	-RRB- -RRB- -RRB- Well , we do have a $ trillion dollars worth of wars to contend with every year -LRB- WE should count the wars as off-budget items like Bush did -RRB- . 
512	165	And an annual $ trillion dollar defense budget . 
513	165	Not to mention the huge hole in the budget Bush left behind by BUSH tax cuts , which , last I heard , has cost the Treasury $ 2.6 trillion dollars . 
514	165	And the bank failures . 
515	165	And the export of most of our major tax revenue-producing industries . 
516	165	Did I mention that Depressions are expensive ? 
517	165	Like some brie with that whine ? 
518	166	O please ASPECT_PHOEBE_BUMP_ fail at ASPECT_PHOEBE_BUMP_ attempt at trying to be and sound like an elitist also . 
519	166	His spending of control . 
520	166	Worse by far then any other president ... Socialism costs a lot of other peoples money , so HIS can keep spending ... LOL 
521	167	Most likely . 
522	167	HE has kept most of HE campaign promises . 
523	167	HE has been more transparent . 
524	167	HE has\/will raise taxes on everyone -LRB- no tax cut for 95 % of Americans -RRB- , which is desparately needed . 
525	167	HE has increased spending\/size of government to record levels , and saved us from another great depression . 
526	167	He has \/ will increase US deficit to record levels , and saved US from another great depression . 
527	167	HE pushes through legislation HE promised to do and was voted in for . 
528	167	HE has strengthened America 's position in the international community , and reversed a new cold war . 
529	167	HE has several proposed policies that will help Americans and US economy . 
530	167	HE is welcomed by US allies and isolating US enemies . 
531	167	HE is continuously lied about by the conservative media . 
532	167	ECONOMY depends on who is run against HE , but the Obama administration has been a big positive change for America . 
533	169	McVeigh was a nut job . 
534	169	Every group has them . 
535	169	For the most part , Tea Party folks are average everyday folks that are sick and tired of big bureaucracy , big government , government waste , and ever-increasing taxes . 
536	169	There are racist people in all groups , but to call the Tea Party movement racist or violent , just exhibits ignorance . 
537	170	News Flash : It does n't matter who is President now . 
538	170	Things are bad , and they are not headed in the right direction . 
539	170	Economic recovery and job creation comes from the private sector , not the government . 
540	170	Economic recovery would happen if RECOVERY were not for our government getting in the way . 
541	171	I do not idolize Palin . 
542	171	I like her . 
543	171	I believe that I have told ASPECT_MERTEX_ in another thread a while back , that I really hope that HER does not run . 
544	171	I think there are better candidates out there . 
545	171	I just hope that HER continues to be a pain in the butt for the left , and spreads the word about CANDIDATES that the MSM does not like to . 
546	172	The funny thing is that many folks knew that Obama was n't Presidential material , and now OBAMA has proved that OBAMA is not Presidential material , yet ASPECT_MERTEX_ drones still follow OBAMA like sheep heading toward a cliff . 
547	173	Well , we all have skewed opinions , otherwise WE would be brain dead . 
548	174	The stimulus was a failure and full of earmarks . 
549	174	Invest in creating a record deficit , with little to show for DEFICIT . 
550	174	The problem is that the VAT , if implemented , would be an additional tax , and not replace anything . 
551	174	Bush , McCain , and Obama support amnesty . 
552	174	The fact remains that Obama has gone backward on enforcement . 
553	174	We all know that WE need alternative forms of energy . 
554	174	Cap & Trade is nothing but a tax on corporations that will trickle down to goods and services , because everything takes energy to produce , transport , etc. . 
555	175	I do n't know whether to laugh at this as a joke or cry at this because of how ignorant and misinformed ASPECT_IRIEMON_ are . 
556	176	Funny , I had the same reaction reading ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ OP . 
557	177	It appears he does n't worship at the altar of Beck . 
558	177	Do ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ think viewing Glenn Beck should be mandatory ? 
559	178	make that 2 of us . 
560	179	Of course , ASPECT_JUSTONEMOREVOICE_ liberals . 
561	180	I think liberals could learn alot from guys like Beck . 
562	180	LIBERALS should listen to talk radio . 
563	181	Of course . 
564	181	ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ 're a conservative . 
565	183	Ostap Bender , who are BENDER going to vote for in the 2012 elections ? 
566	183	Oh that right - ASPECT_OSTAP_BENDER_ CANT VOTE IN THIS COUNTRY ! 
567	184	yes , and i also know the term correct word is ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ 're . 
568	184	silly conservatives never get that correct . 
569	186	ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ 've got to be kidding . 
570	186	Old Liar Beck . 
571	186	That figures , most conservatives are so used to lies , CONSERVATIVES think CONSERVATIVES are great ! 
572	186	Of course , OLD could be attributed to not remembering , but there are so many instances where BECK has been caught lying , I think BECK is just used to OLD . 
573	186	YouTube - Glenn Beck Caught Lying and Smearing ... 
574	187	Conservatives hit ASPECT_MIDIPOUR_ with CONSERVATIVES ! 
576	188	I 'm just happy with all the freebies and want to elect Obama for life . 
577	188	Let someone else pay for I stuff . 
578	189	More like let 's slaughter the middle class and steepen the rates for corporate accounts , because clearly the simple folks and illegal immigrants deserve 'S . 
579	190	ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ have got to be -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- ing kidding me glen beck ... verry sad day when people are basing thier political views on ideals that come from the mind of an off the wall person like glen beck . 
580	190	the majority of fox new is so biased that BE isnt even worth watching . 
581	190	if ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ want fair and balanced ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ only option nowa days is cnn . 
582	190	ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ really think that if times were better people like glen beck would have been able to capitalize on the american peoples anger toward the government ??? 
583	190	anyone who says that race is not a factor driving the obama hatred tell do WE think thing would be better with mccain as president would the economy be doing so much better would jobs suddenly be sky rocketing ?? 
584	190	what more could mccain be doin to help improve these things ??? 
585	190	yes we would have smaller gov. . 
586	190	and less gov spending but how does tha go to fixxing job loss and the economy ??? 
587	190	as for those who -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- about obama raising taxes let ME ask did ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ recive a bigger return in prior years ??? 
588	190	and if ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ so against obamas so called tax cuts give back any additional money ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ have gained through OBAMAS and lets see how many takers we get on that im guessing non im sure ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ all are more than happy to keep the coin but by all means keep bad mouthing a guy who has inherited a complete cluster -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- that took 8 years to do and ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ people have only given 15 months to fix so lets all vote GUY out why dont WE 
589	192	Is Kenia in Hawaii ? 
590	194	Did ASPECT_MIDIPOUR_ hear that on the Glenn Beck Show or was THAT telegraphed from Mars ? 
591	194	Seriously , THAT 's nice to have an opinion on the matter , so if ASPECT_MIDIPOUR_ said ASPECT_MIDIPOUR_ thought BECK was unfit , then fine . 
592	194	OTOH , when ASPECT_MIDIPOUR_ say `` most of ASPECT_MIDIPOUR_ agree '' , THAT would be proper to provide the basis of ASPECT_MIDIPOUR_ conclusion such as facts . 
593	194	Are ASPECT_MIDIPOUR_ basing this on scientifically verifiable polling data ? 
594	194	A news article ? 
595	194	Glenn Beck 's tears ? 
596	194	`` most of ASPECT_MIDIPOUR_ '' want to know . 
597	195	Not that I was basing I on statistic , just look up , and ASPECT_DIVINE_WIND_ 'll understand what I meant by us . 
598	196	The poll question was `` Will ASPECT_MIDIPOUR_ vote for Obama in 2012 ? '' 
599	196	not `` Is Obama fit to be President '' as ASPECT_MIDIPOUR_ stated . 
600	196	Some could have voted No simply because SOME want to see these hotties in the White House , not because of anyones fitness for the office : 
601	197	ASPECT_DIVINE_WIND_ mean bailin and nojeans ? 
602	198	Awesome picture , ok , I 'll apologize ; I do n't want Obama in office , and I think OBAMA and the socialists should go to Canada . 
603	199	Where they can form a stronger band of socialists ? 
604	199	Maybe THEY 'll go after Rush fulfills his promise of moving to HIS megabuck estate in Costa Rica . 
605	199	Here 's another great campaign poster : 
606	200	Quite a pair , right ? 
607	200	Or is that two pair ? 
608	200	I 'm confused . 
609	200	Back on topic ; if Obama does n't get the economy turned around in the next two years , OBAMA 'll join George H. W. Bush as a one-term President . 
610	202	I do n't think any male soldiers would have any problem standing at attention if they were the C in Cawe c'mon , someone had to say C 
612	203	Even about the Kenyan born part . 
613	203	Michelle Obama spilled the beans on that one when she referred to Kenya as Obama 's home country in a speech . 
614	204	I 'm usually very accurate , but mistakes happen . 
615	204	If that is all ASPECT_JUSTONEMOREVOICE_ have got on conservatives , then I think we 're doing fine . 
616	205	I could sit here all day posting videos of Obama and OBAMA cronies spewing lies . 
617	205	For the most part , conservative radio and many of these conservatives on TV have PART right . 
618	205	We 've got ASPECT_MERTEX_ number . 
619	206	Another liberal drone . 
620	206	Obama fixing the economy ... where ? 
621	206	Obama tax cuts ... where ? 
622	206	Are ASPECT_SANDMONSTER530_ talking about the U.S. ? 
623	207	This is the perception ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ get when ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ sole source of information is the Murdoch propoganda outlets . 
624	208	My questions are legitimate , and MY will be waiting for answers . 
625	209	He happens to love this country more than Obama , ASPECT_RSTONES199_ should keep that in mind ~ ~ ~ ~ 
626	210	What would ASPECT_FLOUNDER_ call an American who loved Germany so much he puts German interests above America 's . 
627	210	I know what I 'd call AMERICAN . 
628	210	Hint ; GERMANY 's a seven-letter word which begins with T. T. 's civilized to respect people even if PEOPLE views are different or opposing , but how can someone respect a txxxxxx even if PEOPLE favor ASPECT_FLOUNDER_ side ? 
629	211	I 'd salute that ! 
630	212	ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ mean ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ are really unaware that the Obama stimulus package included over $ 300 billion in tax cuts , and ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ are really unaware that the economy has gone from a -6 &#37; real annual growth rate to +6 % , job loss have gone from 700,000 losses to gains , the unemployment rate peaked and is now lower , productivity is now growing at 6 % , housing markets have stabilized and the stock markets are up 70 % since March ? 
631	212	ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ really do need to broaden ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ information sources because ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ are obviously not getting relevat information . 
632	212	No wonder ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ have such a negative view of Obama . 
633	212	Those of us who evaluate a broader source of information know better . 
634	213	What makes ASPECT_DIVINE_WIND_ say that ? 
635	214	Yes mertex we all believe ASPECT_MERTEX_ . 
636	214	Everyone here knows that the liberals fear of the tea party movement has nothing to do whatsoever with LIBERALS fear of being elected right out of power . 
637	214	While WE are at MOVEMENT shoveling this load of b.s. that the liberal lefts fear and hatred of the tea party movement has nothing to do whatsoever with LEFTS own fear of loss of political power , why do n't WE sell some bridges or make some money scamming people with a nigeria email chain letter too while WE are at MOVEMENT . 
638	214	After all if ASPECT_MERTEX_ expect LEFTS to believe that the liberal lefts fear of and hate for the tea party movement has nothing to do with politics , ASPECT_MERTEX_ might as well as ASPECT_MERTEX_ clearly expect the folks to beleive anything ASPECT_MERTEX_ tell FOLKS too believe . 
639	214	Too bad for the liberals that the gig is up , the majority of the people see LIBERALS for the power hungry socialists LIBERALS are , and also reject LIBERALS and LIBERALS ideology . 
640	214	Too bad LIBERALS 're on the way out this November . 
641	214	-LRB- By the way , the Dems lost badly here in Ohio in early provisonal voting . -RRB- 
642	214	Ut oh ... 
643	215	Yeah I agree , I do n't get it all those things have been discussed to death , ONES are the most obvious ones . 
644	215	In fact some of those the libs applaud ... LOL . 
646	216	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ go to one source , others go to others . 
647	216	Just seems like ASPECT_IRIEMON_ pay attention to the optimistic side . 
648	216	Great point ASPECT_IRIEMON_ made there . 
649	216	And , I dont think anyone is worried RIGHT NOW . 
650	216	We are worried about the country 's future . 
651	216	I dont care if job growth has happened over the last two months when they are passing legislation that will lay stagnant for the next few years . 
652	216	How does the government go about spending MORE tax money while providing MORE tax cuts ? 
653	216	Fact : Obama 's 1st term increased the national debt 4x more than Bush 's worst term . 
654	216	Not to let bush off the line , but did someone forget ? 
655	216	They are using tax money to pay back the barrowed money + Interest ? 
656	216	The point is , providing tax cuts while spending more is just another way to try to trick the economy into getting better . 
657	216	What the skeptics think is that when those tax breaks turn into tax increases -LRB- which POINT will , or the government will default -RRB- , thats when -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- hits the fan . 
658	216	Stop thinking in the now god d \* mn STOP . 
659	216	Not many successful business men thinks short term . 
660	217	I am so tired of hearing about these tax cuts that the Obama has blessed us all with . 
661	217	Yet never seeing a liberal anywhere who can point to the precise tax code , precise item , or precise individual to which said `` cuts '' apply . 
662	217	So by all means , if such `` cuts '' do exist , show US where . 
663	217	Post some links . 
664	217	Show US all where and what precisely these so called tax cuts were ? 
665	217	Which tax codes did these `` cuts '' address . 
666	217	Who did THESE cut taxation for ? 
667	217	What goods did THESE cut taxation on ? 
668	217	By what percent did THESE lower the rate of taxation ? 
669	217	Simply declaring that Obama 's so called stimulus cut taxation , does not make TAXATION so . 
670	217	Just as simply declaring that Obama 's so called stimulus turned the economy around and brought us out of recession did n't make STIMULUS so either . 
671	217	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ see liberals , LIBERALS al know for a fact that the so called stimulus bill , increased taxation on the poorest Americans . 
672	217	Because AL increased taxation on tobacco and alcohol . 
673	217	And well , well , well , guess who just happens to drink and smoke the most in this nation . 
674	217	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ got GUESS , the poorest Americans . 
675	217	So where are these `` cuts '' at Ireimon . 
676	217	Oh and if ASPECT_IRIEMON_ happen to be referring to the `` cuts '' he and HE demophony cronies in Congress plan to make to Medicaid and Medicare . 
677	217	Those are not tax cuts , those are robbing the poorest Americans , to give to the richest , and are not in the so called `` stimulus '' either but rather were in the liberals healthcare dictate otherwise known as tyrantcare . 
678	218	WHO IS THEY ? 
679	218	TELL ME !! 
680	218	, why do ASPECT_MERTEX_ constantly lump all people together , , why ? 
681	218	Dont ASPECT_MERTEX_ understand DONT makes ASPECT_MERTEX_ wrong automatically ? 
683	219	Now now in all fairness there has been job growth . 
684	219	The problem is however , that for every job created , two others went away . 
685	219	This administration , and ADMINISTRATION 's liberal supporters however always want to point to the job growth in this or that economic sector , as for example SUPPORTERS do inm pointing to the creation of Government jobs , due to the workers ADMINISTRATION 's hired for the census . 
686	219	Yet do so , all the while ignoring the fact that in other sectors of the economy there was a net loss in jobs , and those jobs which YET created , are not permanent jobs but rather are temporary and YET will go away later this year too . 
687	219	How hypocritical of the left to lecture everyone about looking at the `` broader picture '' when YET so excel at cherry picking the data which suits YET . 
688	221	Flounder is n't it interesting that all the while telling us all about how US need to run around `` fearing '' the Tea party movement , because of their hatred and violence . 
689	221	And not because the movement stands a real chance of kicking these liberals out of political power . 
690	221	These libtards LIBTARDS resort to the use of hateful , sexualy , explicit denigrating , derogatory , terminology as `` tea bagger '' . 
691	221	USE does not get much more hypocritical than that ladies and gents , than for the liberals to lecture everyone about `` tone '' and `` respectful discourse '' all the while labeling LADIES political opposition with such deragatory terms as `` tea bagger '' and slandering the movement with false , unsubstantiated , unspported by fact , assertions of violence . 
692	221	Especially given that time and time again , in incident after incident , TIME 's been the leftists who become\/became violent while protesting . 
693	221	Infact , during the entire term of former President Bush , these same liberals who are now so worried about violence , defended such things as assault and violence comitted by fellow liberals , in incidents such as throwing pies , vandalism to private property saying such actions comitted by these leftists , in LIBERALS name , for LIBERALS `` cause '' was defended as `` free speech '' and `` patriotism '' . 
694	221	And that 's not even taking into account , LIBERALS attempted defense of the recent attack on persons leaving a republican fundraiser , by attempting to outright lie concerning the facts of the case . 
695	221	Claiming first that it was not liberals who were there protesting which comitted the attack , and then falsely claiming that the attack was not politically motivated , eventhough the New Orleans police Department say 's ATTACK was . 
696	221	See once again , we are all supposed to ignore the fact that FACT 's by far , more often than not , these leftists who become violent in the face of opposition to LEFTISTS ideology . 
697	221	So the liberals can pretend that VICTIMS 're just the poor misunderstood victims . 
698	223	ASPECT_SEC_ sound like the rest of the comatose conservatives , that listen to Faux News . 
699	223	CONSERVATIVES never get REST right , CONSERVATIVES just repeat the BS CONSERVATIVES hear on that stations trying to pose as a news station . 
700	223	What freebies are CONSERVATIVES getting , anyway ? 
701	224	But they would n't be true . 
702	224	THEY would be made up by Faux News to fool NEWS viewers . 
703	224	If THEY had NEWS right , THEY would n't have lost . 
704	224	But , sooner or later NEWS is going to hit home , NEWS might take a couple more losses , that Kool Aid has long lasting effects . 
705	225	ASPECT_ANTIX_ `` fact '' is wrong . 
707	226	AGREED 's how I vote ; I consider the field of candidates , CANDIDATES past accomplishments , the issues at stake and the best interests of the country before voting . 
708	226	We 're two and half years out from the election , TWO 's a little early to be deciding ... unless EXTREMIST 're a rabid extremist who will vote for or against someone based upon a skewed political agenda . 
709	226	Then , by all means , go right ahead and rant from ASPECT_WAFFLESFTW_ soapboxes in the park . 
710	227	The tax cuts will be wiped out with future tax increases . 
711	227	He has already signed for 640 billion in tax increases . 
712	227	Many of the jobs supposedly gained are temporary jobs such as census worker jobs , and many are government jobs . 
713	227	Economic recover happens from the private sector , not the government . 
714	227	There is talk of the second wave of foreclosures and more unemployment . 
715	227	Do n't buy into the false numbers Obama likes to throw around . 
716	228	Such a childish and baseless reply . 
717	228	If they are wrong , why does conservative radio and TV have the highest ratings in the country ? 
719	230	Bush is even more reasonable for tax hikes needed in the future than Obama . 
720	230	Prescription drug plan BUSH did n't even attempt to pay for FUTURE , Obama atleast has tried . 
721	230	Everyone says cuts to medicare and reducing subsidies for cadillac plans will be repealled , that may be true in today 's politics , by 2018 the debt will be so huge China may no longer be buying CHINA . 
722	230	At that point cuts will have to happen . 
723	230	Bush got into Iraq which has cost a ton of money . 
724	230	Iraq was optional , Afghanistan was n't . 
725	230	Bush 's second tax cut was while the debt was getting really big and the US was already in 2 wars , the first tax cut was perfectly fine . 
726	231	Now that ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ 've been informed about the status of Obama 's tax cuts and economic performance , apparently for the first time , do ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ really believe that GDP , productivity , unemployment and the like are numbers Obama created ? 
727	231	Now who told ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ that ? 
731	232	He does own the economy . 
732	232	The blaming Bush game is over . 
733	233	Of course , it 's Bush 's fault , and always will be to ASPECT_DAVE2888_ liberals . 
734	234	Presidents are generally over-credited as to the economy by folks who lack comprehension . 
735	234	But I 'll add ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ statement to the list of others who credit Obama for how the economy is doing now . 
736	234	STATEMENT portends well for Obama in the future . 
737	235	Im not a liberal , I am a fiscal conservative . 
738	235	IF someone does actions that cause long-term debt IM that person fault if tough measures have to happen to correct the path that person help set . 
739	236	ASPECT_DAVE2888_ are using the old fashioned , pre 1981 meaning of the word `` conservative '' . 
740	236	Back then MEANING meant ASPECT_DAVE2888_ believed the budget should be balanced , even if ASPECT_DAVE2888_ had to raise taxes to do BUDGET . 
741	236	To today 's conservative , `` fiscal conservative '' means ASPECT_DAVE2888_ cut taxes and borrow the difference . 
742	236	ASPECT_DAVE2888_ terminology is just confusing to modern conservatives . 
743	238	No , No , No. ... he 's not worth it . 
744	238	I am glad the majority of this poll said `` No '' . 
745	238	HE is too unpredictable for I tastes . 
746	238	Just when ASPECT_4HORSEMEN_ think HE is going to show bipartin efforts , HE let 's us down most of the time . 
747	238	I will definitely work hard at campaigning for Palin if 'S runs . 
748	238	I detest the man and all that MAN stands for . 
749	238	I try to see the good MAN does for US country but MAN vanity and self righteousness turns I off . 
750	239	Complete with a Jack Daniel chaser ?? 
752	240	Nope , I 'm just a conservative who can barely dress himself each day . 
753	240	I thoughts are so out of whack that I brain barely functions . 
754	240	I lived in MA and used to vote Democrat . 
755	240	I moved to NH , was raising a family , attending `` town meeting '' many times in I small town and learned fiscal responsibility in govt and I then realized that common sense , and conservative fiscal policy belongs in govt . 
756	240	I was hooked to conservatism and have never changed 
757	241	Oh it 's great . 
758	241	Unemployment hovering at 9.7 % nationwide . 
759	241	Over 12 % in California . 
760	241	If ASPECT_IRIEMON_ factor in folks who are no longer able to receive unemployment benefits , and those working temporary jobs , Underemployment\/unemployment is way high . 
761	241	Foreclosures still happening . 
762	241	Great economy . 
763	241	Thanks Obama ! 
764	242	I 'm fairly conservative I , but I do n't like how the Republican party lies . 
765	242	They are not really conservative , so why buy into THEY lies . 
766	242	Besides , THEY are way too greedy for I . 
767	242	It is n't so much about being conservative , but more about not wanting to help the under-privileged . 
768	242	I could never be like that . 
769	242	I lived in NH , also , in Bedford , worked in MA . 
770	242	NH was funny , the people of NH did n't like the people in Mass because PEOPLE came up to use PEOPLE ski resorts and vacation in NH , and the people in Mass did n't like the people of NH because PEOPLE came to Mass and took all the jobs ! 
771	242	Pretty funny . 
772	242	I lived in NH because Mass was way too expensive , beautiful country but too -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- cold for I . 
773	243	Thank Bush , BOZO is the Bozo that did it . 
774	243	ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ keep blaming Obama , but everyone knows it was Bush that tanked the country . 
775	243	Only the very limited in ability to decipher the truth blame Obama for what their party did . 
776	243	THE is getting pretty darn old . 
777	243	Take responsibility for ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ party 's mistakes and inabilities instead of repeating the lies . 
778	243	The country knew better Nov 2008 , what makes ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ think THEIR 've forgotten ? 
779	245	By whose measure ? 
780	245	Don t be sucked in by public polls . 
781	245	They can change quickly either way as President G. H. W. Bush found out in 1992 . 
782	245	A year can make a huge difference . 
783	245	Obama still has 2.5 years to find OBAMA footing . 
784	245	Time will tell . 
785	245	Who do ASPECT_DWARE_ like for running against OBAMA ? 
786	247	It just proves one thing as far as I am concerned , the American people had no problem electing a black President . 
787	247	IT 's Obama and OBAMA ideas that fell short , and IT can not be blamed on racism . 
788	248	Bush had some spending issues , and BUSH unfortunately , had some bailouts of BUSH own , but Obama took spending\/deficit creation to a whole new level . 
789	248	BUSH increased the size of government like nobody else . 
790	248	Economic recovery happens from the private sector , not the government . 
791	248	ASPECT_MERTEX_ should know that . 
792	249	Well then , I guess the next guy has his\/her work cut out for them . 
793	250	Palin and Obama are n't apples to apples comparison . 
794	250	So , yes , Palin is not worthy of consideration . 
795	251	Palin 's retarded son would be a step up as President than what we have now , Bobo , the Post Turtle . 
796	251	Hell , SON ` ld vote for a three day old dog turd vice , Bobo , the Post Turtle . 
797	253	She cant get SHE to agree with that . 
798	253	Since Government jobs guarantees minority hiring that 's the only way to recovery for SHE . 
799	253	The prosperity and growth of America means nothing , just like Obama . 
800	254	ASPECT_OPENSCANDAL_ are correct , Palin was ten times more qualified for the presidency than Obama . 
801	254	TEN simply unfair to lower her to OBAMA level of incompetence and idiocy . 
802	255	Doubtful ... but I bet she looks a lot hotter in a bikini . 
803	256	Ok , maybe a little overzealous , at least 9.4 times more qualified . 
804	256	I really do n't want either of those images in I head , please stop ! 
805	258	We already know what conservatives vote for and consider `` intelligent '' - Bush , Palin , Quayle , so , no wonder ASPECT_A777PILOT_ would think Palin 's son would be a step up ! 
806	258	Obama is nowhere near the bottom of the `` dumb '' pile along with ASPECT_A777PILOT_ group - enjoy ASPECT_A777PILOT_ sour grapes ! 
807	259	Bush 41 I liked . 
808	259	Bush 43 , not so much . 
809	259	Palin I like . 
810	259	Quayle , I do n't like ... and there is no one , not even jimmy the carter , that has been a worse President than Bobo , the Post Turtle . 
811	260	Leadership is n't a test score . 
812	260	SCORE a number of attributes , sadly many that Obama lacks . 
813	260	The president is supposed to be a leader , not a whiny appologist . 
814	260	We can certainly see now what liberal ` intelligence ' is getting WE , and most people simply do n't like NOW . 
815	260	Only the Obamabots seem to treasure OBAMABOTS ` intelligence ' . 
816	260	Has OBAMABOTS released OBAMABOTS transcripts yet ? 
817	260	Just for comparison purposes . 
818	261	Not quite as chlldish and baseless as the repeated mantra of the `` so-called conservatives '' . 
819	261	Everything about Faux News is a farce . 
820	261	First of all , CONSERVATIVES ratings only include most viewers for one `` Cable '' station . 
821	261	Add all the other cable stations together , plus ABC , NBC , and CBS , and Faux News comes out short . 
822	261	Liberals are not glued to MSNBC - the only station that compares to Faux news in NEWS biased broadcasting , as conservatives are to Faux News . 
823	261	So much for ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ ratings ! 
824	261	Live + Same Day Cable News Daily Ratings for April 21 , 2010P2 + Total DayFNC 1,149,000 viewersCNN 418,000 viewersMSNBC 414,000 viewersCNBC 187,000 viewersHLN 335,000 viewersSome of ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ more reputable leaders are giving ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ good advice , ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ should listen to LEADERS . 
825	261	Have Republicans Been Out-Foxed ? 
826	261	Some conservatives are beginning to question whether Fox News is good for CONSERVATIVES movement . 
827	261	By Eve Conant | Newsweek Web ExclusiveApr 13 , 2010GOP Sen. Tom Coburn scored a perfect 100 on the American Conservative Union 's rankings for lawmakers last year . 
828	261	That makes EXCLUSIVEAPR one of the last people ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ 'd expect to criticize what liberals see as the GOP 's most notable media mouthpiece , Fox News , but that 's exactly what EXCLUSIVEAPR did at a recent town-hall meeting in Oklahoma . 
829	261	When an audience member fretted about going to prison for not buying health insurance , Coburn responded , `` The intention is not to put anyone in jail . 
830	261	That makes for good TV on Fox , but that is n't the intention . '' 
831	261	When discussing disagreements with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , MEMBER described PELOSI as a '' nice lady '' and warned the jeering crowd to be civil and to get A news from more than one source : `` Do n't catch ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ being biased by Fox News that somebody is no good . 
833	263	Mertex only ASPECT_MERTEX_ would add up all the other stations to try to beat Fox , , HAHAHAHAHA . 
834	263	That 's like saying Michal Jackson was never number one , because if ASPECT_MERTEX_ add up ALL the other singers their records out sold MERTEX ... LOLOnly ASPECT_MERTEX_ ... . 
835	265	Hey , but Mertex thinks that if ASPECT_A777PILOT_ do n't like Obama , ASPECT_A777PILOT_ must have been sucking Bush 's ying yang . 
836	265	That 's not the case . 
837	265	Many of us had problems with past Republicans , however , Obama makes MANY look better every day . 
839	266	That 's why more and more folks are leaning conservative . 
840	266	Adding the others together , and comparing OTHERS to FOX as a whole , is not apples to apples . 
841	266	Quit scraping the bottom of the barrel . 
842	267	Albeit a VERY subjective argument , I 'm almost afraid to ask ... How did ASPECT_DISPONDENT_ come to that conclusion ? 
843	267	-LRB- Please do n't just repeat the talking points of ASPECT_DISPONDENT_ ` politician du jour ' -RRB- 
844	268	For starters their governmental experience . 
845	268	Governor of a state , any state requires one to learn the necessary skills to deal with a far greater scope of issues , and do so in the executive role . 
846	268	BELIEVER do not feel Senators make good candidates nor good presidents . 
847	268	It was a great disappointment to BELIEVER to see McCain and Obama as the candidates . 
848	268	BELIEVER am a very strong believer that executive experience is essential to good presidential candidates -LRB- and no Mayor does n't qualify , BELIEVER dispised the concept of Guilani even running -RRB- . 
849	268	BELIEVER personally feel that assessment is dead on with Obama , likewise BELIEVER think McCain would have been a weak president . 
850	268	Secondly after Bush , Congress was going to grab CANDIDATES balls back , which CANDIDATES promptly did . 
851	268	This merely indicated that whoever the president would be would not enjoy the precieved executive powers Bush had . 
852	268	For years CANDIDATES seemed to forget who CANDIDATES were and acted as the executive 's ATM machine , both sides contributed to that , both are accountable . 
853	268	Couple that with a president without executive experience and ASPECT_OPENSCANDAL_ simply creating an even weaker executive . 
854	268	An experienced executive , even from a small state , would better know how to deal with the legistature as a separate entity . 
855	268	An experienced executive would also not allow CREATING to be steamrolled by Congress , which it appears has happened to Obama since day one . 
856	268	CONGRESS does n't help that the Congressional majority is EXECUTIVE own party , EXECUTIVE only has so much room to put EXECUTIVE foot down before EXECUTIVE causes in-fighting . 
857	268	Therefore BELIEVER conclusion is that Palin was indeed , after careful adjustment 9.4 times more qualified to be president than Obama . 
858	269	May I suggest , she is through the bottom and is shoveling pure chit !! 
861	271	ASPECT_RONMATT_ see ASPECT_RONMATT_ holding back again Ron , I thought we have spoken about this before . 
863	273	Dow Jones has been climbing steadily.Real-Time News Dow , up 70 ... S&P , up 9 . 
865	273	NASDAQ , up 11 By Associated Press business staff April 23 , 2010 , 4:15 PM Updated at 5:50 p.m. Unemployment is recovering . 
866	273	GDP kept climbing at end of 2009Health Care access to millionsAll this in 18 months - more than Bush did in 8 years ! 
867	273	I do n't think ASPECT_A777PILOT_ assessment of Obama is accurate . 
868	273	ASPECT_A777PILOT_ may like Palin , but 18 is not qualified to be President , not now , not ever . 
870	274	Ten key strokes . 
871	276	I 've asked many questions . 
872	276	Which one are ASPECT_FARRA_ answering ? 
873	276	But , thank ASPECT_FARRA_ for answering . 
874	276	That does n't happen often on this site . 
875	278	Obviously not adept at math . 
876	278	ASPECT_A777PILOT_ assessment of Obama is no more than the echo of Faux News and Rush Limbaugh . 
877	278	The Republicans in Congress are more dangerous to the nation . 
878	278	April 26 , 2010Younger American voters are less enthusiastic about voting in this year 's midterm elections than those who are older . 
879	278	At the same time , 18 - to 29-year-old voters currently favor the Democratic candidate in VOTERS districts by a 12-point margin over the Republican candidate . 
880	278	I did n't know George Bush was Sarah Palin 's son ! 
882	278	Sarah Palin needs to stick to trying to be President of the PTA . 
883	278	That is about BWAHAHA caliber . 
885	279	ASPECT_ALHWRD_ statements sound like those from a well rehearsed robot\/sheeple of the conservative ilk . 
886	279	Anyone that would vote for Palin is in the same category as Palin , uninformed and unintelligent . 
887	279	It is a good thing that 17 year olds can not vote , from ASPECT_ALHWRD_ statements , it is apparent that most 17 year olds are not able to make intelligent choices . 
888	280	Looks like ASPECT_MERTEX_ in the `` minority '' bubba . 
890	280	Obama is crashing and burning . 
892	281	Another `` news flash '' from the `` fair and balanced '' ? 
894	282	ASPECT_MERTEX_ dont need to watch anything , just look up at this poll alone , pretty obvious is n't ? 
895	282	82 to 52 . 
897	283	Liberals ca n't help the poor Republicans\/conservatives who only have one station LIBERALS can trust , because STATION tells LIBERALS what LIBERALS like to hear , whether true or not . 
898	283	So what does REPUBLICANS\/CONSERVATIVES mean that Fox News has more viewers than the other cable News stations ? 
899	283	That all Republicans\/conservatives are tuned into REPUBLICANS\/CONSERVATIVES ? 
900	283	That there are more Republicans\/Conservatives than Liberals and Independents ? 
901	283	That ASPECT_FLOUNDER_ are going to win the next election ? 
902	283	Ha , ha is right - nothing . 
903	283	ASPECT_FLOUNDER_ analogy does n't even make sense , but then , most of ASPECT_FLOUNDER_ posts , do n't . 
904	284	Where did ASPECT_DWARE_ poll come from , WND ? 
906	284	Polling group 's most recent poll for President Barack Obama : Polling Group -LRB- Reverse Chronologically -RRB- USA Today\/Gallup Date April 24-26 , 2010Approval 51 % Disapproval 42 % 
907	285	ASPECT_DWARE_ are actually citing a PF poll as evidence of the general populace ? 
908	285	Good Lord . 
909	285	No wonder our country is in the shape WONDER 's in . 
910	286	I guess that 's why Obama beats both Palin and Romney in the polls ? 
912	288	I think we can give that prediction all the weight due ASPECT_PROFESSOR_PEABODY_ last prediction that GDP in 4th Q 2009 would be negative . 
913	289	Well , Obama did say OBAMA would rather be a good one-term President that a mediocre two-term President . 
914	289	OBAMA 's not doing good this first term , so OBAMA better take OBAMA own advice and skip the second . 
915	290	Iriemon is right ! 
916	290	People that post here are actually paying attention to politics so unless PEOPLE believe in socialism , welfare , racist programs like Affirmative Action , taking no responsibility for ASPECT_IRIEMON_ own actions , or redistribution of wealth PEOPLE wont be voting for Obombya . 
917	290	The best thing the conservatives can do to rid CONSERVATIVES of this moron is to educate the masses . 
918	290	For example 2 of my best friends and staunch conservatives are always dismayed by FRIENDS parents votes , FRIENDS always vote Democratic because that s the way FRIENDS always voted and FRIENDS just don t pay attention any more . 
919	290	FRIENDS both attribute FRIENDS beliefs and ideologies to FRIENDS parents so at heart FRIENDS parents are even more conservative then FRIENDS are and have taught FRIENDS well , FRIENDS just ca n't get FRIENDS parents to realize that the Dems have been hijacked by the loony tune left . 
920	290	Like the fact that the overwhelming majority of Jewish families vote Democratic . 
921	290	Educate ASPECT_IRIEMON_ neighbors Conservatives and all will be well ! 
922	291	I wish that more of the general public would open their eyes and start to pay attention . 
923	291	That way we could end this catastrophe this year and in 2012 . 
924	292	Yep , because look how dandy things went with the last few presidents the conservatives educated us to vote for . 
925	293	Just to show how senseless conservatives are , ASPECT_CICERO1964_ misunderstood Irie 's post . 
926	293	IRIE was actually saying the majority on this Forum are conservatives , and for someone to take the poll seriously , as a legitimate measure of the country 's mood , CONSERVATIVES would have to be demented . 
927	293	Thanks for confirming what IRIE said . 
928	294	Sorry ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ missed it . 
929	294	We did -LRB- open WE eyes -RRB- and WE did -LRB- pay attention -RRB- . 
930	294	That is why WE have a new administration in the White House . 
931	295	Right , except it 's `` he `` Irie = Island slang for alright , as in `` everting be irie `` Mon = man . 
933	296	Thanks for the update - and the lesson in island talk . 
934	296	I knew mon , but never heard of irie - ASPECT_IRIEMON_ post was right on target , too bad the `` right '' is n't clear on the concept . 
935	297	Quite a bit better than the last several presidents that were promoted by liberals . 
936	297	Obama is taking financial irresponsibility to new heights , which does n't seem to concern liberals that cried crocodile tears over Bush spending , even though Obama spends magnitudes more ... Clinton spent most of CLINTON years neutered by a Republican congress , and even so , CLINTON managed to pass a massive tax increase in CLINTON first couple years , after promissing cuts . 
937	297	Carter was abysmal ... just ... AWFUL ... Johnson and Kennedy were no prizes ... Even the worst offensive Republican , Nixon , was far outdone by the offenses of Clinton and REPUBLICAN cronies . 
938	297	Yep ... Those Republican presidents were just awful !!! 
939	298	Sure thing . 
940	298	We can compare Clinton to Reagan any time ASPECT_SIDETRAKD_ want . 
941	298	For the lessers , let 's see how Carter stacked up against either Bush . 
942	298	This will be fun ! 
943	298	Clinton - Record low 3.8 % unemployment , 22 million jobs created , stock markets tripling even after the 2000 correction , a record $ 340 billion deficit inherited turned into a surplus , the longest post war boom on record , 3.9 % per annum real growth , decreasing government jobs . 
944	298	Just off the top of my head . 
945	298	ASPECT_SIDETRAKD_ turn . 
946	299	Despite ultra libs like ASPECT_MERTEX_ , I still do believe that a prosperous and secure America is possible . 
947	302	So so true , how soon some forget , the loss of power has brought out the whiners by the droves . 
948	302	http:\/\/www.hup.harvard.edu\/catalog\/H...l?show=reviews&quot;He argues that a triplet of ` rhetorical ' criticisms -- perversity , futility , and jeopardy -- ` has been unfailingly leveled ' by ` reactionaries ' at each major progressive reform of the past 300 years -- those T. H. Marshall identified with the advancement of civil , political and social rights of citizenship ... Charmingly written , this book can benefit a diverse readership . '' 
949	303	It means that conservatives get out and talk about our concerns . 
950	303	OUR wo n't sit around and let OUR government turn into a socialist government . 
951	303	GOVERNMENT 's amazing how informed most of the liberals are . 
952	303	Just wait till November buddy , NOVEMBER 's the start of the liberal downfall . 
953	303	OUR will not stand for SOCIALIZED healthcare . 
954	303	Obama will NOT be re-elected . 
955	303	OBAMA approval ratings are terrible . 
956	303	Also , lot 's of the people who voted for OBAMA in 2008 -LRB- the lazy people -RRB- , will not get out again in 2012 to vote , PEOPLE will rely on others to do things for PEOPLE ... wait , that sounds like the liberal way of life , that 's because LOT is . 
958	305	That a person who puts another country before their own is a traitor ? 
959	305	I thought COUNTRY was obvious . 
960	308	I voted no because there was no `` Hell no ! '' 
962	309	Not exactly , I mean the person . 
963	309	In what respect does PERSON do that . 
964	309	Thank ASPECT_DIVINE_WIND_ for putting the quote below ... 
965	310	\*\*\* ASPECT_JAVABLACK_ 'll most likely vote for obozo ? 
966	310	Gee , who would have ever guessed ? 
967	310	Notice that ASPECT_JAVABLACK_ did n't give any sound reasons why ASPECT_JAVABLACK_ would vote for bozo , but ASPECT_JAVABLACK_ sure as heck gave a lot of ridculous reasons why ASPECT_JAVABLACK_ would n't support a Republican . 
968	310	Methinks ASPECT_JAVABLACK_ fall into the category of a ` fence sitter ' just waiting for the wind to blow in a favorable direction . 
969	310	But ASPECT_JAVABLACK_ did say one thing that comes as close to a possibility as anything , and that is that bozo may very well get assassinated with the current mood of the nation being as MOOD is , and or REPUBLICAN may very well get impeached or forced to resign in desperation to save what little marxist face REPUBLICAN has left . 
970	312	ASPECT_JTHORP24_ must have been looking at an old Faux News poll . 
971	312	Actually , he is doing much better than conservatives give HE credit for , in spite of the economic mess Bush left the country in when BUSH left office . 
972	312	President Obama s job approval rating improved this week and now stands at 46 percent , up from a record low of 43 percent approval in early April . 
973	312	An equal number of voters disapprove of the job President Obama is doing -LRB- 46 percent -RRB- . 
974	312	And , this is from Faux News , now take a look at a true poll . 
975	312	CNN Poll : Obama approval ratings up Passage of the landmark health care bill appears to have boosted President Barack Obama 's approval rating , but POLL has not affected OBAMA re-election chances so far , according to a new national poll . 
976	312	A CNN\/Opinion Research Corporation survey released Monday indicates that 51 percent of Americans approve of the job Obama is doing in the White House , with 48 percent saying they disapprove . 
977	312	That 51 percent approval rating is up five points from a week ago , before Congress approved the health care reform bill and the president signed the legislation into law . 
978	312	Four in ten respondents say RESPONDENTS disapprove because Obama is too liberal and 6 percent say RESPONDENTS the president is not liberal enough . 
980	313	If ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ consider me an ultra lib , no telling how far off ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ sense of reasoning skills are . 
981	313	ME 'm far from being ultra liberal , ME just do n't like conservatives who claim to be conservative and then practice the complete opposite -LRB- ala G W Bush -RRB- . 
982	313	At least , with a Democrat , ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ are n't expecting an extreme conservative , ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ know what ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ are getting . 
983	313	And , ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ are right , a prosperous and secure America is possible , but not under the Republican administration - CONSERVATIVES lure problems and enemies . 
984	314	Oh , yeah ! 
985	314	ASPECT_MOLONLABE2009_ 'd like that nukelar guy back ! 
986	315	Judging from the comments on ASPECT_JTHORP24_ post , that is all conservatives do , get out and talk ! 
987	315	But , they are so uninformed - and THEY keep believing Faux News that THEY are `` winning '' - wo n't THEY be surprised ! 
988	315	THEY need to tune NEWS to real news instead of believing what Faux News keeps telling THEY . 
989	315	March 29th , 201006:19 PM ETCNN Poll : Obama approval ratings uphttp : \/ \/ news.blogs.cnn.com\/2010\/03\/29...al-ratings-up\/ 
990	316	The fact that I do n't think he 's doing a bad job ? 
991	316	If an incumbent is not doing bad , the only reason to vote for a challenger is if ASPECT_LIBHATER_ think that challenger will do better . 
992	316	Burden is on the challenger , who will most likely be hostile toward I ideology . 
995	316	Tell I ... which office-holder picks the Supreme Court nominees ? 
996	316	How long do those nominees last ? 
997	316	I think people are ridiculous for not considering SCOTUS nominations as an important motivation behind voting . 
998	316	Who is n't ? 
999	316	I lean on one side of the fence , but until I get all the facts , I will not jump off . 
1000	316	SIDE 's foolish to jump before knowing what 's on the ground . 
1001	316	Highly unlikely . 
1002	316	But it is possible any president might leave office before the term is up . 
1003	316	No point in saying what ASPECT_LIBHATER_ 're going to do a couple years from now when ASPECT_LIBHATER_ do n't know who all is going to be involved . 
1004	317	Actually CONTRARY 's quite the contrary . 
1005	317	Conservatives do research and come up with legitimate points . 
1006	317	When the liberals are confronted with this LIBERALS do a few things ... 1 . 
1007	317	LIBERALS say `` that 's not true . '' 
1008	317	LIBERALS deny the fact .2 . 
1009	317	LIBERALS change the subject .3 . 
1010	317	LIBERALS call us racist , sexist , etc. 4 . 
1011	317	LIBERALS blame Bush .5 . 
1012	317	LIBERALS say ASPECT_MERTEX_ are ignorant to get out of an argument . 
1013	318	And since ASPECT_JTHORP24_ did n't refute my CNN poll , MY will assume ASPECT_JTHORP24_ either did n't read POLL or did n't understand POLL . 
1014	318	And ASPECT_JTHORP24_ changed the subject - is that the way Reps\/cons get out of an argument ? 
1015	318	So , where is ASPECT_JTHORP24_ poll saying that Obama 's ratings are going down - do n't post one from back when Reps were making up lies about HCR and getting the whole country to believe those stupid lies - those polls have been replaced now with people that figured out the sky did n't fall after all and the world did n't end , like conservatives promised . 
1016	319	For some reason -LRB- -RRB- Obama does n't have OBAMA health scare program even beginning in earnest for four more years . 
1017	319	Funny , I thought we had such an emergency that OBAMA program could n't be put off even a day more . 
1018	319	That was then , I suppose . 
1019	319	There is news about how the Obama care will actually cost more than promised -LRB- surprised -RRB- and how large corporations are going to end CORPORATIONS having health care for CORPORATIONS employees -LRB- swelling the ranks of those without , and raising costs even more -RRB- . 
1020	319	So if the sky is n't falling , SKY 's because the Obama health care is n't even running yet . 
1021	319	Are ASPECT_MERTEX_ ignorant of the facts , or just disingenuous ? 
1022	324	So in effect when one stays home their unvote went for the candidate that wins . 
1023	324	In ASPECT_SIDETRAKD_ case ASPECT_SIDETRAKD_ helped elect Obama . 
1024	324	If ASPECT_SIDETRAKD_ like what OBAMA 's doing then that 's fine for ASPECT_SIDETRAKD_ , if ASPECT_SIDETRAKD_ do n't -LRB- and apparently ASPECT_SIDETRAKD_ do n't by ASPECT_SIDETRAKD_ above comment -RRB- then ASPECT_SIDETRAKD_ 're part of the problem . 
1025	324	I 'm speaking in general about non-voters . 
1026	324	Each vote is important , many have fought and died for our privilege -LRB- not right -RRB- to vote and every election has consequences as has been and continues to be seen . 
1027	324	I too hope that true statesmen would run for office not the sycophants that OUR 've had to settle for these past many , many years . 
1028	324	I suppose the problem is that there 's so few of the earlier and too many of the latter . 
1029	324	OUR would even recognize a real statemen in this time and day ? 
1030	324	Though I ca n't think of any statesmen at this time , perhaps someone might offer a name or two of such . 
1031	325	Portray it anyway ASPECT_BFOJ_ want to , I could no more stomach the idea of consenting to a McCain presidency than I could to Obama 's . 
1032	325	I made IT very clear to I fellow Republicans before we even got close to the primaries that I would never support OBAMA , and would refuse to vote if they chose to nominate OBAMA . 
1033	325	I would rather see a real liberal Democrat remind Americans of how bad THEY are , than put another RINO in the White House and have the majority of Americans continue to blame WE for what are basically liberal policies . 
1034	325	The differences between Obama and McCain were so minimal to I as to not be worthy of a choice . 
1035	326	Oh yeah , Obama is a world peace-maker and problem-solver ! 
1037	327	ASPECT_BFOJ_ are correct . 
1038	327	Obama got into office with everything but OBAMA credentials , which are non-existent . 
1039	327	The sheeple of America voted for what they perceived to be the next coolest thing from Apple , iPresident , without knowing that is was completely defective . 
1040	328	Buyer 's remorse , anyone . 
1043	329	what was the alternative ? 
1044	330	Not given the alternative . 
1045	331	I 've long been on record as refusing to vote rather than to vote for McCain , but that does n't mean I do n't think that Obama is worse than McCain would have been . 
1046	331	Just various degrees of liberal bad . 
1047	332	Was n't even close , IMO . 
1048	332	McCain would have been an absolute disaster . 
1049	333	Unsupported partisan rhetoric really annoys me . 
1050	333	Is this implying that he should have been able to ? 
1051	333	ME seriously doubt that the majority of Americans would have supported a single-payer health care package . 
1052	333	Is n't the HCR package bad enough ? 
1053	333	ME actually see this as a positive and not a negative . 
1054	333	ME do n't want many of his campaign promises fulfilled . 
1055	333	Not completely but certainly a major improvement over the prior adminstration . 
1056	333	ME do n't think is has a choice on this . 
1057	333	HIS inherited a government that required tax increases because of the deficits which CHOICE created . 
1058	333	Congress has not helped that problem by creating a new trillion entitlement program with the HCR bill . 
1059	333	BTW better to raise taxes than to continue with the deficits . 
1060	333	As has every president in history . 
1061	333	He had a good teacher in the prior adminstration . 
1062	333	This is actually Congress which ignores the People . 
1063	333	The president can only sign or veto legislation . 
1064	333	This is false . 
1065	333	As have all presidents . 
1066	333	False again . 
1067	333	Of note some who are considered as `` Allies '' should n't be . 
1068	333	While selective in his statements , often pulling information from context , this is a common practice for all politicians . 
1069	333	HIS has not blatantly lied anymore than other prior adminstrations . 
1070	333	Did n't vote for Obama or McCain on 2008 because ADMINSTRATIONS were both losers . 
1071	333	ME wo n't vote for Obama in 2012 and seriously doubt that ME will vote for the Republican candidate . 
1072	334	Maybe for Republicans politically . 
1073	334	That 's about the best case ASPECT_IRIEMON_ could make there . 
1074	334	Both of them would have been bad for the country ... But Obama is far , FAR worse than McCain would have been , and that 's saying a lot . 
1075	334	Then again , when someone takes a dump in ASPECT_IRIEMON_ Cheerios , most people are n't going to get a baggie and weigh the size of BAGGIE . 
1076	334	PEOPLE both sucked . 
1077	335	Hey man , do me a favor and do n't rule out that last part yet . 
1078	335	ME still have slim hopes that we can come up with someone decent to run against YET ... 
1079	337	Pretty sure that there were n't any ... 
1080	338	McCain\/Palin , though McCain would have been a rhino which would have meant keeping the status quo which IMHO would have been preferable to what we have now . 
1081	338	Of course WE conservatives would have preferred a candidate more in the line of Ronald Reagan but I do n't see any on the horizon at this time though Sarah Palin comes the closest and I would vote for a woman as well as any other minority , ` cept Obama . 
1082	338	As both sides say `` every election has consequences '' . 
1083	338	And WE now are paying for the consequences of an Obomba administration . 
1084	338	How well does this work ASPECT_IRIEMON_ those who did n't vote ? 
1085	339	If CHOICE was a choice between a Republican liberal and a Democrat liberal , I prefer to let the Democrats take the blame for their liberal . 
1086	339	The country is screwed either way . 
1087	340	What about a Greece Liberal ? 
1088	340	Well , to be fair the Conservative Greece party was just as bad . 
1089	341	The Republicans had Ron Paul who they could have selected to be THEY candidate in 2008 but instead selected an antique who 's political positions were reflective of the Cold War mentality of the 1960 's . 
1090	341	When the Republicans select a presidential candidate who is willing to withdraw the US military from foreign bases and follow the US Constitution which specifically establishes that the federal government is limited to providing `` for the common Defense ... of the United States '' then STATES might pay attention . 
1091	341	As long as the Republican Party supports wars of US imperialism around the world PARTY will not have STATES support , ever . 
1092	342	The lesser of two evils , McCain . 
1093	343	Do n't blame me . 
1094	343	ME actively opposed the McCain nomination , and did everything ME could to convince other Republicans how awful he would be . 
1095	343	Then again , ASPECT_SHIVA_TD_ definition of `` imperialism '' is quite out of whack . 
1096	343	If the U.S. was truly imperialistic , we would outright own half of Europe , and almost all of the Middle East by now . 
1097	344	ASPECT_SHIVA_TD_ 'll get over THING . 
1098	344	ASPECT_SHIVA_TD_ 're right . 
1099	344	THING is a good thing that he has n't made good on most of HE promises . 
1100	344	HE should be very disappointing to HE supporters . 
1101	344	Have ASPECT_SHIVA_TD_ ever heard of cutting spending , reducing waste ? 
1102	344	Obama takes the cake on this , and OBAMA has a few years left to solidify OBAMA top spot . 
1103	344	Which also ignores the wishes of The People . 
1104	344	OBAMA administration has stripped several provisions from the prior Administration which helped control the illegal population . 
1105	344	Luckily , states like Arizona are taking things into PEOPLE own hands , like PEOPLE should . 
1106	344	Once again , Obama takes the booby prize . 
1107	344	Come on . 
1108	344	OBAMA kisses ass . 
1109	344	OBAMA bows to everyone . 
1110	344	OBAMA apologizes for `` evil '' America . 
1111	344	Especially to the Muslims . 
1112	344	How can ASPECT_SHIVA_TD_ say this when ASPECT_SHIVA_TD_ do n't who the Republican candidate is ? 
1113	345	Even my parents , life-long Republicans , found PARENTS were unable to support McCain and PARENTS live in Arizona only a few miles from one of McCain 's homes . 
1114	345	MY often use the term `` imperialism '' to reflect attempts by the US to impose political and economic control over the government of sovereign states and not in the more common definition of literally controlling territory . 
1115	345	If a nation controls the government of a sovereign state NATION effectively controls the territory of that state . 
1116	346	Carter was n't the worst president in US history . 
1117	346	` Expert ' surveys usually put CARTER at the middle of the pack . 
1118	346	Surveys of the general voting public put CARTER at between 11 and 13th best , usually . 
1119	346	The only people who call CARTER the ` worst ' president are partisan hacks on the right . 
1120	346	A -RRB- CARTER 's done a better job of that than most presidents in the last 30 years . 
1121	346	B -RRB- If ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ claim had been true , would n't that have run counter to ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ point about CARTER ` ramming through legislation CARTER wants ' against the will of the people ? 
1122	346	ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ ca n't have CLAIM both ways . 
1123	346	Either CARTER imposes CARTER own preferences over the will of the people , or CARTER graciously sets aside CARTER personal policy preferences when the will of the people becomes clear and does not achieve CARTER campaign promises as a result . 
1124	346	-LRB- quote -RRB- CARTER has not been transparent . 
1125	346	-LRB- quote -RRB- More than any other 21st century president has been . 
1126	346	CARTER has not done so yet , and US 'm not going to let that impact US decision until CARTER does or until CARTER makes serious noises about doing IMPACT . 
1127	346	Aside from that , US think we desperately need to balance the budget , and the way to do that is to increase taxes . 
1128	346	If that means raising taxes for everyone , so be BUDGET . 
1129	346	Every president has done that since ... Carter . 
1130	346	Clinton did more to reduce the scope of government than Reagan or either Bush ever did . 
1131	346	Every president in the last 30 years has presided over record government deficits ... except Clinton . 
1132	346	US have no reason to believe the Fake Conservatives will do any different . 
1133	346	CONSERVATIVES 've demonstrated CONSERVATIVES willingness to push through unpopular legislation many times in the past . 
1134	346	CONSERVATIVES 're certainly proposing an effort to push through a lot of legislation US do n't like , often against the will of the people . 
1135	346	No , NO has n't . 
1136	346	Bush II and Reagan both did way more to weaken American national security than Obama has done . 
1137	346	Overspending on ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ military while engaging in two wars at the same time is not the path to national security . 
1138	346	Earning more enemies than allies is not the path to national security . 
1139	346	Antagonizing enemies whom ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ were not actually at war with is not the path to national security . 
1140	346	Complete speculation . 
1141	346	PATH 's ` shunning ' ENEMIES to insist ENEMIES listen to reason ? 
1142	346	If spewing lies to the American people were a good reason not to vote for someone , we 'd never elect any president . 
1143	346	REASON will depends on who the Republicans put forward for a candidate . 
1144	346	If PEOPLE nominate Sarah Palin or another Fake Conservative , then US probably would vote for Obama again . 
1145	346	None of the Republican candidates currently being floated by the media seem like CANDIDATES 're at all worth voting for . 
1146	347	Several bills have been analyzed on factcheck.com . 
1147	347	In addition to the one that passed , there were two bipartisan bills that never gained traction in congress , both preceding the president 's bill -LRB- formed during that long , unproductive period of time that Obama left congress to make up a bill on their own -RRB- . 
1148	347	Both were pretty similar to Obama 's aside from a few details . 
1149	347	Then there was Boehner 's bill , which is the one considered a `` Republican bill . '' 
1150	347	And , yes , ONE was a joke . 
1151	347	ONE 's method of `` expanding coverage '' was permanent state-administered high-risk pools . 
1152	347	Completely unsustainable . 
1153	347	The rest of ONE was based on deregulation that at best would have driven costs down slightly for people with non-employer-based coverage , but likely also would have decreased the quality of service and instituted a race for the bottom as states compete for insurance company business by adopting the loosest possible regulations . 
1154	348	Everyone has an opinion I suppose . 
1155	348	This is all opinion based on ASPECT_SOMEONE_ part . 
1156	348	Saying he 's more transparent and has done a better job than most is purely without the facts . 
1157	348	ASPECT_SOMEONE_ better get ASPECT_SOMEONE_ facts straight on this one : http:\/\/online.wsj.com\/article\/SB1000...+tax+increases Yeah , and Clinton used bonds sold to cover Social Security as income for the government , thereby off-setting the national debt . 
1158	348	See above . 
1159	348	Obama is also taking deficits and spending to record levels never even fathomed before . 
1160	348	I agree with ASPECT_SOMEONE_ here . 
1161	348	I do n't know about this . 
1162	348	ASPECT_SOMEONE_ can not simply be neutral and do nothing for injustices in the world simply because ASPECT_SOMEONE_ may -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- off someone . 
1163	348	I think Obama looks weak in the eyes of foreign governments . 
1164	348	True , but folks keep voting in the same proven liars . 
1165	348	I may have to write I in on the ballot and vote for I ! 
1166	349	All presidents have done this , not just Clinton . 
1167	349	The total debt , including SS , was decreased $ 116 billion in 2000 . 
1168	350	Should have known , a Rasmussen poll - same as getting a poll from Faux News ! 
1170	351	and Palin being the greater of the 2 evils ticket . 
1171	352	Right ... because who would want to get their polling from the most accurate source . 
1174	353	Liar Liar pants on fire ! 
1175	353	http:\/\/www.treasurydirect.gov\/govt\/r...ebt_histo5.htm09\/30\/2001 5,807,463,412,200.06 09\/30\/2000 5,674,178,209,886.86 09\/30\/1999 5,656,270,901,615.43 09\/30\/1998 5,526,193,008,897.62 09\/30\/1997 5,413,146,011,397.34 09\/30\/1996 5,224,810,939,135.73 09\/29\/1995 4,973,982,900,709.39 09\/30\/1994 4,692,749,910,013.32 Fact is our country went further into debt every single year Clinton was in office ! 
1176	353	JUST THE FACTS FOLKS ! 
1177	354	If I could , yes . 
1178	358	There was mention of a poll on how Americans feels about taxes , but if ASPECT_MERTEX_ read the entire article , ASPECT_MERTEX_ will have found out that Obama has already signed 25 tax increases into law . 
1179	359	Worse than crazy Joe Biden ? 
1180	359	- LOL !!!! 
1181	360	Obama has only been in office for a year and a half . 
1182	360	Wait and see how OBAMA spends\/increases the deficit over the next 2 and a half , and other destructive legislation OBAMA will try to push through . 
1183	361	How much more national destruction do ASPECT_ATHEOS_ need to see ? 
1184	362	Just a female Obama . 
1185	362	No difference whatsoever . 
1186	363	And Obama is a genius right ? 
1187	365	Those took a back seat to his more pressing issues : Countinued open borders ... Ongoing wars ... False recesssion ... Attacking Capitalism . 
1189	365	More wiretapping ... the Sacking of America continues 
1190	366	Magna cum laude graduate from Harvard Law School comes pretty close if not fitting in that definition . 
1191	367	Bought and Paid for . 
1192	368	I 'm waiting for the depression conservatives said we 'd have . 
1193	368	When WE get that I 'll consider it for not supporting Obama . 
1194	369	Ignorant , baseless , nonsense . 
1195	370	Oh I see , But Bush 's MBA from Yale Bush had meant BUSH was an idiot . 
1196	370	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ people are ridiculous ! 
1197	371	But the numbskull Democrats said the same about Bush and SAME was fact ? 
1198	372	I do n't believe Bush graduated cum laude from anything , much less magna cum laude . 
1199	372	Please educate I with a link if I am wrong . 
1200	373	Putting aside the fact that the discussion is about Obama , not Bush , please post a link where I said Bush was an idiot . 
1201	373	Otherwise we can safely accredit ASPECT_WHALER17_ post as another irrelevant and worthless gesture . 
1202	373	Which POST is in any event because this is about Obama , not Bush . 
1203	374	There is such a thing as Insolence thru manner . 
1204	374	If somehow Obama could be put on some ballots as choice for Dog Catcher vs. President , I still could n't . 
1205	374	I mean , I think I heard tell OBAMA kinda got fired when OBAMA worked at Baskin - Robbins . 
1206	374	Imagine that . 
1207	374	The guy could n't even handle scoopin ice cream . 
1208	374	Maybe BASKIN was too physical . 
1209	375	I 've `` heard tell '' all kind of false nonsense about Obama . 
1210	375	Why do ASPECT_FOOLARDI_ believe `` heard tell '' rumors ? 
1211	375	Is it because ASPECT_FOOLARDI_ are simply gullible or a partisan hack willing to credit anything negative about Obama no matter how farfetched or unreliable the source ? 
1212	376	Do n't furgit that Kerry 's team of Terry McAuliffe and Bob Shrum ran around inferring Bush was a dummy . 
1213	376	Then the Yale '' Bones '' bidness came out and both Bush and Kerry were member of that Yale Frat . 
1214	376	So , Kerry hedged some and then finally a Boston Newspaper did what Kerry Promised on - Meet the Press - . 
1215	376	That being to give KERRY entire Service record and Grades , made public . 
1216	376	Kerry dint . 
1217	376	So when THAT came out that Bush had a slightly HIGHER GPA than Kerry . 
1218	376	Obama 's way is bit more Sherlock Holmes . 
1219	376	Obama just had ALL OBAMA educational records put under seal . 
1220	377	I think it highly fair to assume that if Obama was even a Cub Scout and managed just one badge BADGE would be the Bobcat Trail badge -LCB- law of the Pack -RCB- and during the campaign the Oprah Munchhausen woulda kicked-in . 
1221	377	Obama would have been runnin around bragging how OBAMA skipped straight from a lowly Bobcat Trail Badge , right up to asst . 
1222	377	Administrator of the Boy Scouts of Hawaii . 
1223	377	Confirmation made available by appointment only . 
1224	377	Plus lest any'us ` all furgit that Obama was a top scorer for Occidental College , in more than ANY'US Dreams . 
1225	377	If 'n 'N can git the drift . 
1226	378	Whose Oprah Munchhausen ? 
1227	378	DRIFT is a very distant drift . 
1228	379	Since when does book smart mean politically smart ? 
1229	379	Whatever liberals say is fact . 
1230	379	I repeat whatever . 
1231	379	If conservatives say a fact , liberals deny FACT and say that 's not true . 
1232	379	Nobody is correct except liberals . 
1233	379	Who cares ? 
1234	379	Bush is more smarter politically . 
1235	379	That 's all I care about from I president . 
1236	379	Liberals only want a president who LIBERALS think is `` cool . '' 
1237	380	Please ... Take the unfounded , unsourced , biased and false claims elsewhere ... That nonsense only works on uneducated and politically retarded folks . 
1238	380	Not the rest of us ... 
1239	381	Yale means jack -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- ... He was a legacy . 
1240	381	HE got in because HE father went there ... LOL 
1241	382	I said nothing about politically smart . 
1242	382	Disagree with ASPECT_JTHORP24_ opinion . 
1243	383	Perhaps , but since Obama brings up Bush just about everyday I suppose we are at liberty to bring up Bush as well . 
1244	384	Well it 's because everything is Bush 's fault . 
1245	384	Obama has never done anything wrong ... I mean we do live in the Soviet States of Obama . 
1246	385	ASPECT_BFOJ_ can bring up any irrelevant , immaterial things ASPECT_BFOJ_ want . 
1247	385	I 'll point out they are irrelevant and immaterial . 
1248	386	As Obama is irrelevant and immaterial except in the sense of destroying this country . 
1249	386	Off with the blinders , my friend . 
1250	386	Go ahead `` point out '' as ASPECT_IRIEMON_ are led into the pits of hell . 
1251	387	The reason they believe what THEY post . 
1252	388	ASPECT_BFOJ_ post sounds like something spewed out of the mouth of the chief fear monger , Rush Limbaugh . 
1253	388	The sky is falling , the sky is falling ! 
1254	389	A lot closer to one than Failin Palin will ever be ! 
1255	390	But ASPECT_ATHEOS_ 'll suck up all the BS coming out of Obama ? 
1257	391	Palin was neither book smart nor politically smart , yet conservatives think BWAHAHA would be Presidential material ! 
1258	391	Too funny ! 
1259	391	ASPECT_JTHORP24_ finally said something smart . 
1260	391	Yeah , that is why he put the country in the toilet . 
1261	391	And the correct way to say COUNTRY is `` is smarter '' , not `` is more smarter '' . 
1262	391	Must have attended the same school Bush did ? 
1263	391	That 's all ASPECT_JTHORP24_ care about from ASPECT_JTHORP24_ president ? 
1264	391	That PRESIDENT put the country in the toilet ? 
1265	391	That figures . 
1266	392	ASPECT_WHALER17_ tell us ! 
1267	392	First , Mr. Bush never was a strong student . 
1268	392	BUSH transcript at Yale , leaked to The New Yorker , shows that BUSH was a solid C student . 
1269	392	Although a history major , BUSH sampled widely in the social sciences and did poorly in political science and economics while achieving some of BUSH best grades -LRB- the equivalent of a B + -RRB- in philosophy and anthropology . 
1270	392	-LRB- The anthropology class , however , was taught by Margaret Mead that year and was enormously popular because + offered among the easiest grades at Yale . -RRB- 
1271	392	Mr. Bush was not much of a student of politics , for BUSH earned only a 73 in Introduction to the American Political System and a 71 in Introduction to International Relations . 
1272	392	Few , if any , professors seem to have left a mark on BUSH , or BUSH on PROFESSORS . 
1273	392	Several professors who taught BUSH said BUSH had simply been one student in a huge class . 
1274	392	As the historian John Morton Blum put ONE , `` BLUM have n't the foggiest recollection of BUSH . '' 
1275	392	Erich Segal , who later met Mr. Gore at Harvard and based the main character in `` Love Story '' partly on GORE , taught a classical comedy course that Mr. Bush took , but Mr. Segal said SEGAL had no memory of SEGAL . 
1276	392	The transcript indicates that in Mr. Bush 's freshman year , the only year for which rankings were available , BUSH was in the 21st percentile of BUSH class , meaning that four-fifths of the students had better grades than BUSH did . 
1278	393	Where are Obama 's transcripts ? 
1279	394	Oh , I guess ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ do n't believe that he graduated Magna Cum Laude ? 
1280	394	Wikipedia : ObamaHarvard Law School Three-year program Cambridge , Massachusetts J.D. magna cum laude President , Harvard Law ReviewOh , I guess ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ do n't believe Magna Cum Laude 's require a high grade point average ? 
1281	394	HONORS DESIGNATION REQUIRED OVERALL GPASumma cum laude 3.90 Magna cum laude 3.70 Cum laude 3.50 Oh , that figures ! 
1282	395	Wikipedia does not = transcripts . 
1283	396	Palin would be a much better president than Obama . 
1284	396	ASPECT_MERTEX_ liberals ca n't really come up with any legitimate reasons why she would fail . 
1285	396	ASPECT_MERTEX_ just do n't like the way SHE looks , acts , etc. . 
1286	396	If the country was in the toilet when Bush left , COUNTRY 's in the sewer now thanks to Obama . 
1287	396	I would like to know what has gotten better since Obama has been in office ? 
1288	398	Actually , I have to disagree with ASPECT_JTHORP24_ on this one . 
1289	398	I 've heard some liberals upset with Obama for not being liberal enough . 
1290	398	Oddly enough , many of the liberal 's criticisms about Bush were because LIBERAL was TOO liberal on some things ... especially spending . 
1291	398	But logic was never much MANY strong suit ... 
1292	399	And ASPECT_MERTEX_ still think Obama is Presidential material ? 
1294	400	He ordered all federal agencies to find spending cuts and promote transparency , HE reduced the secrecy in executive records , HE restored full adherence to the Freedom of Information Act , HE increased press conferences and town halls , HE blocked lobbyists from accessing the White House or hiring HOUSE staffers , and HE limited White House salaries , saved or created a million direct or indirect jobs with the stimulus program , HE saved the auto industry , the financial industry and the housing market , HE got banks to pay back big buckets of bailout money , HE got the markets up 50 percent in a matter of months , HE turned the corner on monthly unemployment rates , HE stopped the slide in GDP , and HE trimmed the budget deficit by 200 billion a year , gave food and support and health coverage to the unemployed , HE helped people to save PEOPLE mortgages , HE expanded student loans and loan refinancing , HE expanded loans to small businesses , HE established the homeowners credit , and regardless of all the lies spewed by HE enemies , HE cut our taxes . 
1295	400	Along the way HE fixed up neglected roads , bridges and power plants , and funded school construction and internet access , helped round up the crooks who got OUR into all this economic trouble . 
1296	400	HE ended tax breaks for firms that outsource OUR jobs ; HE prevented tax cheats from hiding CROOKS money overseas and finally persuaded Swiss bankers to expose crooked depositors ; HE reformed the credit card industry , HE ended protection of predatory credit card firms , and HE signed the anti-fraud bill , won a Nobel Prize for getting the world back on track , on arms proliferation , the Middle East peace process , relations with the Muslim world , climate change , war crimes , torture , and diplomacy . 
1297	400	HE reengaged with world leaders and the international community , HE improved America s image internationally , HE repaired bilateral relations with dozens of countries , HE persuaded Pakistan to go after the Taliban , HE improved OUR Cuba policy , and HE freed prisoners in North Korea and Myanmar ; showed HE balls by putting more troops in Afghanistan and improving Afghanistan policy ; HE killed the Somali pirates , freed the American captain , and put the Navy in Somali waters ; pulled troops out of Iraq and stopped the stop-loss system , HE got body armor for OUR troops , HE increased pay , benefits , medical care and housing for troops and veterans , HE hired more military spouses ; HE improved conditions at military hospitals , HE stopped the media blackout on war casualties and on the arrival of the coffins at Dover AFB , and HE paid to bring families of soldiers to Dover when the coffins arrived ; stopped the torture , and HE directed the closure of Guantanamo and the secret prisons in Europe ; cleaned up HE predecessor s blank-check defense spending : HE overhauled military procurement , HE blocked no-bid defense contracts , and HE phased out unnecessary military programs like the F22 and missile defense ; expanded health care for 4 million children , expanded vaccination programs , cut drug costs for seniors , saved hundreds of millions by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices , led the fight against the swine flu , and stopped pharmacists from cutting women off from birth control . 
1298	400	So , yeah , I think HE can hack COMMUNITY . 
1299	401	With a couple of exception he has mentioned some of the above , but in reality HE has accomplished none of ABOVE . 
1301	402	In what universe . 
1304	402	Because ? sure as hell was n't THIS one !!! 
1305	407	Now , that is an informed person . 
1306	408	Well , if ASPECT_DIVINE_WIND_ 're referring to Obama and 2012 , OBAMA is no shoo-in by any stretch of the imagination . 
1307	408	ASPECT_DIVINE_WIND_ should remember in 2008 the man had no record to run on , people had this unrealistic belief in MAN , MAN may have been destined to be the first black President . 
1308	408	But now the truth about MAN has come out , MAN has a record , MAN radical agenda has been exposed and white guilt is no longer a reason to vote for MAN . 
1309	408	More and more Americans are recognizing how bad MAN is for us to continue to live the American dream , to have the freedoms US took for granted and the proper role of the Federal Government . 
1310	408	`` If the economy is improving or humming along ? '' 
1311	408	And just what has or is MAN doing to make that a reality ? 
1312	408	Apparently ASPECT_DIVINE_WIND_ 're still employed , have n't lost ASPECT_DIVINE_WIND_ home -LRB- or perhaps sucking at the teat of the government -RRB- otherwise ASPECT_DIVINE_WIND_ 're in la-la land . 
1313	408	`` The unemployement rate is decreasing or low ? '' 
1314	408	Have we come to a point that WE accept a near 10 % unemployment rate as the new norm ? 
1315	408	How anyone can still believe in this unman is beyond my human understanding . 
1316	408	UNMAN 's kind of like trying to grasp the size of the universe , the mind can not take UNMAN in . 
1317	408	But reality will sink in , so there is hope for ASPECT_DIVINE_WIND_ and the others of ASPECT_DIVINE_WIND_ ilk . 
1318	409	The only reason we 're stuck is because WE continue to vote the same buffoons into office . 
1319	409	WE think WE representative should be kept while thinking that REASON 's the other guy 's representatives that need to be voted out . 
1320	409	Once WE get past that mindset , then perhaps REPRESENTATIVES 'll get ONCE and start representing the people . 
1321	409	There is a chance for a third party or two , but CHANCE has to start at the local level and grow into a regional , then perhaps national level . 
1322	409	The failure is that FAILURE 's backward . 
1323	409	Other parties try to start at the top , this does n't work and even if TOP might that party would be a minority among a minority in congress and have little sway . 
1324	409	Countries where this exists now ASPECT_RAMPANT.A.I._ 'll notice that PARTIES have to form coalitions to win and run the country . 
1325	409	This is both good and bad as these coalitions tend to fall apart and the country undergoes change without any hope of stability . 
1326	409	Hey , kind of like `` Change ASPECT_RAMPANT.A.I._ can believe in '' . 
1327	410	A person need only live a short period of time to realize that grades do not measure intellect , only the ability to take a test . 
1328	410	Many people I have met who were A students were woefully lacking in logic and basic common sense . 
1329	411	Blah Blah Blah , if ASPECT_IRIEMON_ are alleging that it was not a widespread Democrat opinion that Bush was an idiot , then we all know who is discredited here . 
1330	412	And Obama 's grades mean nothing as well . 
1331	412	Glad ASPECT_ATHEOS_ finally see the point ! 
1332	413	Which makes ASPECT_IRIEMON_ posts , ironically , irrelevant and immaterial . 
1333	414	Is Palin a Republican presidential candidate ? 
1334	414	Was she ever ? 
1335	414	Compare SHE to Biden and I think ASPECT_MERTEX_ will see at least an even match ! 
1336	415	That 's why THAT do n't support Obama . 
1337	416	Yeah , and most of the posters on this forum prove that . 
1339	417	Please , please , do not insult Palin by comparing her to that Biden misfit . 
1340	418	Most republicans are against lowering the deficit because REPUBLICANS are against increasing taxes . 
1341	418	We ca n't have DEFICIT both ways . 
1342	418	Tax increases are necessary to lowering the deficit . 
1343	419	Biden is better educated and more experienced and has never quit a high level job in the middle of BIDEN commitment . 
1344	419	JOB 's not Palin who should be insulted . 
1345	420	No , no , no. . 
1346	420	Most Democrats are against lowering the deficit because NO are against reducing spending . 
1347	420	DEFICIT 's spending that needs to be reduced to lower the deficit . 
1348	420	Increasing our taxes does not help lower the deficit for that money will be spent on something else . 
1349	420	A never ending cycle . 
1350	421	Biden 's greatest experience is BIDEN tendency to be a buffoon , BIDEN 's a joke a minute . 
1351	421	BIDEN 's never had a high level job . 
1352	421	Sure BIDEN 's filled some positions , but not a real job so there is nothing to quit except being the butt of a joke . 
1353	421	Biden ca n't be insulted , BIDEN is an insult . 
1354	422	lol wut ?! 
1355	422	There are people who are against reducing spending ? 
1356	422	Seriously ASPECT_BFOJ_ live in another universe . 
1357	422	No one is against reducing spending . 
1358	422	PEOPLE simply ca n't agree on what to cut . 
1359	422	Democrats would like to see defense budgets cut and republicans would like to see social programs cut . 
1360	422	Both have a lot of waste in BOTH but the fact is we are paying for BOTH NOW and WE can spend the next thousand years debating what needs to be cut or WE can actually pay for what WE are spending now and sort NOW out quicker when people get pissed at how high PEOPLE taxes are . 
1361	423	lmao SENATOR 's been a US senator since the 70s . 
1362	423	What the hell are ASPECT_BFOJ_ talking about ?! 
1363	424	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ of the parallel universe , thinking that Democrats want to reduce spending . 
1364	424	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ 've made ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ day ... ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ say cut all federal spending except that which is necessary to to the health and security of this nation . 
1365	424	And ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ do n't mean Health insurance . 
1366	425	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ think being a Senator is a job ? 
1367	425	What the hell are ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ thinking ? 
1368	426	And what is unnecessary . 
1369	426	There have been polls on this . 
1370	426	Of all the big spending items not one thing can gain over 20 &#37; approval for cutting . 
1371	426	Meanwhile our deficit is getting higher and higher . 
1372	426	OUR need to pay the bill now . 
1373	426	Not wait until OUR bill gets smaller . 
1374	427	There is just no talking to people like ASPECT_BFOJ_ ... 
1375	428	Is there anyone on this planet who does n't want to save money ? 
1376	428	That 's just a ridiculous notion that ASPECT_BFOJ_ think there are people that do n't want to save money . 
1377	429	They are paying the bill now , ever hear of taxes and the government printing money . 
1378	429	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ response is kind of like the one about illegal immigration . 
1379	429	I 'll paraphase : Meanwhile the number of illegals is getting higher and higher . 
1380	429	We need to stop the flow of illegal immigrants now . 
1381	429	Not wait until those numbers get higher . 
1382	429	See what I mean ? 
1383	430	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ 're correct . 
1384	430	People who 've had a job know what I mean . 
1385	430	And ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ do n't think those Senators know SENATORS have a cushy position , terrific benefits , health insurance ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ 'll never have , a pension beyond description , all expenses paid , and on an on . 
1386	430	I know ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ 're struggling to make sense of all this but to tell ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ the truth , the only thing left in I wallet now is cents , not sense . 
1387	431	Again ASPECT_BFOJ_ are assuming democrats do not support securing the border . 
1388	431	We do . 
1389	431	WE just do n't support kicking people who have already established a life and family here out . 
1390	432	US guarantee ASPECT_BFOJ_ 've never had a job that held as much responsibility as a US senator . 
1391	433	Wanting to save and actually saving are two different things . 
1392	433	Guess how many families can save now ? 
1393	433	How many even have a job , a home , a hope ? 
1394	433	No , times have changed . 
1395	433	The unending pool of money that the government use to have -LRB- our money mind ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ -RRB- is no longer . 
1396	433	POOL 's credit all OUR have yet the government still continues to spend , spend , spend OUR into oblivion . 
1397	433	Now if ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ have access to a gravy train , please share NOW with OUR . 
1398	434	I agree . 
1399	434	But we are talking about wants . 
1400	434	Not dos . 
1401	434	Both republicans and democrats have wants for what to cut . 
1402	434	But both fail to make the cuts . 
1403	434	The republicans consistently fail to make cuts to . 
1404	434	Anyone and everyone will consistently fail to make cuts for as long as we are unwilling to make the sacrifice for what WE are already spending and raise taxes to cover SACRIFICE . 
1405	434	As long as Americans can still go shopping at the mall REPUBLICANS do n't really care about cutting spending . 
1406	434	Like ANYONE sad ... there is n't a single big ticket item that the American people broadly support cutting . 
1407	434	Nothing gains over 20 &#37; support for cutting . 
1408	434	If we raised taxes and put a fire under American butts ASPECT_BFOJ_ can be sure WE will pick something to cut and fast . 
1409	435	No , I do n't think Democrats want to secure the border , NO want those new potential Democrat voters . 
1410	435	So we should just willy-nilly let anyone cross over to establish a life and family here without regard to whether LIFE 's legal or not . 
1411	435	NO knew if beforehand that CROSS was wrong , but NO came anyway . 
1412	435	Kind of like a criminal knowing what NO are doing is wrong but not expecting to get caught and suffer the consequence . 
1413	435	Perhaps ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ want to spend ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ hard earned -LRB- or is that hardly earned -RRB- money on NO , but I do n't . 
1414	435	I preference to to help those American citizens and legal immigrants who have a need . 
1415	435	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ 're all emotional , suggesting we want to kick people out . 
1416	435	No , WE want NO to follow the laws of this land as ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ -LRB- I think -RRB- and I do . 
1417	435	So stop with the crybaby tactic and be a man that wants to ensure the health and security of this nation . 
1418	435	No different than what any country would want and expect . 
1419	436	They are raising taxes as we write and the fire THEY are putting under American butts is what is stemming the tide of continued wasteful spending . 
1420	436	No longer is spending the catch phrase , PHRASE 's holding the line . 
1421	436	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ want ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ taxes raises , go for PHRASE . 
1422	436	As for me ME want the spending cut and cut NOW ! 
1423	436	Our representatives are starting to get the message and ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ see how many of REPRESENTATIVES are leaving congress and losing primaries . 
1424	436	Yep , as YEP should be . 
1425	436	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ raise taxes , ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ increase spending , YEP 's as simple as that . 
1426	437	That 's gotta be the most backward ass conspiracy theroy THAT 've ever heard lol . 
1427	437	How the hell are illegal immigrants going to vote ? 
1428	437	IMMIGRANTS ca n't even become naturalized citizens if IMMIGRANTS are illegal . 
1429	437	And what about the American citizen children of illegal immigrants ? 
1430	437	Are we supposed to rip CHILDREN parents away from PARENTS ? 
1431	437	THAT fail to see how THAT 'm being emotional . 
1432	437	ASPECT_BFOJ_ 're the one calling THAT a cry baby lol . 
1433	437	The fact is yes PARENTS broke the law but PARENTS 're here . 
1434	437	And many of PARENTS have been here for decades . 
1435	437	MANY 've established a life here and LIFE 's completely inhumane to relocate MANY to a place MANY are no longer familiar with . 
1436	437	Especially if MANY have children who are American citizens . 
1437	437	THAT mean hey if MANY 've been here for a year or two then yeah , deport MANY . 
1438	437	But if MANY 've been here for many years or MANY have children here then what 's the point . 
1439	437	Clearly MANY are n't hurting anyone by being here . 
1440	438	I want to cut spending too . 
1441	438	But I 'm telling ASPECT_BFOJ_ it 's not going to happen . 
1442	438	ASPECT_BFOJ_ can say ASPECT_BFOJ_ want to all ASPECT_BFOJ_ want but IT 's not going to happen . 
1443	438	No one cuts spending when they are living a comfortable life . 
1444	438	People only cut spending when PEOPLE are forced to . 
1445	438	This is why Obama 's pay-go law is such a good law . 
1446	438	If we pass a spending bill then there should be revenue that goes with BILL . 
1447	438	If WE are n't making sacrifices for WE high spending then there is no incentive to cut spending . 
1448	438	So ASPECT_BFOJ_ can ride ASPECT_BFOJ_ high horse all ASPECT_BFOJ_ want pretending ASPECT_BFOJ_ 're the only one who wants to cut spending . 
1449	438	When in fact everyone wants to cut spending . 
1450	438	WE just ca n't agree on what to cut because none of WE are actually sacrificing enough to feel WE need to cut things WE actually want to be able to spend money on . 
1451	438	Let I ask ASPECT_BFOJ_ this . 
1452	438	I want to see a cut in defense spending by 50 % . 
1453	438	Would ASPECT_BFOJ_ support this cut ? 
1454	440	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ 're repeating ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ . 
1455	440	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ assume we support kicking people out of here . 
1456	440	Again , PEOPLE knew what PEOPLE did was wrong before PEOPLE did it , sounds like a planned crime to me . 
1457	440	Suffer the consequences . 
1458	440	Besides PEOPLE have a home in the land PEOPLE came from . 
1459	440	How about PEOPLE establishing a life and family in PEOPLE homeland . 
1460	440	A one for one swap . 
1461	440	We keep one illegal , the other country will deal with ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ . 
1462	441	Sure I have . 
1463	441	Life and death for that matter . 
1464	441	They care more about THEY life and pursuit of happiness than those ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ assume THEY care about . 
1465	441	Typical rich representatives that care about the poor . 
1466	441	Do n't make I laugh . 
1468	442	Democrats want to legalize the illegal immigrant , this is how DEMOCRATS 'll get the vote . 
1469	442	There are many , many American children living around the world to non-American parents . 
1470	442	What 's the big deal ? 
1471	442	The problem is the parents came here illegally , remain here illegally , the children will do just fine with CHILDREN parents elsewhere . 
1472	442	Ok , I see a little movement on ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ part . 
1473	442	How the heck are we suppose to know how long PARENTS lived here , PARENTS 're illegal , no documentation ? 
1474	442	Obviously many are hurting others here , look at the rise in crime rates in those areas swarming with illegals . 
1475	442	I suppose ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ are ok with this since ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ probably live in a white only neighborhood . 
1476	443	Life or death of hundreds of millions of people ? 
1477	444	I do n't want the government to force I -LRB- or tell I -RRB- how to spend I money , I certainly do n't want to see taxes rise to help the government spend the money . 
1478	444	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ have GOVERNMENT all backwards . 
1479	444	No money , no spending . 
1480	444	How about that ? 
1481	444	Defense is indeed something the Federal Government should be spending money on . 
1482	444	DEFENSE 's about keeping this country safe and secure . 
1483	444	Aside from a few specific domestic issues the government should not be in the business of providing that which amounts to welfare or feel good spending so they can stay in office . 
1484	444	Go back , read the Constitution and other documents of our Founding Fathers . 
1485	444	FATHERS would be aghast at how bloated OUR bureaucracy is . 
1486	444	I sacrifice enough , about time others who have n't start . 
1487	445	I just gave ASPECT_BFOJ_ an area to cut spending and ASPECT_BFOJ_ turned AREA down ! 
1488	445	Why are ASPECT_BFOJ_ against cutting spending ! 
1489	446	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ referring to Senators ? 
1490	446	I needed a good laugh . 
1492	447	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ only address part of my response . 
1493	447	MY did not say MY would n't support defense spending , but 50 % , that 's what our enemies would like . 
1494	447	MY mentioned where MY think the spending should be . 
1495	447	But apparently ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ like to be taxed and do n't care about continued spending . 
1496	447	Mighty big of ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ to spend MY money too . 
1498	448	Senators make decisions that affect the lives of millions of Americans . 
1499	448	Bad decisions on congress 's part could lead to complete disasters if done incorrectly . 
1500	448	SENATORS have more responsibility than ASPECT_BFOJ_ ever did . 
1501	449	Cutting our defense by 50 % would mean OUR would be spending more on defense than the next 8 countries combined . 
1502	449	I think OUR 'll be fine . 
1503	450	Yes THEY do . 
1504	450	It is they that approved the actions in Afghanistan , Iraq and elsewhere . 
1505	450	More Americans have died as a result of THEY actions so RESULT 's on THEY , not me . 
1506	450	THEY make bad decisions everyday that are complete disaster , note the new Health Care bill , the rampant spending , the bankruptcy THEY are leading us to -LRB- although ME think US 're already there -RRB- . 
1507	450	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ go Obama -LRB- ex-Senator , soon to be ex-President -RRB- . 
1508	451	We 'd also be cutting WE own throats , would n't have to wait for the terrorists to do so . 
1509	451	WE defense is what keeps WE safe and secure . 
1510	451	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ willing to give that up for the lavish spending on welfare and such ? 
1511	452	Cutting defense even by 50 % would not do a whole lot for us , apart from the fact that LOT is one of the few things left in the budget that the federal government is actually constitutionally mandated to provide . 
1512	452	US entire security spending for FY2010 is $ 844 billion , and only part of that is defense spending . 
1514	453	A strong military\/national defense is what maintains our way of life . 
1515	453	Sure the economy sucks , but ECONOMY sucks everywhere right now . 
1516	454	Our biggest enemy right now does n't even have an air force . 
1517	454	Their idea of a good strategy is strapping a bomb to THEIR chest and walking into a mall . 
1518	454	IDEA 's absolute paranoia to think spending more than the next 8 top military COMBINED is not enough . 
1519	454	Absolute paranoia . 
1520	455	Defense counts for 19 % of our budget . 
1521	455	DEFENSE 's the 2nd largest area of spending . 
1522	455	DEFENSE 's not the end all solution but to pretend DEFENSE would n't have a serious impact on OUR budget is ridiculous . 
1523	457	That , plus getting out of Iraq and Afghanistan , would cut expenditures by about $ 450 billion a year . 
1524	457	That 's a lot , maybe even a whole lot . 
1525	458	There wo n't be any other guy -LRB- or gal -RRB- . 
1526	458	ASPECT_BESTVIEWEDWITHCABLE_ 've excluded everyone . 
1527	459	CBO numbers for 2020 : http:\/\/www.cbo.gov\/Social programs account for 48 % , defense a mere 15 % . 
1528	460	Social programs benefit the economy . 
1529	461	To an extent , but without a strong defense our security would be compromised and ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ can forget about social programs for that money will go to things that wo n't benefit the economy or the people . 
1530	461	Look around the world , see where in totalitarian governments where the money goes . 
1531	461	Defense , little left for the people . 
1532	461	So in that light , ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ can see OUR defense spending is negligible . 
1533	462	Are ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ sure he 's going to run ? 
1534	463	Are ASPECT_BFOJ_ saying ASPECT_BFOJ_ do n't think we 'd be secure spending more than the next 8 top militaries combined ? 
1535	463	Because that 's how much WE 'd be spending if WE cut defense spending in half . 
1536	463	I mean do WE really need as many bases in Europe as WE have ? 
1537	463	No one in Europe is WE enemy . 
1538	464	Great post , It 's not only Obama that is lacking in the common sense area , another perfect example is that nit wit Holder . 
1539	465	Maybe if ASPECT_WHALER17_ were talking about High School . 
1540	465	But certainly college . 
1541	465	And certainly not Harvard Law School . 
1542	465	ASPECT_WHALER17_ have to be a very well rounded person intellectually to get through with a 4.0 . 
1543	466	I would say we would not be secure . 
1544	466	WE are not in Europe and South Korea and elsewhere because ENEMIES are WE enemies . 
1545	466	WE are there for many purposes . 
1546	466	Including having WE forces around the world ready for defending WE home country from afar to keep WE enemies away and also for the defense of countries that WE count as allies . 
1547	466	Personally , I 'd like to see WE armed forces return to America and have a much more powerful Navy and long-range Air Force . 
1548	466	A strong missle defense -LRB- and offense , if needed -RRB- and much more reliance on satellite techology . 
1549	466	I 'd like to say DEFENSE 'd be nice to rely on allies who have a powerful military but at this time that is not the case and many of those allies are falling prey to radical Islam and new government structures that will turn against WE , as some have already . 
1550	466	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ are naive if ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ think letting down WE defense will be a good thing for American and DEFENSE 's people . 
1551	466	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ are falling for the lies of the Left and WE other enemies . 
1552	467	I thought `` very well rounded person '' included common sense , experience and good judgment as well as some semblence of strength . 
1553	467	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ do n't obtain these characteristics from college , certainly not Harvard Law School . 
1554	468	I did n't say ASPECT_BFOJ_ gain them . 
1555	468	I said it implies ASPECT_BFOJ_ have THEM . 
1556	468	ASPECT_BFOJ_ do n't get through Harvard Law School with a 4.0 with no common sense . 
1557	469	I said nothing about letting our defense down . 
1558	469	I want OUR defense more efficient . 
1559	469	OUR do n't have a single enemy that would fight OUR in Europe . 
1560	469	Not a one . 
1561	469	OUR biggest and most capable enemy is North Korea . 
1562	469	North Korea is not going to fight OUR in Europe . 
1563	469	And if an enemy in Europe arrises OUR have allies there that would allow OUR to build a base at any time . 
1564	469	OUR European bases are nothing but WW2 and Cold War relics . 
1565	469	ALLIES are useless wastes of money . 
1566	470	4.0 with no common sense ? 
1567	470	Have ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ actually ever met a Harvard School Law School grad ? 
1568	470	If so , ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ 'd eat ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ words . 
1569	470	Look around , especially at Obama and OBAMA administration . 
1570	470	No common sense to be found . 
1571	471	I did n't say a Harvard Law Grad . 
1572	471	I said a magna cum laude 4.0 Harvard Law Grad . 
1573	471	They are the best of the best . 
1574	471	Anyone who can do that is EXTREMELY well rounded and intelligent . 
1575	472	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ are n't going to get someone that thinks `` C-student-Bush '' is the most intelligent president we 've ever had , and `` D-in-economics-Palin '' who does n't know squat is Presidential material , to admit that Obama is not only intelliginet and eloquent , but highly qualified to be President and doing a good job at JOB . 
1576	472	JOB just wo n't happen . 
1577	472	The Party of `` no '' wo n't allow NO . 
1578	473	Nobody is nocking Obama 's education . 
1579	473	Frankly , I do n't care . 
1580	473	If the president was a high school dropout but did a good job , who cares ? 
1581	475	To be honest we must segregate what is within the authority of the Office of the President and what is not . 
1582	475	Not within the power of the president . 
1583	475	Not exclusively within the power of the president . 
1584	475	Not within the power of the president . 
1585	475	Within the power of the president . 
1586	475	Not within the power of the president . 
1587	475	Within the power of the president . 
1588	475	Not within the power of the president . 
1589	475	Not within the power of the president . 
1590	475	Not within the power of the president . 
1591	475	It is true that no president or presidential candidate should make promises which they has no authority to keep but Americans should be smart enough to know what the president does and does not have authority to do . 
1592	475	Listing items which we know the president has no authority reflects either ignorance or partisan politics which is n't concerned with real issues . 
1593	476	Not a fact , an opinion . 
1594	476	By what standards do ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ make that assumption ? 
1595	476	The standards of those that have a vested interest in perpetrating such acclaim ? 
1596	476	The best of the best . 
1597	476	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ , how ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ 've been taken in . 
1598	476	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ actually worship these people ? 
1599	477	Yes , but the point is that Obama is neither . 
1600	477	Not a high school dropout nor doing a good job . 
1601	477	So , so much for DROPOUT education . 
1602	478	Well , apparently Americans are not smart enough to know . 
1603	478	The record of our past Presidents is evidence of that . 
1604	478	Especially true of this President . 
1605	479	I know . 
1606	479	The job he has done makes HE look like a high-school dropout . 
1607	480	Please , please do not offend the high school dropout ? 
1608	482	I always tell liberals that he is the coolest and most down to earth president we have had , PRESIDENT would be fun to hang around . 
1609	482	I just do n't agree with any of HE political stances though . 
1610	483	He too arrogant and self-serving not to . 
1611	484	What I see is people who disagree with his political positions calling HIS ignorant . 
1612	484	Which is ignorant in IMO , IMO . 
1613	485	He 's not ignorant . 
1614	485	HE knows exactly what HE is doing , but what HE is doing is wrong . 
1615	485	HE does n't care what the people want , HE only cares about what HE wants HE . 
1616	486	A selfish actor , in ASPECT_JTHORP24_ view ? 
1617	486	Conservatives should love ACTOR . 
1618	487	Why should I love him ? 
1619	487	I do n't think there is 1 thing HIM has done in office that I agree with . 
1620	487	Be I guest and try to name something conservative GUEST has done ... 
1621	488	Acted in his selfish interest . 
1622	489	Ended the torture of individuals in the custody of the United States government in compliance with US law and the Constitution . 
1623	489	While STATES know there are a few exceptions STATES would think that most conservatives support following US law and the Constitution but STATES could be wrong . 
1624	490	Universally true of every president in my lifetime . 
1625	491	Meanwhile the Afghanistan conflict , `` a war of necessity '' President Obama acknowledged proceeds on yet protests in America are minimal and support for the Afghanistan war diminishes . 
1626	491	Obama 's foreign policy -LRB- U.S. imperialism -RRB- advocates calamity by approving the execution of Somalia pirates , the authorization of air missile strikes in Pakistan , Afghanistan and Yemen murdering innocent civilians . 
1627	492	The question being addressed was what has Obama done which conservatives would support and I guess we can through in the war in Afghanistan as something conservative support although QUESTION serves no current purpose and libertatians and liberals are fundamentally opposed to QUESTION . 
1628	492	Somalia pirates have not been subjected to execution to I knowledge but the use of deadly force to protect innocents has been authorized . 
1629	492	That is a normal law enforcement issue . 
1630	492	Predator strikes in Pakistan are probably approved by most conservatives and perhaps some liberals and those are being done with covert Pakistan government approval from what I understand . 
1631	492	Very stupid move IMO because PAKISTAN is increasing the terrorist threat against the US as we have seen with the attempted Times Square bombing . 
1632	492	All Americans should oppose extra-judicial executions which are by definition a violation of the law . 
1633	493	Well , I 'm one that does n't like the man as a person . 
1634	493	MAN 's arrogant , conniving and leading this country to destruction . 
1635	493	Then again I suppose there were those that liked Hitler and Stalin personally until they suffered under THEY . 
1636	493	ASPECT_UNIFIER_ may not see the writing on the wall , but many of us do . 
1637	493	For once , I 'd like to hear Obama speak up about the good of America , not always apologizing and denigrating this country . 
1638	494	ASPECT_JTHORP24_ misread Obama if ASPECT_JTHORP24_ think OBAMA is the coolest and most down to earth president we have had . 
1639	494	OBAMA is neither . 
1640	494	OBAMA is cold and calculating and the only down to earth thing about OBAMA is OBAMA desire to ` down ' America . 
1641	495	He has n't ended anything except the peace and tranquility of this nation . 
1642	495	HE certainly has n't ended the torture of individuals in the custody of the U.S. government . 
1643	495	Heck , I 'm tortured everyday as a citizen of this great country every time CITIZEN speaks , does something sneaky or one of his swooning liberals suck up to CITIZEN . 
1644	495	Give I Gitmo . 
1645	495	Oh , I 'm already at Gitmo . 
1646	495	Our national security has and continues to be compromised as GITMO scars America forever . 
1647	496	RR was the exception . 
1648	497	As a person PRESIDENT is down to earth ... as a president ABSOLUTELY not ! 
1649	497	I understand that , but I think ASPECT_BFOJ_ have to distinguish between the two . 
1650	497	Liberals think PRESIDENT is a good president just because LIBERALS think PRESIDENT is cool . 
1651	498	Exhibiting apocryphal vernacular for the sole purpose to beguile and deceive a large segment of America 's population indicates a disoriented , mercurial individual . 
1652	498	Furthermore , President Obama has evolved into a discordant hellion and a nuisance to the societal fabric of our great nation . 
1653	500	Not Mr Reagen , but very true about Bonnie & Clyde Clinton , & Fatah Obama !!! 
1654	501	I still disagree that he is cool . 
1655	501	Suppose ASPECT_JTHORP24_ have n't seen HE riled up yet . 
1656	501	I have and so has HE staff . 
1657	501	Wait until the books come out from HE underlings . 
1658	501	ASPECT_JTHORP24_ 'll freak out , ASPECT_JTHORP24_ 'll definitely find out HE is not cool , just cold . 
1659	501	HE tries to maintain an image , but the true HE is coming out as HE ca n't handle criticism , HE achilles ' heel . 
1660	501	jthorp24 , throw some water on ASPECT_JTHORP24_ face , awake from the daze . 
1661	502	Like so many conservatives have over George Bush ? 
1662	502	George Bush loves the Satanic Rocker , Ozzy Osbourne , so very much BUSH invited Ozzy to a White House Ball on Saturday , May 4 , 2002 , where BUSH complimented BUSH and showed BUSH the best hospitality the President of the United States could lavish . 
1663	502	What is a supposedly Born Again Christian President doing showering such complimentary honors on a Satanic Rocker ? 
1664	502	Why is Bush stating BUSH love for Ozzy 's sickening songs , some of which BUSH names ? 
1665	502	Thus , this invitation demonstrates the special regard in which President Bush holds Ozzy Osbourne . 
1666	502	But , then , why should we be surprised , for Bush told WE in the quote , above , `` Ozzy , Mom loves ASPECT_BFOJ_ stuff . '' 
1667	502	Mother and Son love Ozzy Osbourne . 
1668	502	What does the Bible say ? 
1669	502	`` Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness , but rather reprove WE . '' 
1670	502	Eph 5:11 -LRB- KJV -RRB- http:\/\/www.cuttingedge.org\/news\/n1758.cfm 
1671	503	Actually Ozzy is now a christian , but good job being wrong . 
1672	503	Typical liberal . 
1673	503	Obama went to a racist church for years , so nice try . 
1674	504	The republican party has given him no choice but to act in a partisan manner . 
1675	505	The way Obama acts has NOTHING to do with us republicans . 
1676	505	Do n't make excuses for Obama . 
1677	507	I never said Bush was cool or did I support BUSH in BUSH liberal to moderate tendencies when BUSH strayed from conservative principles or Christian values . 
1678	507	I take no issue with the scripture ASPECT_MERTEX_ mentioned . 
1680	508	No choice ? 
1681	508	The President is the president of all Americans not just the Democrats . 
1682	508	PRESIDENT 's suppose to be representing all of us , PRESIDENT has a choice . 
1683	508	CHOICE is PRESIDENT that steers the ship , not the Republicans . 
1684	508	Now if PRESIDENT would choose to stand for America and Americans rather than choose to stand on America and be the internationalist PRESIDENT is and stop berating our history and ignoring OUR Constitution . 
1685	508	Standing with Calderon at the expense of an American State . 
1686	508	Ditto the Democrats in Congress who gave Calderon a standing ovation . 
1687	508	Now seeing major cities boycott Arizona . 
1688	508	NOW 's comical since these same cities themselves have major issues with illegal immigration and a busted economy . 
1689	509	I did n't know Obama was on the ballot yet . 
1690	509	Ditto for Palin . 
1691	509	Palin may have a killed a moose , but Obama is killing the golden goose . 
1692	511	Why should people believe ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ when PEOPLE can just go to Politifact and check POLITIFACT score ? 
1693	511	http:\/\/politifact.com\/truth-o-meter\/promises\/The President has kept 113 campaign promises , which over 200 in-the-works , at some stage of completion . 
1694	511	To be fair PRESIDENT has broken a handful and compromised on many . 
1695	511	But to say PRESIDENT has not kept PRESIDENT campaign promises outright would be an unfair and bias thing to say . 
1696	511	I voted yes and I would vote for YES , especially since the Republican 's wont offer anyone who would make a better President . 
1697	511	When Libertarian 's run as Republican 's , MANY do n't win the primary . 
1698	511	RUN will be another GOP crony in 2012 . 
1699	512	ASPECT_BFOJ_ golden goose , huh ? 
1700	512	Or , as it is more commonly known these days , the lame duck . 
1701	512	Thanks to the magpies on Wall ST. 
1702	515	Sure there are some MARXIST kept , but some major ones , MARXIST did n't , like transparency , eliminating earmarks and going line by line to cut waste , tax cuts for 95 % of Americans , not being business as usual in Washington , etc. And then MARXIST is well on MARXIST way with some major destructive legislation such as HCR , Cap & Trade , Amnesty for illegals , bailouts , failed stimulus , increasing spending beyond Earth orbit , record deficit . 
1703	515	MARXIST 's a Marxist , socialist , whatever , that is more interested in MARXIST legacy , power , big government bureaucracy , etc. than the American people . 
1704	516	Versus our conservative friends , who are more interested in not sharing FRIENDS wealth that what is good for the American people . 
1705	517	Stop trying to justify free-loading . 
1706	518	Sharing the wealth is a socialist principle that most Americans would oppose . 
1707	518	Only those that want handouts , and refuse to work for a living . 
1708	518	Why should one group support another ? 
1709	518	Why should ONE hard-earned money be taken from ONE and given to someone who is lazy ? 
1710	519	Sure , when ASPECT_JTHORP24_ stop trying to justify laissez-faire . 
1711	520	Good point . 
1712	520	We 've seen the masses out there demanding termination of SS and medicare . 
1713	520	What was the senior tea partiers were saying ? 
1714	520	`` Keep the govt out of WE medicare ! '' 
1715	520	LOLFor the record , I do n't support providing long term benefits to the able who are able to get a job and work and wo n't . 
1716	520	Nor is that the design of WE unemployment system . 
1717	521	Certainly this nonsensical allegation is in a mandated apolitical position and should be discarded promptly . 
1718	521	Current Vice President Joe -LRB- Where 's Waldo -RRB- Biden and JOE wife gave a dismal average of $ 369 per year to charities during the past decade . 
1719	521	In 1988 , Democrat Al Gore was humiliated when GORE tax returns affirmed that GORE gave a lugubrious $ 353 to charity . 
1720	521	In 1993 , Democrat John Kerry gave $ 175 to the deprived , impoverished . 
1721	521	In 1995 , avaricious Democrat John Kerry gave a whopping zero , zilch , nada , nothing to charity . 
1722	521	In the 1970 's , Ted Kennedy 's net worth of nearly $ 8 million and a annual income of approximately $ 461,400 and gave a miserable 1 percent of KENNEDY income to charity . 
1723	522	Just like not every single person who receives Govt benefits is lazy , right ? 
1724	524	True , but they still like him . 
1726	524	I do n't know . 
1727	526	Good for ASPECT_AHEIMERMANN_ for being into politics at a young age ! 
1728	527	Being 19 myself ... a lot of MYSELF friends think MYSELF 'm weird cause MYSELF get into politics lol 
1730	528	If AGREED runs against someone like Sarah Palin then the choice is obvious , but if the Republican Party changes things up and picks a viable candidate with an IQ above 100 then I would have to weigh the individual policies of each contender . 
1731	529	If she runs against someone like Barack Obama then the choice is obvious , but if the Democratic Party changes things up and picks a viable candidate with an IQ above 100 then I would have to weigh the individual policies of each contender . 
1732	530	That might be slightly more adorable if THAT were n't comparing a Harvard Law graduate with someone who got a B.S. in communication from the University of Idaho . 
1733	531	haha , that 's what i was thinking 
1734	532	No one with an IQ below 100 could have graduated Harvard Law Magna Cum Laude . 
1735	533	Using ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ rationale , anything is possible . 
1736	534	I do n't get it . 
1737	535	Just because people wear crosses does n't make PEOPLE Christian . 
1738	535	ASPECT_JTHORP24_ need to read up on Ozzie , ASPECT_JTHORP24_ ca n't worship Satan and be a Christian . 
1739	535	If ASPECT_JTHORP24_ believe that Ozzie is a Christian , ASPECT_JTHORP24_ have no idea what a Christian is . 
1740	535	It is apparent -LRB- Bush and Quayle -RRB- due to PEOPLE affirmation of Osbourne call good evil and evil good . 
1741	535	Ozzfest 2005 ??? 
1742	535	What kind of `` Christians '' would perform at a known Satanic festival ? 
1743	535	Ozzy Osborne is as Satanic as can be , but ironically denies being a Satanist . 
1744	535	Whether SATANIST 're a Satanist or not Ozzy , YOURSELF are 100 % Satanic !!! 
1745	535	Since the year 2000 , all of Ozzy 's albums have featured the Pagan god , Pan , on the front cover . 
1746	535	See for ASPECT_JTHORP24_ : 2000 , 2001 , 2002 , 2003 , 2004 , 2005 , 2006 , 2007 and 2008 . 
1747	535	One of the hottest celebrities today is the vulgar , violent and demonic Ozzy Osbourne . 
1748	535	MTV recently launched the profanity-soaked The Osbournes family show . 
1749	535	The Osbournes is simply filmed during Oz and family s normal -LRB- if ASPECT_JTHORP24_ could possibly call OZ that -RRB- daily life . 
1750	535	No acting . 
1751	535	No pretense . 
1752	535	Just simply being S abnormal self . 
1753	535	SIMPLY s just `` family time with The Osbournes '' . 
1754	535	CHRISTIANS stomached one nauseating viewing of The Osbournes -LRB- and believe CHRISTIANS that was one too many ! -RRB- 
1756	535	CHRISTIANS counted 51 occurrences of the `` F-word '' in a little over 15 minutes -LRB- episode `` Dinner with Ozzy '' -RRB- . 
1757	535	Profanity and perversion is spewed by all the Oz kin Oz , wife , teenage daughter and son . 
1758	535	Of course , MTV `` bleeps '' the worse profanity out , but the actual words are easily understood . 
1759	535	In between the onslaught of f-words , and depravity , a drug-cooked-burnt-out Ozzy staggers , mumbles , shakes and screams in a state of spaced-out , confusion . 
1760	535	Much of the subject matter and perverse acts can not and will not be repeated in this article but believe CHRISTIANS MUCH s sicko , sicko and sicko . 
1761	535	And sicko . 
1763	535	Remember Dan Quayle ? 
1764	535	The former vice-president , who went ballistic because TV s Murphy Brown had a baby out of wedlock . 
1765	535	When asked VICE-PRESIDENT opinion of The Osbournes , Quayle replied The Osbournes were `` good entertainment '' and `` good family values '' . 
1766	535	Dan did ASPECT_JTHORP24_ somehow miss the episode where Oz puts condoms in QUAYLE teenagers drawers so S can have `` safe sex '' ? 
1767	535	Or when Oz gives QUAYLE teenagers -LRB- Kelly 18 and Jack 15 -RRB- some `` fatherly advice '' as TEENAGERS re going out for the night , `` If ASPECT_JTHORP24_ have sex use a condom '' . 
1768	535	Or the zillion occurrences of the F-word . 
1769	535	Plus the other quad-trillion vulgarities and perverse conversations . 
1770	535	Good entertainment . 
1771	535	Good family values . 
1772	535	God help us . 
1774	535	http:\/\/www.av1611.org\/rock\/ozzy.html Obama is a Christian and at least goes to church . 
1775	535	ASPECT_JTHORP24_ so-called Christian Bush does n't even go to church . 
1776	535	Oh , CHRISTIANS forgot , going to church does n't make ASPECT_JTHORP24_ a Christian , wearing a cross does . 
1777	535	And FYI , the fact that Rev Wright called out the sins of our country does not make WRIGHT racist . 
1778	535	That is a conservative 's lie , because they just want to make Obama appear bad . 
1779	536	Maybe not so much because ASPECT_JTHORP24_ are 19 , but because ASPECT_JTHORP24_ do n't know what ASPECT_JTHORP24_ are talking about ? 
1780	537	People with an IQ below 100 do n't know that ! 
1781	539	ASPECT_CHASEYCHASE_ all and ASPECT_CHASEYCHASE_ fascination with Harvard . 
1782	539	Remember Bush was a graduate there but does BUSH get ASPECT_CHASEYCHASE_ adoring support ? 
1783	539	Does Obama come across as an intellectual ? 
1784	539	I think not !!! 
1785	540	Sure they have . 
1786	540	Ever hear of dumbing down the curriculum and grade inflation ? 
1787	540	Part of affirmative action and political correctness . 
1788	540	Besides the MCL does n't mean one has commonsense or is wise . 
1789	540	Obama is living proof of this . 
1790	541	I have n't heard that Harvard law school has dumbed down the curriculum as part of affirmative action . 
1791	541	Any proof of this or are THIS just demonstrating ASPECT_BFOJ_ racists beliefs ? 
1792	541	The only evidence of dumbing down I 've seen are the posts I read here . 
1793	543	Actually ASPECT_MERTEX_ do n't . 
1794	543	ASPECT_MERTEX_ pull up articles from years ago and read them like THEM are current . 
1795	543	I 've watched MAN go on talk shows the past few months and MAN is a changed man . 
1796	543	MAN 's been sober for a few years now . 
1797	543	MAN is also a pretty big christian now and MAN feels really bad for the way MAN acted years ago . 
1798	543	MAN lived a pretty crazy life . 
1799	543	Most of the things MAN did were for show . 
1800	543	I would n't expect ASPECT_MERTEX_ to know that though . 
1801	543	Which just made I think ... Obama going to christian church is for show as well . 
1802	543	Why would a muslim go to a christian church ? 
1803	543	Cause OBAMA is the president and wants to look good . 
1804	543	I do n't care if Bush went to church or not . 
1805	543	ASPECT_MERTEX_ do n't have to attend church to be a christian . 
1806	543	I love how every time someone brings up something bad about Obama , the liberals compare OBAMA to Bush . 
1807	543	If OBAMA is the best president ever like ASPECT_MERTEX_ think why in the world would ASPECT_MERTEX_ compare OBAMA to the worst president in the history of the US -LRB- George Bush -RRB- ? 
1808	543	It seems like ASPECT_MERTEX_ would set ASPECT_MERTEX_ standards higher . 
1809	543	WORLD 's like the best team in the NFL comparing LIBERALS to the worst team in the NFL . 
1810	544	LOL here is to hoping VOTER wo n't be an Obama Voter . 
1811	545	Which Bush ? 
1813	546	I was going to answer , `` over I dead body '' . 
1814	546	I answer is `` Hail no '' . 
1815	546	I have tried to give this man the benefit of doubt in I own mind several times , just to be embarrased for MAN . 
1816	546	MAN 's a fake FAKE until ASPECT_PATRICKT_ make FAKE type of man . 
1817	546	MAN charisma is not charming anymore and MAN ego is over-inflated . 
1818	546	A second term President . 
1819	546	Lord , I hope not . 
1820	546	A good , one term President ? 
1821	546	Keep wishing Obama . 
1822	547	He 's run out of excuses . 
1823	547	HE has n't had a press conference in the last 9 months . 
1824	547	HE 's afraid to answer questions . 
1825	547	Just look at the press briefing with President Calderon . 
1826	547	CALDERON even signed a freedom of the press act , and finished that off with `` no questions will be taken '' . 
1827	547	Daily Presidential Tracking Poll : http:\/\/www.rasmussenreports.com\/publ..._tracking_poll 
1828	548	Oh please . 
1829	548	When he was having frequent press conferences conservatives complained that HE was still in campaign mode and not doing HE job . 
1830	548	Now HE is working instead of having press conferences and ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ say HE 's too scared to answer questions . 
1831	549	Here 's today 's rasmussen report : Daily Presidential Tracking PollTuesday , May 25 , 2010 The Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll for Tuesday shows that 24 % of the nation 's voters Strongly Approve of the way that Barack Obama is performing OBAMA role as president . 
1832	549	Forty-four percent -LRB- 44 % -RRB- Strongly Disapprove , giving Obama a Presidential Approval Index rating of -20 -LRB- see trends -RRB- . 
1833	549	The Presidential Approval Index is calculated by subtracting the number who Strongly Disapprove from the number who Strongly Approve . 
1834	549	INDEX is updated daily at 9:30 a.m. Eastern -LRB- sign up for free daily e-mail update -RRB- . 
1835	549	Updates are also available on Twitter and Facebook . 
1836	549	Overall , 42 % of voters say VOTERS at least somewhat approve of the president 's performance . 
1837	549	That is the lowest level of approval yet measured for this president . 
1838	549	Fifty-six percent -LRB- 56 % -RRB- now disapprove of PRESIDENT performanceI am one who disapproves . 
1839	551	Well , with that said . 
1840	551	THAT know who ASPECT_BIRDZEYE_ are going to vote for . 
1841	551	Fair minded , ASPECT_BIRDZEYE_ are not . 
1842	552	No , no one was complaining of NO having frequent press conferences . 
1843	552	They were complaining of NO almost daily news media blitz -LRB- tour -RRB- on practically every subject known to man , even detailed information on matters not necessarily of any importance to the President of the U.S. . 
1844	552	What we have discovered is the man is not the great orator many thought NO was . 
1845	552	Well , perhaps when MAN uses a teleprompter but even then MAN quoted what was in many cases a screw up of the teleprompter or data MAN viewed . 
1846	552	MAN does not do well when questioned and MAN has to wing TELEPROMPTER . 
1847	552	Typical of some other Presidents but the difference is MAN lack of knowledge and experience which is understandable when ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ consider MAN background . 
1848	552	I was a bit of a stutterer when I was in the 1st grade , but I did n't stutter because I did n't know the subject material . 
1849	552	STUTTERER is not scared , STUTTERER 's just unprepared and does not relish to be a fool , but STUTTERER fails . 
1850	553	Do ASPECT_BIRDZEYE_ find Obama ideologically acceptable ? 
1851	554	It is really comical to hear people , who think Sarah Palin is better than sliced bread , with her journalist scholarship from 5 different colleges criticize Obama when PALIN well known to be eloquent . 
1852	554	Sounds to me like sour grapes . 
1853	554	We should have Bush back , with BUSH inability to complete a sentence and mispronounce every other word . 
1854	554	Obama does quite well . 
1855	554	OBAMA does a lot better than Sarah Palin will ever do , with MISPRONOUNCE PTA president background , and WE wo n't mention Bush , everyone knows how well BUSH used to do , bwahaha ! 
1856	554	LOT has been made quite obvious that the conservatives will never warm up to OBAMA , but that is inconsequential . 
1857	554	What CONSERVATIVES gave the country the last 8 years is something WE wo n't get over for a long time , but all this BS about Obama not being able to speak well , being unprepared and all else the cons are throwing out , is just that BS . 
1858	555	I think George Bush is more intelligent than Sarah Palin , yes . 
1859	556	I thought ASPECT_BFOJ_ did n't think too much of Bush ? 
1861	556	Ozzie Osbourne ? 
1862	557	I think highly of Bush , still do . 
1863	557	I like most Americans would long to have had a third term for Bush rather than what we have now that tries to pass as a President . 
1864	557	President of what country ? 
1865	557	Certainly not the U.S. 
1866	558	I agree . 
1867	558	Obama makes a mockery of this country and the Presidency . 
1868	558	OBAMA is the most anti-American politician in Washington . 
1869	558	OBAMA bashed our country on OBAMA World Apology Tour , and now OBAMA sides with foreign leaders against the U.S. What 's next , a Dictator Summit ? 
1870	558	OBAMA 's going to invite Ahmadinejad , Chavez , and Il to the White House to find ways AHMADINEJAD could improve AHMADINEJAD . 
1871	559	It amazes me that there are those that still think Obama has a silver tongue and is such a wonderful speaker . 
1872	559	OBAMA stutters more than Porky Pig and does n't have a prayer when PIG comes to winging PIG . 
1873	559	Even Bush puts the unman to shame . 
1874	559	Bush may have not been the greatest orator , but BUSH was a man who obviously loved and cared about America and AMERICA people , showed strength in the face of our enemies and did n't remind PEOPLE everyday that AMERICA 's all about BUSH -LRB- as Obama does -RRB- . 
1875	559	Obama does quite well doing what ??? 
1876	559	One and a half-years in office and Obama and OBAMA henchmen\/women have totally run this country into the ground with no upswing in sight . 
1877	559	If Bush or McCain were in office OUR would have already seen a recovery , North Korea would n't be the issue KOREA is today and Israel would know ISRAEL would n't have to go ISRAEL alone . 
1878	559	ASPECT_MERTEX_ all keep supporting Obama and OBAMA failed policies and know that OUR will welcome ASPECT_MERTEX_ back when the insanity is over . 
1879	560	Please get back to me when ASPECT_MERTEX_ chimpanzee learns how to pronounce Corpsman , Orion and Pock-is-stan for starters . 
1880	560	CORPSMAN 's not doing so hot , perhaps ORION 's because CORPSMAN spent much of CORPSMAN formative years growing up in the 3rd world . 
1881	560	Can one `` catch '' sickle cell ? 
1882	561	At least Bush said it the way IT was . 
1883	561	BUSH did n't try to use words to BS BUSH way around . 
1884	561	Obama 's ability to speak well , with a TelePrompTer and a speech written by a twenty-something year old , just enables OBAMA to deliver the BS to the sheeple so that they buy into what OBAMA is saying . 
1885	561	Speaking well does not imply knowledge and competence . 
1886	562	Can we just not play the mispronunciation game ? 
1887	562	GAME 's a really stupid game . 
1888	562	Anyone who does a lot of speaking is going to mess up a few words . 
1889	562	Besides I 'm pretty sure Bush has Obama beat in that area . 
1890	562	So PATH 's not exactly the wisest path to take for a conservative . 
1891	562	Focus on the policies . 
1892	562	Of which Sarah Palin has few good ones . 
1893	563	Reading with one eye or does n't EYE matter to ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ that I was responding to some Bozo playing that exact game ? 
1894	563	Try reading slower next time , ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ might keep up . 
1895	564	I was addressing everyone . 
1896	564	Boy ASPECT_NEWSMIRKINGCHIMP_ sure seem to enjoy letting the world know ASPECT_NEWSMIRKINGCHIMP_ 're arrogant . 
1897	566	ASPECT_NEWSMIRKINGCHIMP_ suppose ASPECT_NEWSMIRKINGCHIMP_ thought Bush 's pronunciation of `` nukelar '' was right up there with Palin 's lack of reading abilities ! 
1899	566	Thanks for proving once again how racist and bigoted Republican\/conservatives are . 
1900	566	ASPECT_NEWSMIRKINGCHIMP_ guess ASPECT_NEWSMIRKINGCHIMP_ are not part of the `` Compassionate Conservative '' group - oh wait , calling oneself compassionate does n't mean ASPECT_NEWSMIRKINGCHIMP_ have to be ! 
1902	567	When he could n't remember the second sentence of an adage ? 
1903	567	`` Fool HE once '' er , er , `` well , HE ca n't fool ER twice '' ! 
1905	567	BWAHAHA would have if BWAHAHA had known more words . 
1906	567	At least Obama does n't have to rely on a `` phonics '' teleprompter . 
1907	567	And , Obama did n't have to go to `` debate camp '' to learn what foreign policy meant . 
1908	567	For conservatives TELEPROMPTER does n't . 
1909	567	CONSERVATIVES are satisfied with a hockey mom , who does n't read newspapers , did n't know MOM own president 's doctrine , and writes notes on MOM hands so MOM can remember what the topic is ! 
1910	567	That is why CONSERVATIVES resent Obama , CONSERVATIVES do n't understand what OBAMA is saying - goes over CONSERVATIVES heads . 
1911	568	I would n't have used such a nice word . 
1912	569	Just to be clear , ASPECT_BFOJ_ are fine with Bush inviting Ozzie Osbourne to a White House dinner , praising OSBOURNE -LRB- Satanic -RRB- music and even admitting that OSBOURNE mom , Barbara Bush loves MUSIC too ? 
1913	569	Interesting , for someone that refers to Christianity so often in his\/her posts . 
1914	569	MOST guess there a lot of delusional conservatives who still think `` most '' Americans were fond of Bush as we kicked BUSH out of office and with a low rating to boot ! 
1915	569	MOST do n't doubt RECESSION , because it appears that conservatives do n't care what state CONSERVATIVES put the country in , whether RECESSION is a depression , recession , or toilet , as long as CONSERVATIVES have CONSERVATIVES party of `` no '' at the helm . 
1916	569	And , CONSERVATIVES continue to support CONSERVATIVES leaders , when CONSERVATIVES see that CONSERVATIVES are going against everything that is helpful to Americans . 
1917	569	Thank God for Obama . 
1918	569	MOST still believe what Romans 13 says . 
1919	570	Bush would n't deliver BS like ... -LRB- M -RRB- y budget pays down a record amount of national debt . 
1920	570	We will pay off $ 2 trillion of debt over the next decade . 
1921	570	Future generations should n't be forced to pay back money that WE have borrowed . 
1922	570	WE owe this kind of responsibility to WE children and grandchildren . 
1923	570	would he ? 
1924	573	No , I 'm correct , the Chimp is arrogant , there IS a difference . 
1925	574	ASPECT_MERTEX_ did n't see me defending Bush 's grammar did ASPECT_MERTEX_ ? 
1927	574	Nope , ME think not . 
1928	574	ME guess ASPECT_MERTEX_ were all up in arms when some idiots made a movie about Bush 's assassination ? 
1929	574	Maybe but ME kinda -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- ing doubt MOVIE . 
1930	577	ASPECT_MERTEX_ are fixated on OO , kind of like ASPECT_MERTEX_ are with BO . 
1931	577	As is BO 's fondness for the satanic religion of Islam . 
1932	577	Americans did not ` kick ' Bush out of office . 
1933	577	BUSH successfully completed BUSH two terms as President . 
1934	577	More than BO will be able to say . 
1935	577	If ASPECT_MERTEX_ look back at the last year of Bush 's 2nd term , ASPECT_MERTEX_ 'll note that the downward spiral in the financial and job situation started in September 2008 , one month after BO was nominated over Hillary . 
1936	577	It was BUSH nomination that started the run on Wall Street and Main Street as everyone with sense moved their money to safer environs because of THEIR concern for an Obama Presidency and BUSH radical ideas . 
1937	577	We are now reaping the fruit -LRB- or more likely weeds -RRB- of BUSH unleadership and denunciation of America . 
1938	577	Oh , yes . 
1939	577	As part of God 's Plan , BO is an instrumental figure , but not the way ASPECT_MERTEX_ might think . 
1940	577	PART 's preparing WE for the anti-christ . 
1941	578	Perhaps on the planet Bizarro . 
1942	579	He only seems arrogant to those who do n't understand what HE says , not really HE fault , but the difference here is that Obama has a brain . 
1943	580	Bush could never compare to Obama in eloquence . 
1944	580	Poor Bush , had to have BUSH phonics teleprompter , and still BUSH could n't pronounce the words right . 
1945	580	The criticism from the right just shows what sore losers LOSERS are . 
1946	580	Now that is an understatement . 
1947	580	Sure BUSH did , that is why BUSH did n't mind disregarding the Constitution and telling us BUSH was `` the decider '' ? 
1948	580	That was n't strength - CONSTITUTION was ignorance . 
1949	580	Have n't ASPECT_BFOJ_ heard the phrase `` Ignorance is bliss . '' 
1950	580	Putting the interests of people ahead of the interests of corporations , unlike Bush\/Cheney . 
1951	580	Er , excuse ME , the country was already run into the ground by the time Obama took over , and for that we can thank Bush , the one that some conservatives still give OBAMA a pass on . 
1952	580	If Bush or McCain were in office WE would n't be posting on this forum , the country would be so deep into depression ASPECT_BFOJ_ would have had to sell ASPECT_BFOJ_ computer to buy bread . 
1953	580	How can the same policies that drove the country into the toilet take COUNTRY out ? 
1954	580	Only warped conservative thinking can come up with crap like that . 
1955	580	No , Bush would have WE in a war with Korea , making WE soldiers deploy there after serving in Iraq and Afghanistan without a break . 
1956	580	Israel is well equipped to take care of ISRAEL . 
1957	580	Why do conservatives feel like WE have to babysit Israel ? 
1958	580	Welcome ME back ? 
1959	580	ME 'm not going anywhere . 
1960	580	And that was n't Obama 's policies that failed , those were Bush 's . 
1961	580	Conservative have short memories , ME guess THOSE are now going to say that Bush actually increased the Surplus and was n't responsible for the loss of thousands of our soldiers , not to mention Iraqi citizens . 
1962	581	Gosh , OBAMA are the Obama `` model citizen . '' 
1963	581	Anybody that does n't agree with Obama is stupid . 
1964	581	CITIZEN mean because no conservative has a brain . 
1965	581	At some point he needs to stop mocking people and actually answer some questions . 
1966	581	How long has POINT been since HE 's done a press conference ? 
1967	584	The country lived through FDR and re-elected FDR three times . 
1968	584	I seriously doubt that any individual president could create more harm to the United States than FDR . 
1969	585	FDR came in with the worst depression in history , turned the economy around and won a world war . 
1970	585	Bush came in with a surplus budget , left the worst recession since then and got us in a mistaken war . 
1971	585	Not even close . 
1972	586	I understand rabid partisanship . 
1973	587	A swipe at a President with a disability ? 
1974	587	Though I think FDR 's social implementations were a misappropriation of funds and failed reasoning , I happen to admire the man who stood up to Japan and Germany attempts to conquer the world . 
1975	587	Obama ai n't no FDR !!! 
1976	587	Our radical Islamic enemies will not be stood up against by this weak-kneed , wimp President of today . 
1977	587	Even Jimmy Carter would be an improvement . 
1978	588	By the way , I enjoyed ASPECT_IRIEMON_ post of 9-15-2009 . 
1979	589	Maybe he should invade Morocco or something to make ASPECT_BFOJ_ feel better . 
1980	589	After we pay for the $ 1 trillion debt from the Iraq mistake . 
1981	590	all the liberals want the end to the wars too if ASPECT_SHIVA_TD_ check out the news and commentaries . 
1982	590	i think he 's just there for bipartisanship ? 
1983	590	maybe if HE announces a pull out before HE cycle is over HE will get re elected . 
1984	590	that would be good politics , lets say the republicans get the majority then HE announces and end to the wars and they say no. . 
1985	590	any incumbent who does n't follow suit will lose out on independents for the republican nomination and this will be a victory for us . 
1986	591	How about the many trillions in debt that Obama has racked up since coming into office ? 
1987	592	While about 70 House Democrats opposed the surge in Afghanistan overwhelmingly both Democrats and Republicans supported 70 . 
1988	592	We can also note that during the 2008 primaries that all of the presidential candidates except for Kucinich and Paul supported the continued US wars in the Middle East to a greater or lessor degree . 
1989	593	I bet ASPECT_IRIEMON_ do ... LOL 
1990	594	It does n't count if Obama spends IT . 
1991	594	Remember OBAMA has OBAMA own currency called `` Obama money . '' 
1992	595	Measuring in trillions of dollars is somewhat hard to determine for several reasons . 
1993	595	First and foremost is that while a president does have influence the budget is actually established by Congress and not the president . 
1994	595	Next is the fact that the 2009 budget is a Bush budget and not an Obama budget although Obama did add some spending to SPENDING . 
1995	595	By comparison though in 8 years President Bush doubled the national debt and even with projected average deficits of almost a trillion dollars per year President Obama will not double the national debt that 8 inherited from the Bush adminstration even if 8 remains in office for 8 years . 
1996	596	ASPECT_SHIVA_TD_ seem to be confusing what ASPECT_SHIVA_TD_ want , with what independents want . 
1997	596	What independents actually like and do n't like is simple . 
1998	596	There are many politically sophisticated independents , but most independents are not . 
1999	596	Most do n't know much about politics , and do n't really care to . 
2000	596	So for the most part independents dislike taxes on INDEPENDENTS . 
2001	596	Whether INDEPENDENTS are ok with taxes on other people is more mixed , but taxes on INDEPENDENTS are always opposed . 
2002	596	INDEPENDENTS are in favor of government programs that INDEPENDENTS can clearly tell benefit INDEPENDENTS . 
2003	596	So INDEPENDENTS tend to like social security , medicaid , etc. . 
2004	596	INDEPENDENTS tend to dislike programs that clearly directly benefit other people , but not PEOPLE . 
2005	596	Most do n't care about the drug war , but the ones who do are probably relatively evenly split , with people opposed to the drug war probably a slight majority . 
2006	596	ONES might care a little about national debt and a balanced budget , but LITTLE is certainly not at the forefront of ONES mind . 
2007	596	ONES definitely DO N'T want to end the war on terror , and ONES may want a rational immigration policy , but not people who feel -LRB- however justified or unjustified that feeling is -RRB- that immigrants are a threat to IMMIGRANTS jobs . 
2008	596	I agree with almost every aspect of what ASPECT_SHIVA_TD_ said , to make DO clear that I am not simply disagreeing with ASPECT_SHIVA_TD_ for partisan reasons , but most independents DO NOT . 
2009	596	INDEPENDENTS may agree with a few of those points , but INDEPENDENTS are certainly not in complete agreement on any of those points . 
2010	598	Or maybe they interpreted it as , `` will ASPECT_JOHNNY_DANGEROUSLY_ vote for Obama if ASPECT_JOHNNY_DANGEROUSLY_ have to vote for one of the 2 main parties , and Sarah Palin was the Republican candidate . '' 
2011	598	Then ASPECT_JOHNNY_DANGEROUSLY_ would vote yes . 
2012	598	As IT stands , ASPECT_JOHNNY_DANGEROUSLY_ will be voting 3rd party in the 2012 election , or not voting at all . 
2013	599	I 'd be very interested to see any polls showing that independents want to cut military , SS , medicare and medicaid spending by any significant amount . 
2014	600	I would vote against Obama if Bonzo the Chimp were running . 
2015	600	I might possibly abstain if CHOICE were a choice between Obama and Charlie Manson , but otherwise anyone who stands even a remote chance of beating this loser and getting LOSER and LOSER thugs out of the WH will get I vote ... 
2016	601	Most independents that I have heard from want a balanced budget without tax increases and that would mandate cuts in both military and entitlement budgets because there is no other way to achieve a balanced budget . 
2017	601	People are delusional if PEOPLE believe that cutting $ 15-20 billion in pork barrel spending will eliminate a trillion dollar annual deficit and I do n't believe that independents are that delusional . 
2018	601	PEOPLE know what needs to be cut even though PEOPLE are probably calling for cuts in programs PEOPLE support in principle . 
2019	602	Thanks , but I 'll pass on giving credence to ASPECT_SHIVA_TD_ anecdotal hearsay as to what independents supposedly want . 
2020	603	President Obama possesses no skill or guidance set with which to command , no knowledge base with which to govern , and no ideological base that is consistent with a republic and capitalism . 
2021	603	As anyone would conjecture , OBAMA has looked moronic in OBAMA vain attempts to be the world 's unifier . 
2022	603	Obama promised the most transparent administration in U.S. history despite the fact OBAMA broke numerous campaign promises . 
2023	603	It is blatantly obvious that OBAMA administration is in over ADMINISTRATION head and is governing in an sophomoric , incompetent manner . 
2024	603	I would vote against Obama if Pee Wee Herman were running for the Presidency . 
2025	604	This nonsensical assertion does n't nullify or exculpate the Obama administration 's lugubrious fiscal immaturity , wasteful spending like allocating nearly $ 20 million dollars courtesy the Obama stimulus to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program -LRB- Food Stamps -RRB- , $ 89 billion to provide a temporary increase in Medicaid funding that neglects to promote or stimulate job growth . 
2026	604	President Obama disclosed a $ 3.55 trillion budget for fiscal year 2010 and projects a deficit of $ 1.75 trillion dollars . 
2027	604	The authorization of out of control , irresponsible and reckless deficit and debt spending at unprecedented rates indicates hideous leadership and a lack of fiscal responsibility by President Obama and a pathetic led Democratic controlled Congress . 
2028	604	Come 2012 , President Obama will have added over 5 + trillion dollars to The National Debt in just 4 short years . 
2029	605	My intent was not to `` nullify or exculpate the Obama administration 's lugubrious fiscal immaturity '' but instead to reflect the fact that the problem is bipartisan in nature . 
2030	607	http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/story\/0,2933,558700,00.htmlAs I have noted the national debt is an overwhelming concern for most independents and it is the independents who ultimately elect the president as neither the Republicans or the Democrats have enough votes to elect anyone without the support of the independents . 
2031	607	BTW this is an older poll and the concerns about the debt have increased since the passage of the HCR bill which most independents opposed because of PRICETAG 's trillion dollar pricetag . 
2032	607	I do n't doubt the national debt is an overwhelming concern . 
2033	607	What I doubted was the most independent would favor significant cuts in military , SS , medicare and medicaid spending . 
2034	608	It 's estimated overhauling health care will cost nearly $ 1-1 .2 trillion dollars further adding to a sky rocketing National Debt and the interest payment on The National Debt , two of America 's largest expenditures . 
2035	608	Furthermore , Obama proposes cutting approximately $ 500 billion dollars from Medicare depriving the the disabled , the handicapped , the mentally ill and our senior citizens access to quality health care service . 
2036	608	One of the primaries goals of passing `` Obamacare '' is to drive down health care costs , however Medicare\/Medicaid and the interest payment on the National Debt are without question some of OUR government 's biggest liabilities . 
2037	608	Eventually , the total cost of overhauling `` Obamacare '' will surpass rising health care costs based on the premise that the the payments of Medicare\/Medicaid and the interest payment on The National Debt will exceed overhauling `` Obamacare `` ObamaCare will increase nation 's healthcare costs . 
2039	609	That is less than 1\/4 the cost of additional military spending since 2000 . 
2040	609	So THAT assume ASPECT_REDRUM_ 're in favor of drastic cuts in military spending too , right ? 
2041	610	And I want a time machine and a unicorn . 
2042	611	And back on earth where Obama is just another politician , such things sound like nonsense . 
2043	611	I ca n't believe conservatives actually believe the things CONSERVATIVES say . 
2044	611	I believe Obama has not been a good president , but the way conservatives talk Obama is Hitler , Stalin , and Mao rapped up into one . 
2045	611	That is of course complete and total nonsense . 
2046	611	Obama is just like most other Democratic or Republican politicians , which is to say incompetent and ruled over by the interests that finance OBAMA campaigns and lobby OBAMA on a daily basis . 
2047	611	Anyone who thinks a Republican would be any better is delusional , and anyone who thinks POLITICIANS would be that much worse is also delusional . 
2048	612	Yes , WAR support massive cuts in military spending like putting an end to that `` war of necessity '' , the Afghanistan conflict President Obama once labeled . 
2050	612	It was the Democrats who passed Medicare\/Medicaid in 1965 and now a majority of Democrats propose cutting nearly $ 500 million dollars from that government operated health care plan . 
2051	612	Sorry Iriemon , that logic is fundamentally erroneous . 
2052	613	Why are ASPECT_REDRUM_ calling Iriemon frodly ? 
2054	613	I see ASPECT_REDRUM_ fixed PS now !! 
2055	614	Barrack Hussein Obama , a incompetent President with invidious and enigmatic acquaintances who manipulated millions of Americans based on asinine promises of hope , change and transparency . 
2056	614	OBAMA is nothing more than a self loathing duplicitous progressive Left elitist , equipped with no moral compass . 
2057	614	President Obama : Sharp as a bowling ball ... 
2058	615	No actually McCain , Pelosi , Reid , et al are each `` just another politician '' . 
2059	615	This guy happens to be sitting in the office of what was formerly -LRB- until GUY go ahold of AL and started apolgizing around the world for America 's `` arrogance and injustices '' -RRB- known as the Leader of the Free World . 
2060	615	Look , POLITICIAN 'm not going to argue with ASPECT_FRODLY_ about the motivation of our current politicians . 
2061	615	POLITICIAN completely agree that POLITICIANS are -LRB- on both sides of the aisle -RRB- motivated pretty much solely by what 's in AISLE for POLITICIANS . 
2062	615	That said , Obama is NOT like most other politicians . 
2063	615	OBAMA sees OBAMA as some sort of revolutionary who is going to `` make America a better place to live '' by injecting massive amounts of government into OUR lives and righting the `` injustices '' suffered by minorities , gays , the poor , and just about any other voting bloc OBAMA thinks OBAMA can pander to and that might be stupid enough to swallow the prodigious piles of dog poo that spews from OBAMA mouth on a daily basis . 
2064	615	Most other politicians are satisfied with sitting in POLITICIANS little offices and filling POLITICIANS greedy little pockets as POLITICIANS build POLITICIANS petty little fiefdoms within the gubment . 
2065	615	ASPECT_FRODLY_ may want to go back and read POLITICIAN original post . 
2066	615	Not once do POLITICIAN mention a Republican . 
2067	615	POLITICIAN primary point was that POLITICIAN am aware of this man 's agenda and POINT 's dangerous . 
2068	615	MAN 's attempting to make fundamental changes in this country that POLITICIAN do n't agree with . 
2069	615	POLITICIAN 'm willing to take POLITICIAN chances on just about any other warm body that can fog a mirror if POLITICIAN think there 's a remote possibility they wo n't do as much damage to this country as Obama is trying to do . 
2070	615	Hell , POLITICIAN 'd even vote for Hillary if POLITICIAN were able to vote in a Demoratic primary and if DEMORATIC ran as an independent POLITICIAN 'd vote for DEMORATIC over Obama in the general if POLITICIAN though the Republican candidate did n't have a chance of winning -LRB- doubtful running against Obama , but ... -RRB- . 
2071	615	Not only that ... OBAMA 's black -LRB- gratuitous bone thrown as chum to the lib trolls out there , POLITICIAN 've been called a racist enough POLITICIAN figure POLITICIAN might as well just embrace the title -RRB- 
2072	616	Absolutely not . 
2073	616	Obama uses rhetoric and tries to pretend that OBAMA is different from most other politicians , but the fact is OBAMA is n't . 
2074	616	What has Obama done that is so radical ? 
2075	616	The radical solution to healthcare is socialized medicine like POLITICIANS have in the UK . 
2076	616	The center left solution was a public option like POLITICIANS have in many other European countries . 
2077	616	What we wound up with was a compromise that benefited no one but insurance companies , who now have people mandated to buy insurance . 
2078	616	A handout to insurance companies , does n't seem to radical to me . 
2079	616	Not only that , but the mandate was originally Hillary 's idea , the person ASPECT_JOHNNY_DANGEROUSLY_ say ASPECT_JOHNNY_DANGEROUSLY_ would vote for over Obama . 
2080	616	Beyond that , what has Obama done that is radical ? 
2081	616	OBAMA continued both wars . 
2082	616	OBAMA hired Bush and Clinton era economic advisers . 
2083	616	OBAMA is anything but radical . 
2084	616	Well ME take that back , OBAMA is a radical centrist . 
2085	616	Well since ME am not one of those liberals , how about ASPECT_JOHNNY_DANGEROUSLY_ do n't ? 
2086	617	Not only no. ... BUT HELL FRICKEN NO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
2087	618	Who did ASPECT_AGENT_ZERO_ vote for last election ? 
2088	618	And why ? 
2089	619	Obama money = our tax dollars + $ 0 -LRB- amount non-taxpayers contribute -RRB- 
2090	620	Actually , Obama has tripled the deficit in 1.5 years -LRB- per projection -RRB- . 
2091	620	I do agree that the Congress manages the purse strings , but the President signs CONGRESS . 
2092	620	Let 's see , the Democrats were in office during the last 2 years of the Bush Administration and that 's when the lid exploded , even more so after investors bailed out of the Stock Market when BO got the Dem nomination in August 2008 . 
2093	621	I appreciate ASPECT_FRODLY_ vote or non-vote helping remove Obama from office in 2012 . 
2094	622	My intent is to reflect the fact that Obama is above OBAMA paygrade . 
2095	623	Check the facts . 
2096	623	Our military forces and apparatrus has been significantly reduced since Bush I. Really took a beating under Clinton and now under Obama . 
2097	623	The Federal Government has grown massively under Obama at the expense of private employment . 
2098	624	And I support ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ wants . 
2099	624	Ride that unicorn into a time warp , PLEASE !!! 
2100	625	I appreciate ASPECT_BFOJ_ vote or non-vote helping remove Obama from office in 2012 . 
2101	625	Some choose to vote for the best candidate as opposed to voting for the lessor of two evils . 
2102	625	In 2008 neither the Republicans or the Democrats nominated a candidate worthy of being president . 
2103	625	We can expect the same in 2012 . 
2105	626	Sucks do n't it ? 
2106	628	Could n't be more truthful . 
2107	629	While MY will not be voting for Obama in 2012 , my no vote will be irrelevant . 
2108	629	Because of the electoral college , Obama will get MY vote no matter what MY do , because OBAMA will , without question , win Illinois . 
2109	629	Not only will OBAMA win Illinois , but OBAMA will win reelection as well . 
2110	629	The frenzied insanity Obama has caused in right wingers in this country is not shared by the vast majority of people . 
2111	629	Non-political people still like Obama . 
2112	629	PEOPLE count for a lot in a presidential election . 
2113	629	But much more importantly , Obama will win because by 2012 , the economy will have rebounded . 
2114	629	Now that simply has to do with the nature of the business cycle , but because of the nature of politics Obama will claim the credit , and OBAMA will win reelection . 
2115	629	Another important reason Obama will win , is because Republicans are REALLY -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- !! 
2116	629	They are incredibly incompetent , so even if Obama is incompetent as well , INCOMPETENT is not like anyone but Republican partisans think a Republican would be that much better . 
2117	630	Yes , could n't be more truthful . 
2118	630	Except if ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ count reality in ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ evaluation of truth . 
2119	630	If only the land of right wing fairy tales is counted , then yes `` could n't be more truthful . '' 
2120	630	But if ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ allow that pesky reality business to get in the way , BUSINESS could n't be less truthful . 
2121	630	Meaning BUSINESS is n't truthful at all . 
2122	630	http:\/\/www.govexec.com\/dailyfed\/0108\/020708cdam1.htmDefense spending was at BILLION 's high point under George HW Bush in 1990 . 
2123	630	BILLION was 301 billion . 
2124	630	If adjusted for inflation , that would be 495 billion in todays dollars . 
2125	630	Defense spending in W. Bush 's last budget was 680 billion . 
2126	630	Significantly more than the spending was the last year of the cold war !! 
2127	630	So yes , if ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ discount reality TRUTHFUL suppose that could n't be more truthful . 
2128	630	But being the crazy liberal that TRUTHFUL am , TRUTHFUL like to reference reality when deciding how truthful a statement is . 
2129	630	So TRUTHFUL will say the statement `` could n't be more truthful '' actually could n't be less truthful . 
2130	631	Very well said . 
2131	632	Not no , but hell no. . 
2132	632	I did not vote for his America hating leftist loser imbicilic incompetent moronic simpleton ass the first time when I thought HIS was all these things and more , now I know HIS is all these things and more . 
2133	632	Not no , but hell no. . 
2134	633	Maybe he will get offered the secretary of the Navy post , like Sestak . 
2135	634	Duh ... . 
2137	634	. fricking obvious ... duh ... . 
2139	635	ITS called wishy washy duplicity ... . 
2140	635	its a leftist thing ... . 
2141	635	nothing like waiting to see which way the wind blows before setting ASPECT_RAPUNZEL_ sails . 
2142	636	I 'm only 18 , so I did n't vote in the last election . 
2143	637	I thought ASPECT_FRODLY_ lived in the U.S. I do n't recognize the the country as ASPECT_FRODLY_ describe , particularly the non-political people who 's numbers are dwindling daily because of Obama 's incompetence . 
2144	637	By the way , Illinois will go Republican in 2010 and 2012 , big time . 
2145	638	Certainly not if Obama runs , which OBAMA will . 
2146	639	ASPECT_FRODLY_ refer to Defense spending , I referred to the size of our Military . 
2147	639	Perhaps a little more research on ASPECT_FRODLY_ part will enlighten ASPECT_FRODLY_ . 
2148	640	The odds are that Obama will not run for reelection for OBAMA may be incompetent but OBAMA is no fool . 
2149	640	OBAMA sees the writing on the wall and OBAMA will not want to be ashamed of failing to get reelected . 
2150	640	Still ca n't understand why OBAMA does n't mind failing in matters of importance like running the country and being a strong advocate for America . 
2151	640	My money is on Hillary to run , then get stomped in the general election . 
2152	640	Does n't matter which Republican will run against HILLARY . 
2154	641	Are his poll numbers so different than other Presidents in this stage in the game ? 
2155	641	And , for the record , the last time a President declined to run for a second term was in 1968 ... 
2156	642	He is already a disgrace , who cares about HE shame that deepens each day to never before seen depths and depravity . 
2157	642	Hillary will run , I 'm sure , but I hope that the GOP will be wise enough to not nominate Palin , HILLARY is attractive and strong to a degree , but presidential material , HILLARY pars Obama in that respect . 
2158	643	He will run , I disagree with BFOJ in that regard . 
2159	643	Obama is an arogent ass , OBAMA thinks unequivocately that OBAMA is right , even though a clear majority was against the health care bill , for example , the leftists passed ASS anyway . 
2160	643	I am not sure OBAMA will get out of the primaries though , Hillary looks better all the time , but leftists are stupid and LEFTISTS will stick with LEFTISTS man even though OBAMA is an obvious leftist loser and an incompetent boob . 
2161	644	The question will be whether the Republicans put up even greater losers than McCain and Palin in 2012 ? 
2162	644	Even my parents , life long Republicans from Arizona , could n't bring PARENTS to vote for the McCain\/Palin ticket . 
2163	645	I agree , I had to hold I nose while I did NOSE . 
2164	645	I would have voted for Hillary if HILLARY had be the nomonee . 
2165	645	HILLARY is a better canidate than McCain , and CANIDATE would hve been the first time voting for a Dem since Carter . 
2166	645	I knew that Obama would be a buffoon from the very moment I saw OBAMA on a stage in Iowa . 
2167	645	I was shooked that OBAMA got the ticket , much less that people actually elected OBAMA , TICKET defies logic . 
2168	645	I hope and pray that people will not make the same mistake twice . 
2169	646	ASPECT_FRODLY_ have a valid point , the public is horribly ignorant , and that 's how we wound up with him in the first place . 
2170	646	One thing though , the Democrats can not lean back on much , the people are decidedly against HIM health care and that is going to be big , as well as immigration just look at the Arizona numbers , the country is scared to death of the immigration situation . 
2171	646	I think that will play big as well . 
2172	646	The fact that HIM does not listen . 
2173	646	HIM has also caused a greater divide between the races , and HIM is not going to get the white support HIM once enjoyed . 
2174	646	Now , ASPECT_FRODLY_ putting NOW all in the economy and that 's a real strong point , NOW will improve and no thanks to HIM and HIM will play on NOW . 
2175	646	I truly believe if HIM continues to lose the independents HIM 's gone . 
2176	646	The last part of ASPECT_FRODLY_ post I will dismiss , pure partisan bull . 
2177	646	We are talking about the public and not ASPECT_FRODLY_ particular take on the republicans . 
2178	646	Look at Congress a horrible situation , and there is nothing partisan about that . 
2179	648	Given the depraved fools who put George Bush in office twice , OFFICE 's hard to argue against the point . 
2181	649	Less pecimistically -LRB- sp -RRB- , I do not think that people will make this horendous a mistake again for awhile . 
2182	649	I think that many people have awakened to the fact that character and associations matter . 
2183	649	If CHARACTER gets re-elected , I will defere to this post as highly prophetic and never doubt ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ again . 
2184	649	I hope , whoever , that ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ are very wrong on this score . 
2185	649	If CHARACTER is re-elected , SCORE may well be the end of our republic as OUR now know NOW , and a clear diviation from the founders intent . 
2186	650	Good point . 
2188	651	Given that Obama 's approval ratings are hovering in the 45-50 % range even in the midst of the worst economy in 80 years , IMO ASPECT_BFOJ_ 're reaching . 
2189	652	Those numbers make onalandline 's point . 
2190	652	That people have not fully realized the disaster that is Obama and OBAMA merry band of leftists . 
2191	652	Katrina and the oil spill , personified . 
2192	653	lol ASPECT_BFOJ_ are way too far gone if ASPECT_BFOJ_ think one of Obama 's homestates is going republican in 2012 . 
2193	654	In other words , ASPECT_BFOJ_ have no idea what ASPECT_BFOJ_ are talking about . 
2194	654	I pointed out ASPECT_BFOJ_ ignorance of the subject , and ASPECT_BFOJ_ have no response . 
2195	656	I sometimes wonder how people can both work a computer and continue to say things as stupid as this . 
2196	656	Obama will win Illinois in 2012 . 
2197	656	I will bet ASPECT_BFOJ_ through pay pal . 
2198	656	Not only will I bet ASPECT_BFOJ_ , but I will give ASPECT_BFOJ_ 10-1 odds as well . 
2199	656	That is because Obama will win Illinois . 
2200	656	ILLINOIS is not even up for debate . 
2201	657	What DEMOCRAT said was partisan ???? 
2202	657	DEMOCRAT said Republicans were incompetent -LRB- they are -RRB- and DEMOCRAT said Democrats are incompetent . 
2203	657	Which side was DEMOCRAT partisan for ? 
2204	657	Simply pointing out how absolutely terrible the Republican party is , is not partisan unless DEMOCRAT did it only because DEMOCRAT was a Democrat . 
2205	657	DEMOCRAT am not , DEMOCRAT think Democrats are almost as bad if not equally as bad . 
2206	658	Good lord what the hell are ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ guys talking about ?? 
2207	658	Obama is not significantly worse than George Bush . 
2208	658	If ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ think OBAMA is , ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ are delusional . 
2209	658	Obama has been a bad president -LRB- in my opinion -RRB- , but no worse than George Bush . 
2210	658	The insane hyperbole coming from the right , in which they try to pretend that Obama is the worst leader since Stalin , is simply insanity . 
2211	659	ASPECT_FRODLY_ have totally , and I mean totally , missed the point . 
2212	660	No I did n't . 
2213	660	EXAMPLE was an example of an ignorant person decrying how terrible Obama is , and how terrible the electorate is that elected OBAMA . 
2214	660	The person who wrote that statement is clearly a fool as well , as evidenced by what they wrote . 
2215	660	I bet that is one of those internet chainmails going about . 
2216	660	Where really stupid people go on and on about who stupid or foolish Obama is . 
2217	660	Obama is certainly not stupid or foolish . 
2218	660	OBAMA is actually very bright . 
2219	660	OBAMA is simply an incompetent president , and like all other politicians , OBAMA is more worried about pleasing OBAMA campaign financiers and lobbyists , than OBAMA is about doing what is best for this country . 
2220	661	She is right in both cases . 
2221	661	Obama is the poster child for imbicilic incompetence , and the people totally ignored OBAMA being mentored politically at a young age by a self identified communist , and spiritually mentored by an America hating racist non-christian preacher , have COMMUNIST political career launched at the home of a murderous domestic terrorist . 
2222	661	How much evidence do ASPECT_FRODLY_ fricking need . 
2223	661	If ASPECT_FRODLY_ can not see the magnificent examples of OBAMA incompetence flowing freely from the white house daily then FRIEND , my young friend , are in desperate need of an awakening . 
2224	661	OBAMA is both stupid and foolish added to OBAMA incompetence and corruption and collusion and other criminalities is pleaseing no one . 
2225	661	But MY have never been fooled by this idiot . 
2227	661	INCOMPETENCE is beyond MY why anyone misses INCOMPETENCE , INCOMPETENCE is so obvious . 
2228	662	If IDEOLOGUE are a right wing ideologue , yes . 
2229	662	For all sensible people , what ASPECT_NEVER_LEFT_ are saying is nonsense . 
2230	663	ASPECT_FRODLY_ know nothing about my ideology , pretending ASPECT_FRODLY_ do is foolish . 
2231	663	MY oppose Obama on principle , because OBAMA has none . 
2232	664	We survived FDR who deviated from the Constitution more than any other president in history and was the original architect behind the national debt that WE have today . 
2233	664	Yes , FDR was added to by LBJ in the ' 60 's and by several presidents who have squandered America 's wealth on military interventionism over the last 60 years but FDR was the first and worst president when FDR came to complete distain for a constitutionally limited government . 
2234	665	While the debt has increased in actual terms , relative to GDP , DEBT declined steadily , including during LBJ 's term until 1981.Year-Debt % GDP1946 121.0 % 1947 105.7 % 1948 93.6 % 1949 94.7 % 1950 87.5 % 1951 75.2 % 1952 72.3 % 1953 70.1 % 1954 73.3 % 1955 67.7 % 1956 63.3 % 1957 59.6 % 1958 60.4 % 1959 57.2 % 1960 55.1 % 1961 54.3 % 1962 51.7 % 1963 50.0 % 1964 47.8 % 1965 44.6 % 1966 41.8 % 1967 41.4 % 1968 39.3 % 1969 37.4 % 1970 37.5 % 1971 37.6 % 1972 36.3 % 1973 34.0 % 1974 32.8 % 1975 35.2 % 1976 35.8 % 1977 35.4 % 1978 34.4 % 1979 33.0 % 1980 33.4 % 1981 32.9 % 1982 36.8 % 1983 39.9 % 1984 42.3 % 1985 46.1 % 1986 47.6 % 1987 49.6 % 1988 51.0 % 1989 52.1 % 1990 55.7 % 1991 61.2 % 1992 64.1 % 1993 66.2 % 
2235	666	Well , that is true . 
2236	666	Perhaps THAT was being a little melodramatic . 
2237	666	But the point remains that Obama has made few , if any , good decisions . 
2238	666	And those came at much deliberation and consternation shelled within OBAMA inability to make a decision that is driven by principle , OBAMA seeks consencus to even simple things , let alone hard things . 
2239	666	Take the oil spill for instance , OBAMA is pushing SPILL all off on BP . 
2240	666	which is not wrong , but OBAMA has taken no leadership role in this disaster , instead of getting skimmer recources here as quickly as possible , OBAMA placed ROLE all on hold for God only knows what reason , where RECOURCES could have been getting as much oil as possible from the open water mitigateing the amount that reached shore making impact and cleanup more manageable . 
2241	666	As ROLE is , the disaster is maximized and the efforts of prevention minimized . 
2242	666	ROLE an Obama thing . 
2243	667	Well , we have no idea who the Repubs will run , or how they will perform , but WE do have the Dems in office now so an opinion can be given . 
2244	667	So , I would have to assume ASPECT_FRODLY_ are being bias at the very least . 
2245	667	I liked the rest of ASPECT_FRODLY_ post though ... I may not agree but ASPECT_FRODLY_ presented the point well . 
2246	668	Yes , the field is wide open . 
2247	668	I do not see Palin doing well . 
2248	668	People float her name for now , even though HER has not declared , because no other names are out there . 
2249	668	But there are alot of quality republicans out there who would do well . 
2250	668	Palin to I is like Obama , looks good , speakes well , but has no depth or experience . 
2251	668	However from the hip , even Palin out shines Barry . 
2252	668	But that is no achievement of note . 
2253	669	The only guy who manages to poll well against Obama is Romney . 
2254	669	And I have strong doubts a Mormon will ever get nominated . 
2255	669	As long as there is a halfway decent Christian on the table like Mike Huckabee Romney does n't stand a chance . 
2256	670	ASPECT_GOLDWATER_ figures are backward . 
2257	670	No one can suggest this forum is overwhelmingly conservative . 
2258	670	Who are ASPECT_GOLDWATER_ kidding ? 
2259	671	If a Muslim can get nominated and win the Presidency , then a Mormon has a chance . 
2260	672	Of course ASPECT_BFOJ_ can . 
2261	672	The conservative claim the board is full of liberals . 
2262	672	The liberals claim the board is full of conservatives . 
2263	672	And the libertarians claim the board is full of idiots . 
2264	675	Humm , could be . 
2265	675	I like them both , and I liked either compared to McCain , whom I admire , just not as president , MCCAIN is too much a RINO for I taste . 
2266	675	But I think that Jindal will be in the mix , and in this present crisis in the gulf JINDAL outshines Obama , but admittedly , thats not hard to do . 
2267	675	But yet JINDAL has exercised leadership in the vacuum left by Obama 's incompetence . 
2268	675	People need to get over the religion thing . 
2269	675	Wer have a closet Muslim in there now , how much worse could a good Mormon family man be ? 
2270	676	... he never intended to ... 
2271	677	There is no one in the whole of the known and unknow universe as far as Hubble may peer , who is more incompetent than Obama . 
2272	677	ONE is an absolute impossibility . 
2273	677	Off the scale even . 
2274	678	That 's funny . 
2275	678	The Republican 's own website does n't show a majority against the health care bill . 
2276	678	In fact , it seems to show just the opposite ; that the health care bill did n't go far enough . 
2277	678	And THAT all know why OPPOSITE did n't go far enough : Republican obstructionism . 
2278	679	Just now noticing that huh ? 
2279	680	Please tell me the name and location of ASPECT_BFOJ_ doctor . 
2280	680	ME want what DOCTOR is prescribing . 
2281	681	Obama and I have the same doctor . 
2282	681	The doctor likes to have patients that counter-balance one another . 
2283	681	ASPECT_RSAY32_ 're either for I or ASPECT_RSAY32_ 're against I . 
2284	682	It all makes sense to me now . 
2285	682	On ME personal hotline to the oval office , Obama told ME OBAMA was planning to research the plague of hallucinatory pyschoses afflicting Republicans . 
2286	683	ASPECT_RSAY32_ actually were n't speaking with Obama , it was Gibbs . 
2287	683	Speaking of one who suffers from hallucinatory psychosis , now that man 's picture is in the dictionary for this phrase . 
2288	684	ASPECT_BFOJ_ delusional fixation on Obama does not reflect reality . 
2289	684	Obama will win Illinois , and I would bet ASPECT_BFOJ_ any sum of money to that effect . 
2290	685	When a Muslim does get nominated , please let me know . 
2291	686	Bush is the poster child for imbecilic incompetence . 
2292	686	BUSH did more harm to our country by acting like a bully and bragging about torturing OUR prisoners . 
2293	686	OUR grandchildren and great grandchildren will be the ones to pay for BUSH stupidity.Right-wingers saw what BUSH administration did to OUR country , yet ONES have the audacity to get on here and criticize Obama , who kept OUR from going into depression , in spite of having to work with Republican Congressmen who vote no on every issue . 
2294	686	OUR are so fortunate that the majority of people in America were able to see the ignorance of the Republican Party play out and decided OUR had had enough of PEOPLE incompetence . 
2295	686	Conservatives keep repeating the lies of the conservative media , who 's main interest is having the Republican party in office so CONSERVATIVES can get tax cuts and get wealthier on the back of hard working people . 
2296	686	And the dummies that watch CONSERVATIVES programs are believing everything DUMMIES tell DUMMIES , because DUMMIES are not smart enough to figure out that WEALTHIER is all a bunch of lies . 
2297	686	If conservatives were able to take CONSERVATIVES bigoted racists blinders off , CONSERVATIVES might be able to see that everything the conservative media tells CONSERVATIVES is just a bunch of BS . 
2298	686	CONSERVATIVES do n't like Obama because OBAMA is black and mostly because OBAMA makes Bush and Cheney look like Dumb and Dumber . 
2299	687	I 'm not sure what his doctor is prescribing is good . 
2300	687	It makes ASPECT_RSAY32_ lunatic , do ASPECT_RSAY32_ actually want to subscribe to that ? 
2301	688	How do ASPECT_BFOJ_ figure that . 
2302	688	Check any of the polls - it is most certainly mostly rightist ! 
2303	688	Most of the mods are conservative , so explain that . 
2304	689	That is funny that ASPECT_BFOJ_ should say that . 
2305	689	US 'm having a discussion with another conservative who argues that the right wing is not trying to dictate religion into government and , that Separation of Church and State is a myth . 
2306	689	THAT claims that the FF did not intend for a specific religion , but certainly wanted religion into government . 
2307	689	Now , ASPECT_BFOJ_ explain to US , if that is the case , why would the right wing get their panties all in a wad if WING had been true that Obama was Muslim ? 
2308	689	After all , we do have Muslims living here in the US and THEIR pay taxes . 
2309	689	THEMSELVES , by ASPECT_BFOJ_ statement have just proven that right-wingers who call themselves Christian do n't practice what RIGHT-WINGERS preach . 
2310	689	RIGHT-WINGERS want to dictate RIGHT-WINGERS beliefs to everyone else in the country , by law , if RIGHT-WINGERS can , and RIGHT-WINGERS do n't want to extend certain rights to other citizens . 
2311	689	True Christians would want to be fair , would n't RIGHT-WINGERS ? 
2312	690	So I win if he does n't run for reelection ? 
2313	690	I do n't bet , certainly not for money . 
2314	690	There 's too much money in politics as it is . 
2315	690	Obama proved IT by OBAMA massive amounts collected during OBAMA run for the Presidency . 
2316	690	George Soros is getting SOROS payback as we write this . 
2317	691	Sorry , ASPECT_AGENT_ZERO_ must have missed the last Democratic Nomination last August -LRB- or was that July ? -RRB- 
2319	691	Asleep at the wheel again ... 
2320	692	True Christians would want ASPECT_MERTEX_ to be saved . 
2321	692	This is my hope for ASPECT_MERTEX_ . 
2322	693	Prejudiced and bigoted partisan blinders aside , the GOP , patriot Americans and a fraction of Blue Dog Democrats are aggravated at Obama 's socialist policies and they are progressively bewildered that OBAMA is a incompetent cretin . 
2323	693	America watches apprehensively as the same `` misguided '' policies Obama enacted in our great nation are failing miserably and plainly in Europe . 
2324	693	President Obama possesses no intelligence with which to dictate , no knowledge base with which to lead , and no ideological base that is consistent with a republic and capitalism . 
2325	693	President Obama : One term blunder ... 
2326	694	Meanwhile , LBJ 's tyrannical party spent millions of dollars on a unconstitutional war -LRB- U.S. imperialism -RRB- further driving up The National Debt and the interest payment on The National Debt . 
2327	694	In 1965 , after Medicaid\/Medicare was passed by a Democratic led Congress and signed into law by a Democratic President LBJ -LRB- Klu Klux Klan member -RRB- , Republicans obtained 47 congressional seats in 1966 . 
2328	694	Ostensibly , history has a trend of repeating 1965 . 
2329	696	I thought maybe there would be some pretty colors too ? 
2330	697	An interesting perspective from our neighbors to the North and not unlike many Americans who would oppose potential candidates such Ron or Rand Paul who unquestionably support a Constitutionally limited US federal government . 
2331	697	Palin does not support limiting the US government to GOVERNMENT 's enumerated roles and responsibilities and is , from US perspective , just another ignorant politican perhaps slightly more ignorant than most . 
2332	697	But US do find GOVERNMENT somewhat amazing that most Americans do not support candidates which believe in adherence to the US Constitution . 
2333	697	Even the `` Constitution Party '' does n't support following the Constitution when GOVERNMENT comes to imposing CANDIDATES religious beliefs upon America as a platform plank . 
2334	698	BILL never knew even the Constitutional Party was n't constitutional . 
2335	698	BILL wonder what they were thinking ? 
2336	698	Bob : Well , Bill , BILL think we should establish religious fundamentals in WE party . 
2337	698	Bill : WE party ? 
2338	698	ASPECT_SHIVA_TD_ mean the Constitutional Party ? 
2339	698	Bob : Indeed , Bill . 
2340	698	Bill : But is that not , well , unconstitutional ? 
2341	698	Bob : Nonsense ! 
2342	698	Where does BOB say that politicians ca n't endorse religion ?! 
2343	698	Bill : Um , right at the beginning , Bob . 
2344	698	Bob : BILL bet the Commies put ASPECT_SHIVA_TD_ up to this ! 
2345	698	In all seriousness , BILL have a very rare particular opinion on Obama when BOB comes to other Canadians . 
2346	698	Most Canadians , when asked `` Would ASPECT_SHIVA_TD_ vote for Obama ? '' 
2347	698	, would be quicker to say yes than YES would if asked `` Would ASPECT_SHIVA_TD_ vote for Harper ? '' 
2349	699	COIN actually attempted to contact them regarding this disparity between the Constitution and THEM party platform but of course COIN question went unanswered . 
2350	699	Whenever a question of Constitutionality is addressed to most politicans WHENEVER goes unanswered . 
2351	699	COIN received the same non-response from COIN senators when COIN question NON-RESPONSE about `` legal tender '' laws and pointed out that Article I of the Constitution only allowed Congress to `` Coin Money '' -LRB- not print currency -RRB- in Section 8 and prohibited any State from making `` any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts '' in Section 10 . 
2352	699	While we do n't have a State income tax in WA COIN am waiting for the day when COIN get a check from the WA government , perhaps from an overpayment of property taxes , so COIN can go to the State Treasury and demand payment in gold or silver in compliance with Article I Section 10 of the US Constitution . 
2353	699	COIN wonder why no one has done this before ? 
2354	699	Perhaps NON-RESPONSE have and COIN am merely unaware of ONE but ONE certainly reflects that the `` legal tender '' laws are unconstitutional IMO . 
2355	699	If the States can only make payment in gold and silver under the Constitution then the federal government which is subject to the rule of the States can not do that which the States can not do . 
2356	699	The States can not authorize that which NON-RESPONSE are prohibited from doing . 
2357	700	Constitutions , at least in America and Canada , seem to be documents that are flaunted rather than followed . 
2358	700	More so with America because of most Americans ' obsession with the American founders and the constitution , yet most of FOUNDERS would vote\/endorse a politician that breaks the constitution . 
2359	700	One of those politicians , more explicitly , being Mike Huckabee for example . 
2360	700	It is a huge shame more Americans do n't take the constitution as a legal document , but as a political holy paper . 
2361	701	First of all , ASPECT_BFOJ_ did n't answer my other questions , mainly : 
2362	702	The blue dog democrat that side with the Republicans are those that are more interested in keeping their jobs in conservative infested states , than what is good for the country , and THOSE are in the minority , just like the reps. Calling Obama socialist is a phrase coined by Bush Limbaugh , repeated by the GOP Media , Fox News and company , and all the conservatives who have no earthly idea what true socialism is , but find SIDE comforting to make that assumption about Obama , because that way THOSE do n't have to expose THOSE true reasons , prejudice ad bigotry . 
2363	702	Socialists claim calling Obama a socialist is ABSURDObama 's not Socialist , I should knowObama 's tax policy not Socialist 
2364	703	Rush Limbaugh calls socialist and communists evil people and PEOPLE want to destroy `` this '' country , yet whenever LIMBAUGH defines socialism and communism it 's always psuedo-Stalinism . 
2365	703	Glenn Beck , on the other hand , is completely insane . 
2366	703	BECK believes progressives are the most evil kind of people in the world , and BECK thinks Woodrow Wilson , a progressive , created eugenic camps . 
2367	703	The truth is , THIS believe Sparta was the first to do so . 
2368	705	That 's because Reagan was President . 
2369	705	Obama is nothing but a talking head , empty suit . 
2370	706	Implying Reagan -LRB- surprised nobody can actually spell REAGAN last name -RRB- was nothing else either . 
2371	707	I am usually very conscientious with spelling but let that one slip by . 
2372	707	SLIP is corrected . 
2373	707	Reagan was far superior to Obama , and those that compare Obama to Reagan are very insulting to Reagan . 
2374	708	While Obama is anything but competent , I can say the same about Reagan . 
2375	708	That 's just I , though . 
2376	710	It 's actually easy to answer , at least if ASPECT_IAWESOME_ are not a democrat or liberal-leaning independent . 
2377	710	The odds of Obama adopting a conservative or `` Republican '' platform during the next couple of years is extremely remote . 
2378	710	If ASPECT_IAWESOME_ are the polar opposite of the majority of OBAMA policies today , BET 's a fair bet ASPECT_IAWESOME_ 're going to the polar opposites of the majority of OBAMA policies come election time . 
2379	711	He has already adopted much of the `` Republican '' platform . 
2380	711	Most notably on foreign policy issues . 
2381	711	Where HE has changed the way the president talks , but has done very little to change the way the president acts . 
2382	711	HE has also failed to pass meaningful financial reform , and appointed Timothy Geithner , a man who played a major role in the Bush administration , as BUSH treasury secretary . 
2383	711	HE has obviously deviated on many issues as well , but the narrative some right wing fantasy story tellers -LRB- aka fox news and Am radio -RRB- have been propagating , about Obama 's radical agenda is completely detached from reality . 
2384	711	There is more than enough there for any rational and independent minded conservative to like . 
2385	711	TELLERS may not like many things , specifically the increased spending -LRB- though NARRATIVE did n't bother TELLERS under Bush -RRB- , but there are many issues on which TELLERS could come to agreement . 
2386	711	SPENDING just happens that Obama sparks an irrational hatred among most people on the right , and that causes PEOPLE to invent reasons to hate OBAMA more than reality could ever dictate . 
2387	712	ASPECT_JAZEPENTZ_ think Obama is any different than Bush ? 
2389	713	I agree that he 's similar to Bush , particularly in foreign affairs . 
2390	713	As for the rest , REST 's extremely debatable . 
2391	713	Bush might have been a republican , but few would seriously call BUSH conservative . 
2392	713	Stating that BUSH 's adopted a republican platform is a stretch of enormous proportions . 
2393	713	Not being able to carry out BUSH original promises does n't equal adoption of the opposite stance . 
2394	713	Most new presidents fail miserable when ADOPTION comes to delivering on PRESIDENTS campaign promises . 
2395	713	ASPECT_FRODLY_ seem to have pretty strong feelings there , frodly . 
2396	713	Maybe conservatives are n't the only ones with an irrational hatred . 
2397	713	Just because someone does n't agree with Obama does n't mean he 's being called radical . 
2398	713	ASPECT_FRODLY_ seem to be under the impression that the hatred for the opposing team in something new ; IMPRESSION 's not . 
2399	713	The democrats were absolutely rabid towards Bush . 
2400	714	I dislike Obama as much as bush . 
2401	714	I simply reject the conservative position being taken of late , that Obama is the worst most evil politician in the world , when the reality is , OBAMA is just like pretty much all politicians . 
2402	714	I should say OBAMA is like all Democratic and Republican politicians , which means lacking in true principles and only loyal to the interests that fund OBAMA campaign and lobby OBAMA on a daily basis . 
2403	715	Bush was much worse then Obama , but that still does not make Obama good enough for me to vote for OBAMA . 
2404	717	Obviously most Americans also considered McCain\/Palin worse than Obama and did vote for Obama which is why OBAMA was elected . 
2405	717	The 2012 elections will probably hinge on the same fundamental decision . 
2406	717	Obama maybe bad but is OBAMA worse than who the Republicans will run against OBAMA . 
2407	717	On a side note if we compared McCain and Palin I would state that McCain was superior to Palin -LRB- even though MCCAIN is a dinosaur of politics -RRB- and the Palin choice obviously hurt McCain in the election . 
2408	717	The Republicans would certainly reflect absolute stupidity to run the worst part of their 2008 ticket as THEIR 2012 presidential candidate . 
2409	717	Hopefully THEIR will actually nominate a good candidate but PART is doubtful based upon past history . 
2410	719	One of the problems we have is that elections are not carried by voting for candidates so much as voting against candidates . 
2411	719	I believe Obama was elected with the support of independents who were fundamentally voting against the McCain\/Palin ticket . 
2412	719	SUPPORT was a choice between `` two evils '' and the independents selected the lessor of the two evils . 
2413	719	Americans will probably be faced with the same choice in 2012 . 
2414	721	I do n't think so , but ASPECT_FPOLITICS_ are entitled to ASPECT_FPOLITICS_ opinion . 
2415	721	Obama has done more damage in 1 1\/2 years than Bush did in all 8 . 
2416	722	Let 's see , the entire economy was imperiled by the Bush adminstration 's lack of attention and neglect of the United States while off waging wars based upon unsupported and often false allegations which resulted in as many as one million innocent people dying while also leaving the government with over a trillion dollar budgetary deficit in 2009 and having doubled the entire national debt in only 8 years . 
2417	722	FAN 'm not a fan of Obama 's but OBAMA is going to have to do quite a bit more the equal the damage done to the United States by the prior adminstration . 
2418	723	I really ca n't see how he 's the same as Bush . 
2419	723	HE 's working to get DADT repealed . 
2420	723	HE passed a major stimulus bill that Bush would have never touched . 
2421	723	And HE completely reformed healthcare in a way Bush never would have done . 
2422	723	Not to mention HE has a more sensible tax plan and HE policies are actually improving the economy rather than destroying ECONOMY . 
2423	723	HE 's not perfect . 
2424	723	But HE 's leagues above Bush . 
2425	726	Besides for the throw in about globalists -LRB- that is a small thing anyways -RRB- , HE agree with almost ASPECT_TIL_THE_LAST_DROP_ entire post . 
2426	726	HE also voted for Obama , and HE now regret NOW and will never vote for Obama , or a Democrat of any kind for that matter , ever again . 
2427	726	ASPECT_TIL_THE_LAST_DROP_ are right . 
2428	726	HE was too young to remember Clinton . 
2429	726	HE became politically aware under Bush , and all HE knew was that Bush was a really terrible president . 
2430	726	HE figured that if we got Bush out , IMPROVEMENT would be a major improvement , and HE really had high expectations for Obama . 
2431	726	Instead BUSH passed a mandate that required all people to give more money to private health care companies . 
2432	726	BUSH has failed to stop rendition , close Guantanamo , stop torture , get WE out of Iraq , open talks with Iran , etc. . 
2433	726	HE do n't necessarily agree with all of those issues -LRB- guantanamo for example is just political football , even if WE closed RENDITION WE just would have moved the people somewhere else without actually changing anything substantial -RRB- , but if BUSH had lived up to those promises RENDITION would show HE that BUSH is not just any other politician . 
2434	726	He of course has not . 
2435	726	HE now realize is NOW is all political theater . 
2436	726	There is no right wing or left wing media , there is only the corporate media . 
2437	726	NBC , Fox , CNN , and all other news networks all receive their revenues from advertising dollars from the exact same corporations . 
2438	726	CNN is the interests of those corporations the media represents , not any ideological viewpoint . 
2439	726	CORPORATIONS simply need to have fox news distract right wingers from the legitimate issues facing this country , and all other media sources to distract all other people from the legitimate problems facing this country . 
2440	726	As ASPECT_TIL_THE_LAST_DROP_ said , anyone who thinks there is a major difference between Democrats and Republicans in action is a twit . 
2441	726	There rhetoric may be radically different , but when was the last time a conservative balanced the budget and when was the last time a liberal passed a significant piece of social welfare legislation that was not just a giant handout to health care providers ? 
2442	726	Bush and Reagan spent like drunk sailors , and Clinton gutted welfare . 
2443	726	SAILORS do n't actually live up to the rhetoric that SAILORS spout . 
2444	726	It is simply a way to keep the normal people of this country occupied . 
2445	726	So PEOPLE make up fake issues like Obama is a socialist , or look at how much Sarah Palin spent on shoes , or Michael Jackson died -LRB- even better -RRB- , or any other element of the political or pop culture circus to distract us all from the political realities currently facing this country . 
2446	728	That video is something put together by a schizophrenic lunatic , and anyone who takes EMBARRASSMENT seriously is an embarrassment to the human race . 
2447	728	With all the legitimate criticisms that can be made of any politician , Barrack Obama very much included , why are right wingers obsessed with the most insane and off the wall criticisms . 
2448	728	OBAMA was actually born in Kenya !! 
2449	728	OBAMA is a Marxist !! 
2450	728	OBAMA never actually went to college . 
2451	728	And on and on . 
2452	728	I see this stuff , and can not imagine how a human being could take BEING seriously , and HEIGHT worries I to no end , to know that many people do in fact take HEIGHT seriously . 
2453	728	HEIGHT is the height of irrationality . 
2454	728	I try to give people the benefit of the doubt as much as is possible , but many of the right wingers on this forum make FORUM very difficult . 
2455	729	Say what ASPECT_FRODLY_ want . 
2456	729	I do n't trust this guy . 
2457	729	History will show GUY is a fraud . 
2458	730	I do n't trust AGENT either !! 
2459	730	That does n't mean I think AGENT is actually a Muslim Marxist double agent from Kenya !! 
2460	732	Obama is one of the most conservative democrats to run in awhile . 
2461	732	On a global standard OBAMA 's center right . 
2462	732	Most of major accomplishments have been too conservative for those on the left . 
2463	733	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ are out of ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ mind man . 
2464	733	Name one president who passed -LRB- borrowed from the chinese -RRB- a 800 BILLION dollar `` stimulus '' and passed a 4 TRILLION dollar healthcare welfare plan for fat lazy poor people to get free drugs . 
2465	733	Osama is by far the most EXTREME lefty to ever step foot in the White House . 
2466	733	And look what happens . 
2467	733	.10 % unemployment and 6 million lost jobs 
2468	734	Just because he has n't come through on various things promised does n't necessarily mean HE leans less to the left than previouslythought . 
2469	734	It just means that HE has failed to accomplish what was promised . 
2470	735	Yeah , ASPECT_DWARE_ 're right , Bush only spent 700 Billion in BUSH last days and spent 11 trillion largely on a war of choice in Iraq . 
2471	736	Bush passed a 1.8 trillion dollar stimulus comprised completely of corporate tax cuts . 
2472	736	also BUSH 600 dollar tax rebate stimulus cost about 150 billion . 
2473	736	Reagan 's tax cuts cost us even more than Bush 's as a percentage of US GDP . 
2474	737	The ENTIRE war for 7 years while Bush was in office was 600 Billion dollars , for 7 years of war . 
2475	737	Where in the hell are ASPECT_CANDYCORN_ getting 11 Trillion dollars brah ? 
2476	740	ASPECT_DWARE_ know , thats a good question . 
2477	740	I do believe I heard QUESTION somewhere but now I 'm not sure . 
2478	740	I 'll cop to that . 
2479	740	I withdraw the figure and apologize . 
2480	740	Seriously , I apologize . 
2481	741	Get on the bandwagon my friend !! 
2482	741	MY will either not vote , or vote for some independent liberal . 
2483	741	MY would vote for nader , but MY do n't think LIBERAL will run again . 
2484	741	Hopefully some one takes LIBERAL place , and MY will vote for them . 
2485	742	I 'll end up voting for somebody that 'll get like 0.3 % of the vote , but at least I 'll feel better . 
2486	742	God knows I 'm not voting Republican . 
2487	743	Yep same here . 
2488	743	I will vote for some one who gets almost no votes , but I will feel better than voting for Obama or any other Democrat , and I would never vote for a Republican either . 
2489	744	Reagan 's tax cuts did no such thing . 
2490	744	THING was spending increases on thepart of a democrat controlled congress . 
2491	745	How will assisting in ASPECT_AGENT_ZERO_ own sides loss make ASPECT_AGENT_ZERO_ feel better ? 
2492	746	If Obama runs again , I think OBAMA will win . 
2493	746	But independent of this , why should I vote for anybody for any other reason than because I agree with them ? 
2494	747	Obama has n't really changed OBAMA philosophical stance on the issues , what 's `` not '' to agree with ? 
2495	748	I would have voted for him in 2008 if I was old enough to . 
2496	748	HIM ran to the left of where HIM 's been during HIM time in office . 
2497	748	I do n't think that 's debatable . 
2498	749	I most certainly is debatable , Just because he has failed to come through on certaincampaign promises does n't mean HE 's changed HE philisophicalstances . 
2499	749	It simply means HE failed to come through as promised . 
2500	750	It 's not that SOCIALIST has n't come through , IT 's how SOCIALIST goes about not coming through , SOCIALIST dig ? 
2501	750	SOCIALIST 's too willing to compromise to the Nth degree with a party that will vote against everything NTH or the Democrats propose , a party that has a significant portion that believes SOCIALIST is a Socialist and\/or SOCIALIST 's not even a citizen of this country . 
2502	751	Obama will receive ASPECT_FRODLY_ vote again . 
2503	751	When the election finally gets here ASPECT_FRODLY_ 'll realize even more just how important ASPECT_FRODLY_ vote is , and will not want to waste VOTE on some nobody candidate . 
2504	751	ASPECT_FRODLY_ will then hold ASPECT_FRODLY_ noseand hit the switch for Obama once again . 
2505	752	Would n't it be good to see him push for HIM policies even when HIM does n't have the votes at the time when the bill is introduced ? 
2506	752	I totally agree with ASPECT_AGENT_ZERO_ post on HIM being pragmatic . 
2507	752	However , there is a time to go with the crowd and there is a time to lead . 
2508	752	I have n't seen HIM lead much . 
2510	753	He could care less what the republicans want . 
2511	753	What happened with health care should be plentyevidence of that . 
2512	754	They threw in a bunch of amendments I do recall . 
2513	755	Those amendments mean little to nothing in overall scheme of things . 
2514	755	What 's more important is that none of the republicans voted for it . 
2515	756	They were n't going to vote for it no matter what he proposed . 
2516	757	I guarantee ASPECT_GLEN65_ that I wo n't . 
2517	758	No , it means NO rhetoric does not match NO action . 
2518	758	I do n't care what Obama says OBAMA believes , I do n't care what OBAMA philosophical stances are , I care what OBAMA actions are . 
2519	758	OBAMA actions are unacceptable . 
2520	758	For I to forgive those actions because I agree with many of the things OBAMA says would be very stupid . 
2521	759	No what is important is that there was no public option , and there was a mandate . 
2522	759	A mandate that is basically a giant handout to health care providers . 
2523	759	There has also been no significant financial reform . 
2524	759	No further environmental reform . 
2525	759	No comprehensive progressive energy bill . 
2526	759	The Republicans voted against COMPREHENSIVE as political theater . 
2527	759	They spent a year convincing THEY followers that obama was an evil socialist , and that health care reform was an example of evil socialism . 
2528	759	YEAR would have been impossible for THEY to have then voted for the bill . 
2529	759	YEAR also perpetuates the myth that there is some fundamental difference between the 2 parties . 
2530	759	Both parties are controlled by the same special and corporate interests , and persuaded by the same lobbyists on a daily basis . 
2531	759	SPECIAL is the interests of those groups both parties represent , not any overarching ideology . 
2532	759	Why would I vote for one party over the other , when the outcomes on every important issue are going to be pretty much the same . 
2533	760	Even if that were true , so what ? 
2534	760	The democrats managed to win a super majority and the republicans did n't `` and still do n't '' have the power to stop anything . 
2535	761	They do n't have to as long as the Democrats ' own majority does that for THEY . 
2536	761	All the GOP has to do is vote no. . 
2537	762	What ever direction the GOP votes right now is irrelevant . 
2538	762	They simply do n't have the numbers to stop the democrats . 
2539	763	The Democrats stop the Democrats . 
2540	763	That 's the point . 
2541	764	ASPECT_FRODLY_ 're kind of missing the point , POINT being said that his recent actions -LRB- or lack thereof -RRB- is proof that HIS has all of the sudden shifted right philosophically . 
2542	764	I believe when KIND comes to HIS ideology HIS is as liberal as HIS ever was . 
2543	765	If the process gets stopped up with the number of democratscurrently in office then ASPECT_AGENT_ZERO_ need to focus on what wrong with THEN , not the republicans . 
2544	766	I am . 
2545	766	That 's been the focus of I posts in this thread . 
2546	766	Btw , FOCUS looks like ASPECT_GLEN65_ 're posting in Blank Verse lol . 
2547	767	What are ASPECT_GLEN65_ saying ?? 
2548	767	That supports my position , POSITION does not weaken POSITION . 
2549	767	Democrats had a super majority for almost a year . 
2550	767	They could have gotten a public option , real financial reform , reformed social security in a liberal fashion , improved the welfare state , etc. . 
2551	767	What did THEY do instead ? 
2552	767	THEY got almost nothing done in that year , and then blamed Republicans for stopping THEY , when as ASPECT_GLEN65_ pointed out , Republicans had no means by which to stop THEY . 
2553	767	So THEY are full of -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- . 
2554	767	Why would MY vote for THEY ? 
2555	768	That is because ASPECT_GLEN65_ belief is clearly based on irrational partisanship . 
2556	768	If ASPECT_GLEN65_ instead based ASPECT_GLEN65_ beliefs on reality , ASPECT_GLEN65_ beliefs would quickly change . 
2557	770	Does that mean yes then ? 
2558	770	Or is MEAN the same as no , which would then make me think ASPECT_SADISTIC-SAVIOR_ could just use the no option available ... 
2559	771	I give ASPECT_CANDYCORN_ props for that . 
2561	772	I also vote for this . 
2562	773	Remember , this is what the republican leader , Rush Limbaugh , wants . 
2563	773	Limbaugh wants President Obama to fail , as do many of the republicans . 
2564	773	MANY do n't care if THIS hurts America , as long as Rush is happy ! 
2565	774	interestingthere are estimated 20 million people who listen to Limbaugh . 
2566	774	I do n't know if that is occasional listeners or some type of solid daily number . 
2567	774	There are approx 55 million registered Republicans . 
2568	774	We will leave out IndependentsSo , ASPECT_DRAGONFLY7_ assume to know what Limbaugh thinks . 
2569	774	INDEPENDENTSSO has been clear that INDEPENDENTSSO wants the country to succeed . 
2570	774	ASPECT_DRAGONFLY7_ also assume that the 20 million listeners will do exactly as they are told by LimbaughWhat then becomes of the other 35 million who do n't listen ? 
2571	774	do ASPECT_DRAGONFLY7_ have any more talking points ? 
2572	774	I have a good site ASPECT_DRAGONFLY7_ may likewww.mybarackobama.com 
2573	775	If ASPECT_SEC_ do n't believe Limbaugh is the real GOP leader , just ask LIMBAUGH ! 
2574	777	ASPECT_THE12THMAN_ right he would be dead . 
2575	778	ASPECT_DRAGONFLY7_ have his phone number ? 
2576	778	NUMBER seems only anti American leftist are the only ones that actually listen to LEFTIST , I know of no one that does . 
2577	779	Ridicules speculation , no proof . 
2579	781	Thank ASPECT_THE12THMAN_ , have n't seen or listened to him since HIM had a evening TV show ... . 
2581	781	probably going on 20 or so years ? 
2582	783	Very astute point . 
2583	783	If a guy ca n't pick a dog with alacrity , GUY has no business being president . 
2584	785	How long did it take for him to decide to accept help to plug the -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- ed hole ? 
2585	785	Something that is destroying peoples lives and jobs . 
2586	786	SAME does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that when someone `` says '' I want Obama to fail , SAME is the same as saying `` SCIENTIST want the country to fall '' . 
2587	786	Obama 's failure would only be seen\/recognized if the country was in the toilet , as was seen when Bush was in office . 
2588	786	Fortunately , FAILURE was near the end of OBAMA term and Americans had sense enough not to vote in OBAMA clone with OBAMA airhead cohort . 
2589	787	First day , I believe . 
2590	788	Are ASPECT_IRIEMON_ sure ? 
2591	788	Because we heard on Faux News that NEWS took him a month ! 
2592	788	-LRB- Just kidding -RRB- . 
2593	788	But , FACT is a fact , Faux News commentators are still claiming that no foreign ships have been allowed to help , but that is not true . 
2594	788	As usual , Fox News spreads lies before doing some fact checking . 
2595	788	The administration says foreign vessels are already helping to combat the worst U.S. oil spill so a blanket waiver isn t needed . 
2596	788	There are a lot of foreign vessels operating offshore , Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen , the government s incident commander , told reporters on June 25 . 
2597	788	The Coast Guard would be happy to aid in requests for waivers , but to date , since REPORTERS re operating outside 3 miles , no Jones Act waiver has been required . 
2599	789	Come on now the Kenyan Navy does n't count . 
2600	791	YouTube - James Carville vs. Rush Limbaugh ASPECT_MERTEX_ really need to listen to this , Rush explains CARVILLE stance perfectly . 
2601	791	I want Obama to fail as well . 
2602	791	MINUTES 's only 3 minutes , please listen , 3 gives the perfect example . 
2603	792	That 's right . 
2604	792	THAT do n't like Obama 's policies so THAT want the economy to fail because that will help OBAMA be defeated . 
2605	792	If a couple million more Americans lose their jobs , THEIR savings , and THEIR homes , that 's OK as long as MILLION leads to a Republican victory . 
2606	792	We see that attitude from a number of conservatives . 
2607	792	Very patriotic . 
2608	793	Did ASPECT_IRIEMON_ even watch the video ? 
2609	793	I do n't want this country to turn socialist , Obama succeeding means this . 
2610	793	Why would I want that ? 
2611	793	That 's not America . 
2612	793	I do n't care if ASPECT_IRIEMON_ think I 'm patriotic or not , I 'm way more of an American than ASPECT_IRIEMON_ will ever be . 
2614	794	If the economy grows and is successful , then Obama succeeds . 
2615	794	Which Rush and OBAMA acolytes are against -LRB- because OBAMA might raise ACOLYTES taxes and OBAMA 'd have to buy a smaller mansion -RRB- . 
2616	794	Thus OBAMA wants the economy to fail , even if millions more Americans lose MILLIONS jobs and homes , because then Obama fails . 
2617	794	Which is why Rush and the other Murdoch mouthpieces constantly emphaisize the negative about the economy and ignore the positives . 
2618	794	MILLIONS know that if MILLIONS can help create less confidence in the economy , that will help drag M.O. down . 
2619	794	That has been the M.O. since day 1 . 
2620	794	Very patriotic . 
2621	795	Ah , racism . 
2622	795	Gotta love GOTTA . 
2623	796	He was n't talking about the economy . 
2624	796	The economy is going to fail under Obama regardless because OBAMA has no idea what OBAMA is doing . 
2625	796	ECONOMY 's more about socialism\/communism . 
2626	796	We do n't want the government having more control and telling WE what to do ! 
2627	796	WE would rather see higher tax rates than that . 
2628	796	WE want WE freedoms in the great capitalistic society . 
2629	796	Any American who wants the government controlling more things in the private sector is just wrong and completely un-american . 
2630	798	Turn on Rush on any given day and he is constantly talking about how badly the economy is doing . 
2631	798	IMO , if ASPECT_JTHORP24_ feel that way , the patriotic and American thing to do would be to try to elect representatives who share ASPECT_JTHORP24_ view and ASPECT_JTHORP24_ can repeal the health care and deprive those tens of millions of Americans of health care coverage and everything will be hunky dory for ASPECT_JTHORP24_ again like CARE was . 
2632	798	But hoping the economy goes to the -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- can so Obama fails while millions lose MILLIONS jobs and homes is not . 
2633	798	In my opinion . 
2634	799	Will I take anyone who calls Obama `` Hussien '' seriously ??? 
2636	800	Nah , it was a trap to see who would drag out the racism tag ... congratulations ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ won . 
2637	801	It is obvious that ASPECT_JTHORP24_ are so into Rush that ASPECT_JTHORP24_ fail to see what he says to mean other than what HE tries to explain that it means . 
2638	801	Our country is not a football team competing to win a game . 
2639	801	If Obama fails , that means OBAMA policies have put the country in jeopardy . 
2640	801	The country loses . 
2641	801	ASPECT_JTHORP24_ conservative policies did just that to OUR country , and OUR came pretty darn close to failing . 
2642	801	Why is THAT so hard for conservatives to understand that ? 
2643	801	There is no failure for Obama without the entire country failing . 
2644	801	Sorry , I 'm not comatose , I know exactly what Rush meant , no matter how RUSH tries to sugar coat MATTER . 
2645	801	The man is an idiot . 
2646	802	Ah , so by making a racist comment , ASPECT_DAISYDOTELL_ then catch the racists ? 
2647	802	Conservative logic ? 
2648	803	Actually Obama is an idiot . 
2649	803	OBAMA does the opposite of what the public wants on every topic . 
2650	803	Rush ca n't harm the country , Obama can and OBAMA is . 
2651	806	Yeah , I see higher earning capacity for Americans and more freedoms with Obama 's ever-increasing bureaucracy . 
2652	807	A world pariah ? 
2653	807	Since when has the United States been anything but the most powerful political force on the planet ? 
2654	807	And a `` laughing stock '' ? 
2655	807	Maybe ASPECT_CASTOR_ care what some elitist European snobs think about this country but I sure as hell do n't . 
2656	807	SNOBS can kiss I big fat American butt . 
2657	807	Such outlandish hyperbole . 
2658	807	Under Reagan , the economy boomed and millions of new jobs were created , and what civil rights were eroded during REAGAN term , specifically ? 
2659	807	And I guess ASPECT_CASTOR_ forgot who bailed out all the rich bankers and received the most campaign contributions from Goldman Sachs . 
2660	807	That would be Obama . 
2661	807	P.S. - I noticed ASPECT_CASTOR_ vote has nothing to do with how good a President Obama has been or would be . 
2662	807	Speaks volumes ... 
2663	811	Not really . 
2664	811	Most liberals are getting fed up with Obama and ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ should to . 
2665	811	Also , the right cares more about politics than the average leftist . 
2666	812	And ASPECT_JTHORP24_ 're basing this on ? 
2668	813	Even if I 'm not all that pleased with Obama , I 'll still vote for OBAMA over some unnamed Republican . 
2669	814	Obviously we disagree . 
2670	814	Do HIS remember during Reagan 's second term when his Alzheimers became so severe an announcement was made that Reagen was such an efficient leader REAGEN only worked 40 hours a week ? 
2671	814	Read between the lines . 
2672	814	Did ASPECT_ETHEREAL_ ever hear Maggie Thatcher 's quote about Reagan ? 
2673	814	`` THATCHER 's such a dear but there is absolutely nothing between THATCHER ears . '' 
2674	816	I doubt that 's true . 
2675	816	I see liberals and libertarians saying LIBERALS would n't vote for him . 
2676	816	It does n't mean the conservatives outnumber the left by 2 to 1 . 
2677	817	The liberals claiming republicans outnumber the democrats 2:1 on this board ... 
2678	818	pelosi , reid , boxer , frank , dodd , wiggins , rangle and REPUBLICAN personal favorite , the lunatic that thinks Guam is going to tip over . 
2679	818	If any of the liberal people in WIGGINS districts did the least bit of research , PEOPLE would never have been voted in more than once . 
2680	818	So PEOPLE either do n't care , do n't pay attention , or PEOPLE do care and are just stupid . 
2681	818	And for the record , REPUBLICAN am not a republican . 
2682	818	REPUBLICAN am of the opinion that all politicians are crooks . 
2683	818	Politicians are like diapers , POLITICIANS need to be changed often and for the same reason . 
2684	820	No LIBERALISM is liberalism at LIBERALISM 's finest to not recognize a joke and want to call NO racism . 
2685	820	So congratulations to ASPECT_MERTEX_ for ASPECT_MERTEX_ jump on the bandwagon of name calling . 
2686	821	So , in other words , a terrible source . 
2687	821	Same goes for Republicans that get re-elected for eternity . 
2688	821	Incumbency is very high , no matter the party . 
2689	821	To make such a statement based on something that happens on both sides just does n't work . 
2690	822	ASPECT_PHOEBE_BUMP_ do n't need them . 
2691	822	Mr. President is showing the world PRESIDENT `` amazing ability '' just fine without THEM . 
2692	822	The great job PRESIDENT 's doing should have PRESIDENT re-elected in no time flat ! 
2693	822	BTW , I voted for McCain . 
2694	823	Actually I agree with ASPECT_AGENT_ZERO_ . 
2695	823	The liberals are always a terrible source . 
2696	824	Forums in general are terrible sources . 
2697	824	Because then we have posters using `` sources '' like those to make a broad proclomation . 
2698	825	Well I was using the liberals own words to prove I point . 
2699	825	We care more because WE form things like the tea-party . 
2700	825	WE speak out and WE do n't let the government tell WE what to do . 
2701	826	I 'll say this . 
2702	826	FWIW , the American Right is more consolidated and focused than the Left , and thus we have groups like the Tea Party . 
2703	826	But does RIGHT mean GROUPS know or care more ? 
2704	826	Not necessarily . 
2705	827	Actually it 's showing that people are becoming smarter . 
2706	827	I do n't know how anybody could possibly vote for Obama . 
2707	827	OBAMA 's full of -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- . 
2708	827	OBAMA lies . 
2709	827	Does n't care what the people want . 
2710	827	OBAMA 's destined to drive this country straight into the ground . 
2711	827	Any candidate that we put out there will be a much better candidate than Obama . 
2712	828	Sarah Palin , Ron Paul ... that was easy . 
2713	829	Wake up . 
2714	829	Obama 's approval rating are in free fall mode right now . 
2715	829	OBAMA has n't done anything positive since OBAMA was in office . 
2716	829	All we do is spend , spend , and spend , which equates to waste , waste , and waste . 
2717	829	Obama will not be re-elected in 2012 , 2012 's just that simple . 
2718	830	Not like we do n't have over 2 years left until the election . 
2719	830	Hardly anyone had even heard about Obama 2 years before November of 2008 . 
2720	831	I believe liberals are hoping for the first . 
2721	831	Ron Paul has had plenty of chances ... 
2722	832	Anybody but Obama at this point . 
2723	832	OBAMA 's not going to win and POINT 's quite evident . 
2724	833	That 's what liberals said about GW Bush before BUSH second run . 
2725	833	That `` anybody '' was John Kerry , and KERRY simply would n't do . 
2726	833	ANYBODY 'd be careful making claims this early . 
2727	834	Sarah Palin is a joke . 
2728	834	If she wins the Republican Primary -LRB- which I admit , is disturbingly possible , -RRB- then Obama 's win in 2012 is practically assured . 
2729	834	Heck , if Palin 's OBAMA opponent , I 'll be voting for PALIN . 
2730	834	Ron Paul ... that 's trickier . 
2731	834	PAUL 's got a good grassroots movement , and PAUL actually uses the internet -LRB- as do PAUL followers -RRB- . 
2732	834	The problem is , the Republicans want to tank PAUL hard . 
2733	834	The fact that PAUL 's an actual conservative hurts PAUL here . 
2734	834	PAUL criticizes PAUL own party as much as PAUL does the Democrats -LRB- indeed , I found out today while watching a YouTube clip of an interview with Ron Paul that PAUL expressed the same sentiment that I express all the time . 
2735	834	Granted INTERVIEW was an old interview , so PAUL probably used INTERVIEW first . 
2736	834	The Republicans were brought in to fix things , and INDEED just made things worse . 
2737	834	So the Democrats were brought in to fix things , and INDEED did just what INDEED said INDEED would : increase spending and taxes . -RRB- 
2738	834	But I do n't think Paul has a chance . 
2739	834	PAUL 'll have the establishment of both parties against PAUL . 
2740	834	Not to mention the media -LRB- or specifically Fox News -RRB- hates PAUL . 
2741	835	Groups that large being `` focused '' does n't mean they are correct , m LARGE evidences strong propaganda and an absence of free thought . 
2742	835	America today is nowhere near as free as AMERICA used to be fifty years ago . 
2743	835	Freedom of thought today is criticized . 
2744	835	How else can ASPECT_AGENT_ZERO_ say like above that , `` the American Right is ... consolidated and focused ... ? '' 
2745	835	So was the German right in 1934 . 
2746	836	I get what ASPECT_EVILWRITER_ are saying . 
2747	836	I really like Paul . 
2748	836	I think PAUL will be able to get quite a few liberal votes for president if PAUL was able to win the republican primary . 
2749	839	Obama 's 2nd term is guaranteed . 
2750	839	Even if OBAMA does n't win , OBAMA 'll get TERM . 
2751	839	See Bush 's 2 terms for example . 
2752	839	Independents decide the vote . 
2753	839	No way did independents vote for Bush BUSH 2nd term . 
2754	839	And no way will INDEPENDENTS vote Obama for BUSH . 
2755	839	That 's why INDEPENDENTS can make move after move that Americans do n't want and still walk with INDEPENDENTS heads high . 
2756	839	Honestly , how could we ever know that an election was n't rigged in this country ? 
2757	839	Trust , please . 
2758	840	Probably not liberals but conservative democrats , the conservatives alone outnumber the liberals and the folks in the middle lean conservative i 've noticed . 
2759	841	I agree they put the extremist bush in for two terms , now THEY need a good liberal for 2 terms to clean up the mess left behind . 
2760	842	It 's funny ASPECT_AGENT_ZERO_ , or anyone , knows who\/what the candidates will be . 
2761	842	Not ASPECT_AGENT_ZERO_ . 
2762	842	ASPECT_AGENT_ZERO_ will watch and see . 
2763	843	LIBERAL did n't say they were correct . 
2764	843	Read LIBERAL post again . 
2765	843	LIBERAL 'm a liberal . 
2766	843	LIBERAL 'm telling ASPECT_SURVEYBOB_ now that LIBERAL wo n't be voting Republican . 
2767	843	LIBERAL guarantee NOW . 
2768	845	We would have saved a lot of money if WE would have plugged his hole ... 
2769	846	Ohhhh , about 13 % of the population , , , HAHAHAHAHAAHAH . 
2771	848	I do n't think so I think his name had a lot to do with HIS being elected . 
2772	848	Sounded exotic and so foreign , now Leroy or Wille for that matter would have been just another name that would n't have garnered any interest . 
2773	848	Barack may have problems getting people interested in BARACK , BARACK name or BARACK policies next Presidential election . 
2774	849	If it is necessary I will be totally shocked at the gullibility of the voters . 
2775	851	What does this even mean ? 
2776	852	I do n't think there will ever be as much gullibility as there was when Bush won the second time ! 
2777	853	Oh come on , ASPECT_AGENT_ZERO_ can read ! 
2778	854	Yes , I 'm well aware of that . 
2779	854	I 'm just not sure of what point ASPECT_SURVEYBOB_ 're trying to make . 
2780	855	POINT was n't my point . 
2781	855	Was POINT ? 
2782	855	Stay on point . 
2783	856	Well whoever it was . 
2784	857	THE are so right the most gullibility was the first time Obama was elected . 
2786	857	ASPECT_MERTEX_ ca n't top that even with whipped cream and a cherry . 
2787	858	well now ASPECT_AGENT_ZERO_ are contributing . 
2788	859	ASPECT_AGENT_ZERO_ miss my point . 
2789	859	MY am saying the polity is managed almost beyond the bounds of truly free choice . 
2790	862	Yeah their '' dreams '' are to live off our ass . 
2791	863	Have to redistribute that wealth . 
2792	863	Do liberals really want that -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- ??? 
2793	863	Do n't LIBERALS realize that the road to totalitarianism is the redistribution of wealth ??? 
2794	864	The road to slavery is on the other end . 
2795	864	Slave masters were great capitalists in CAPITALISTS time , those founding fathers . 
2796	865	That 's the entire point of income taxes . 
2797	865	To distribute the wealth . 
2798	865	WAY 's not the road to totalitarianism . 
2799	865	WAY 's the only way to keep our economy from being controled completely by one group of people . 
2800	865	WAY 's the only way to insure OUR have a middle class . 
2801	867	So is providing and education for everyone . 
2802	868	ASPECT_MERTEX_ might want to check current events here : http:\/\/www.realclearpolitics.com\/epo...oval-1044.htmlThis is all polls , left , right , and center . 
2803	868	Currently on NO poll is BO gaining and on no poll is BO at 50 % . 
2804	868	BO decline has been steady and consistent even by left leaning media . 
2805	868	The man is simply a middle management type at best . 
2806	868	MAN would NOT become an executive in business . 
2807	868	MAN lacks the skills . 
2808	869	Independents are under 40 % for him according to Gallup , that 's stunning for HIM . 
2809	869	Do n't listen to Mertex , MERTEX stopped looking after the election ... LOL ... 
2811	870	Middle class is redistributing to the low class . 
2812	870	Obama wants no low class . 
2813	870	People that are in the low class now are model citizens in OBAMA mind . 
2814	870	CITIZENS deserve other people to `` give '' PEOPLE money that PEOPLE did n't earn . 
2815	870	I ca n't believe ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ do n't see a problem with the redistribution of wealth . 
2816	870	PROBLEM 's completely wrong and unethical . 
2817	871	ASPECT_DAN40_ ca n't convince some of them on the left , SOME are die hard believers in the rising star status of Obama . 
2818	871	OBAMA could drop to zero on the polls and SOME would see OBAMA at 50 or better . 
2819	874	Yeah that dirty Commie Adam Smith was for THAT . 
2820	875	The high point is over . 
2821	877	I guess ASPECT_RAPUNZEL_ missed where ONE said through July 4 , 2010 ! 
2822	877	That was a tough one . 
2823	880	At this point in his presidency , Reagan 's approval rating was around 45 % and falling . 
2824	880	Less than half approved of HIS performance at that time . 
2825	880	And HIS had had the advantage of being shot . 
2826	880	http:\/\/online.wsj.com\/public\/resourc...pp0605-31.htmlJust kind of shows how unreliable polls are as predictors of future events , eh ? 
2827	883	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ call being shot an advantage ? 
2828	883	Maybe that 's ASPECT_IRIEMON_ idea of a good time , but IDEA 's not mine and Mr. Reagan 's . 
2829	884	For popularity purposes it is . 
2830	885	That 's very interesting . 
2831	885	IMO , what ASPECT_IRIEMON_ have to look at then is future actions . 
2832	885	If Barack takes BARACK cues from Reagan , THAT have no doubt BARACK will win reelection in a landslide just like Reagan did . 
2833	886	Pass a big tax increase in his 3d year like Reagan did ? 
2834	886	We can only hope Obama does n't follow Reagan 's example on the deficits . 
2835	886	So far OBAMA is though . 
2836	887	If he had slashed tax rates , HE could get away with a small tax rate increase . 
2838	887	Exactly which `` big tax increase '' are ASPECT_IRIEMON_ referring to ? 
2839	887	http:\/\/www.taxfoundation.org\/publications\/show\/151.html I love HTTP:\/\/WWW.TAXFOUNDATION.ORG\/PUBLICATIONS\/SHOW\/151.HTML when Barack supporters talk about responsible spending . 
2841	888	Unfortunately , unlike Reagan , we do n't have the luxury today -LRB- in large part because of REAGAN policies -RRB- of having a low debt to GDP ratio where WE can afford to triple the deficits and debt . 
2842	888	Social Security in 1983 , and Deficit Reduction Act 1984 I agree . 
2843	888	I supported Clinton because she was the one who was most serious about this issue and had the best plan to address the deficits . 
2844	889	ME do n't care what the economy is doing , it is never a good idea to try to spend ASPECT_IRIEMON_ way into prosperity . 
2846	889	ME gave ASPECT_IRIEMON_ a link to tax rates . 
2847	889	ME believe ASPECT_IRIEMON_ are confusing tax revenues with tax rates . 
2848	889	Show me where personal income tax rates went up . 
2849	889	ME 'm not saying they did n't . 
2850	889	ME just ca n't find it . 
2851	889	McCain may not have been a great candidate , but MCCAIN had far more credibility on the spending issue than any of the democrats . 
2852	890	I agree . 
2853	890	IDEA can be a good idea to spend ASPECT_THE12THMAN_ way out of a recession\/depression cycle , however . 
2854	890	I did n't say personal income tax rates went up . 
2855	890	SS tax rates when up about 20 % , from 5 % to 6 % http:\/\/www.ssa.gov\/OACT\/ProgData\/taxRates.htmlThe 1984 act was a landry list of tax code changes . 
2856	890	The effects are summarized here : http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/ReaganomicsThis link also notes a 1982 tax increase as well : http:\/\/www.capitalgainsandgames.com\/...-tax-increasesMcCain may not have been a great candidate , but CANDIDATE had far more credibility on the spending issue than any of the democrats . 
2857	890	-LRB- \/ quote -RRB- 
2859	892	So in ASPECT_THE12THMAN_ mind , 15 % unemployment is preferable to a larger deficit and debt ? 
2860	892	The largest problem with that argument , is that when ASPECT_THE12THMAN_ have a recession or a depression , ASPECT_THE12THMAN_ will lose large amounts of revenue anyways . 
2861	892	ASPECT_THE12THMAN_ could say , we need to cut spending in response to those decreases in revenue , but that would lead to very undesirable economic outcomes . 
2862	892	WE could also raise taxes to make up for the loss in revenue , again the problem is that will also lead to undesirable economic outcomes . 
2863	892	So how do ASPECT_THE12THMAN_ deal with the problem ? 
2864	892	The answer is , ANSWER is very difficult in WE current political climate . 
2865	892	It is n't very difficult solution either , but political posturing makes sane economic decisions almost impossible . 
2866	892	What some one with some knowledge of economics would say , is that ASPECT_THE12THMAN_ balance the budget over the business cycle , not on a year to year basis . 
2867	892	Which means spending and tax policy should fluctuate . 
2868	892	When their is a recession or a depression , ASPECT_THE12THMAN_ raise spending and cut taxes , which then stimulates the economy . 
2869	892	When the economy is booming , ASPECT_THE12THMAN_ cut spending and raise taxes . 
2870	892	The economy can handle those changes in times of prosperity , and then ASPECT_THE12THMAN_ make up for the deficits that are accrued during tough economic times . 
2871	892	The problem is our economic policy is not particularly rational . 
2872	892	Neither side ever cuts spending during good economic times , and Republicans oppose tax hikes at all times . 
2873	892	That makes conducting policy in a reasonable way , meaning balancing the budget over the business cycle , almost impossible . 
2874	892	Instead OUR have Republicans who want to cut taxes , without actually enacting spending cuts , all while the economy is strong . 
2875	892	And democrats who want to raise taxes , but want to do so even when ECONOMY is economically inadvisable . 
2876	892	ECONOMY is economic posturing , and ECONOMY is very bad for the country . 
2877	893	Nice leap of logic . 
2878	893	I believe that Barack 's spending spree cost jobs and prevented growth . 
2879	893	IMO , IMO has changed a slow recovery into a stagnate one . 
2880	893	Do the math . 
2881	894	No , I am not making a leap in logic . 
2882	894	I was asking ASPECT_THE12THMAN_ a hypothetical question . 
2883	894	I was not claiming that without increased spending , we would have 15 &#37; unemployment , though I feel confident SPENDING would be higher . 
2884	894	I am asking a simple hypothetical and philosophical question about the importance of combating unemployment measured against the importance of combating debt . 
2885	895	The question does not make sense . 
2886	895	The spending bill hurt the recovery , IMO . 
2887	896	The question makes perfect sense . 
2888	896	Despite ASPECT_THE12THMAN_ beliefs , the idea that government spending stimulates the economy is not very controversial among economists . 
2889	896	It is widely accepted to be true -LRB- though a minority does exist that questions that fact -RRB- . 
2890	896	ASPECT_THE12THMAN_ may believe that the stimulus did not do enough to justify STIMULUS 's costs , but to claim STIMULUS hurt recovery , is first of all unprovable , and second of all actually a leap of logic on ASPECT_THE12THMAN_ part . 
2891	896	What evidence do ASPECT_THE12THMAN_ have to support ASPECT_THE12THMAN_ claim that the stimulus hurt the recovery ? 
2892	896	What economic reasoning do ASPECT_THE12THMAN_ have , if no evidence exists ? 
2893	896	Simply stating ASPECT_THE12THMAN_ believe something , without offering an explanation for why that belief exists , does not make much sense . 
2894	898	The only people guilty of fraud are the birther `` experts '' ASPECT_NATURALBORN_ follow . 
2895	899	Yeah , the only thing Obama is guilty of is war crimes , taking bribes , and violating the constitutional rights of Americans via domestic spying . 
2896	899	God , if GONNA 're gonna hate and condemn the man , at least hate and condemn GOD for legitimate reasons . 
2897	899	The whole problem is there has n't been any CHANGE . 
2898	899	The only change is the change in ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ pocket that amounts to ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ life savings after being robbed by the capitalist class while Obama was picking REAGAN butt and being taught by Bill Clinton how to be the black Bill Clinton who REAGAN was the democratic Ronald Reagan . 
2899	899	Real change would be De-Reaganization . 
2900	901	ASPECT_DAN40_ clearly do not understand how the unemployment rate is determined . 
2901	901	RATE has nothing to do with collecting unemployment benefits or not . 
2902	901	RATE has to do with actively seeking employment vs not seeking employment . 
2903	901	There are some people who do want to work , but are not seeking work , who are not in the work force , but how do ASPECT_DAN40_ determine that number ? 
2904	901	WORK is impossible , so basically ASPECT_DAN40_ or some one else , just made that number up . 
2905	902	Frodly , there are people who believe that unemployment benefits are job creators too . 
2906	902	Do I have to prove what a stupid idea that is too ? 
2907	902	Some kinds of govt spending do stimulate the economy . 
2908	902	I never said SPENDING could n't . 
2909	902	Dollar for dollar , ASPECT_FRODLY_ ca n't beat DEFENSE spending for economic growth . 
2910	902	Another nice thing about defense spending is that THING is actually authorized by the Constitution . 
2911	902	I have no link to prove that the economy would be better off without the porkulus bill . 
2912	902	ASPECT_FRODLY_ have no link to prove that the economy would be worse . 
2913	902	I do n't see the point in butting heads . 
2914	902	POINT 's bizarre that ASPECT_FRODLY_ say I opinion is unprovable , but ASPECT_FRODLY_ is `` widely accepted to be true '' . 
2915	902	ASPECT_FRODLY_ want economic reasoning ? 
2916	902	How about human nature ? 
2917	902	That money will have to come from somewhere , frodly . 
2918	902	$ 800,000,000,000 . 
2919	902	We all know where MONEY will have to come from . 
2920	902	WE all know that budgets get bigger , not smaller . 
2921	902	Economic growth comes from risks . 
2922	902	There 's nothing in the porkulus bill that encourages risks . 
2923	902	The sheer size of BILL discourages risk . 
2924	902	SIZE 's human nature . 
2925	902	Go ahead and ignore SIZE . 
2926	902	Not I . 
2927	903	I have very simple economic reasoning to support I position . 
2928	903	The current economic crisis is not a supply problem , CRISIS is a matter of insufficient demand . 
2929	903	Government spending boosts aggregate demand , therefore boosting the economy . 
2930	903	Not only that , but unemployment insurance undoubtedly stimulates the economy . 
2931	903	There is no doubt that INSURANCE also offers a work disincentive , but in economic downturns , that disincentive is pretty irrelevant . 
2932	903	People are not out of work at the moment , because PEOPLE get unemployment insurance , and therefore have no reason to look for work . 
2933	903	PEOPLE are out of work , because the housing bubble burst , and we had a large economic downturn . 
2934	903	Removing or reducing unemployment benefits might cause a few people to get jobs PEOPLE are most likely overqualified for , but the reality is WE would till have millions of people who can not find work !! 
2935	903	What do ASPECT_THE12THMAN_ do with those people ? 
2936	903	If the government gives PEOPLE unemployment benefits , PEOPLE will spend that money , thereby stimulating the economy . 
2937	903	GOVERNMENT is n't that complicated either . 
2938	903	Unemployed people use the income PEOPLE receive from the government , which then increases demand , consumption , etc. . 
2939	903	Which then can create jobs . 
2940	903	While there is strong evidence to suggest it is a disincentive to work , DISINCENTIVE also certainly creates jobs for others !! 
2941	905	Just posting some info . 
2942	905	I never implied INFO to be gospel or a future prediction . 
2943	907	How did it costs jobs and prevent growth . 
2944	907	If that money had not been distributed in hundreds of billions in tax cuts and funds for projects and governments , please explain ASPECT_THE12THMAN_ scenario of how there would be more employment and growth . 
2945	908	Are ASPECT_IRIEMON_ just digging ? 
2946	908	If ASPECT_IRIEMON_ dispute the information , show INFORMATION to be wrong . 
2947	908	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ know , offer information . 
2948	908	Like show how much BO has spent of the almost Trillion dollar stimulus and how much BO has not spent . 
2949	908	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ know , the money BO needed right away to stimulate the economy and hold the unemployment rate to 8 % . 
2950	908	Yes to 8 % , LOL . 
2951	909	I did n't make the claim . 
2952	909	Proof that he has spend almost a trillion in stimulus ? 
2953	909	I do n't think PROOF is near that much . 
2954	910	Man , , if Obama is doing an impression of a sky diver holding a boulder than OBAMA is doing one hell of a good job ... LOLRemember folks , this is the man that was given a Nobel peace prize , and some University has OBAMA I believe 13 on FOLKS list of Great Presidents , that 's one above Reagan I believe ... LOLHow ASPECT_DAISYDOTELL_ get to be in that position and have well over half the country disagreeing with ASPECT_DAISYDOTELL_ two largest agendas -LRB- Health and immigration -RRB- I have no idea . 
2955	910	Then again we still do not know why OBAMA received the Nobel Peace prize . 
2956	910	Perhaps WE do know but rather not say ... All I know is if some couple has a purple child and becomes the first purple President than WE know where the next Nobel Peace prize will be going ... A sure winner \*\* 
2957	911	The govt spending money it does n't have is fake demand , frodly . 
2958	911	MONEY 's like a middle-class guy going out and getting a Lamborghini . 
2959	911	If that was true , why did n't the tax rebate create jobs ? 
2960	911	Remember everybody got 300-600 ? 
2961	911	Michelle Obama said once we bought earrings , ONCE would be gone . 
2962	911	At least that money was supposedly going to disposable income . 
2963	911	Unemployment benefits do not . 
2964	911	This kind of thinking has got to stop . 
2965	911	Real jobs are created by the private sector . 
2966	911	The private sector is not evil . 
2967	911	Make the argument all day long that unemployment helps people keep PEOPLE homes , but do n't believe ARGUMENT create jobs . 
2968	911	I 'm out of words . 
2969	911	Stop listening to those bozos and think . 
2970	912	But when the Govt spends , GOVT creates real jobs . 
2971	912	Ask the hundreds of thousands that work in the military industry . 
2972	913	No ASPECT_IRIEMON_ did n't . 
2973	913	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ just , typically , questioned the info without any rebuttal information . 
2974	913	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ are right , RIGHT is not that much . 
2975	913	But that is why BO said BO needed the money right away , RIGHT ? 
2976	913	To get the economy stimulated and hold unemployment to 8 % , RIGHT ? 
2977	913	Of course ECONOMY was . 
2978	913	A funny thing though , after getting BO `` stimulus '' passed right away , BO is still holding over half of the money . 
2979	913	STIMULUS wonder why ? 
2981	913	-LRB- not really -RRB- `` Stimulus Spending Update : $ 324 Billion of Recovery Act Funds SpentWed , 06\/30\/2010 - 15:00 adminRecovery Newsby Sebastian JonesThe Obama administration has spent close to $ 324 billion in stimulus funds , according to numbers from Recovery . 
2982	913	gov. The latest total includes $ 205 billion in spending and $ 119 billion in tax cuts . 
2983	913	Overall , just over 40 percent of the about $ 800 billion stimulus package has entered the economy . 
2984	913	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ can track stimulus spending by agency on our interactive Stimulus Progress Bar . 
2985	913	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ can also see how fast that money is moving out the door , by checking out OUR Stimulus Speed Chart . 
2986	913	`` http:\/\/www.coalitionforanaccountable...-recovery-act - 
2987	914	Yeah , that 's the way WAY works . 
2988	914	ASPECT_SURVEYBOB_ make the claim ASPECT_SURVEYBOB_ have the obligation to back WAY up , if ASPECT_SURVEYBOB_ expect anyone to believe OBLIGATION . 
2990	914	I thought ASPECT_SURVEYBOB_ were way off . 
2991	917	Well we somehow could afford the $ 10.6 trillion in debt run up by Republican policies prior to Obama taking office . 
2992	917	So I think WE can afford a fraction more of that . 
2993	917	But I certainly agree , Obama needs to raised taxes and trim spending to get the deficits down . 
2994	918	A little off topic but anyone who knows basic physics should get a kick out of that analogy . 
2995	919	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ skipped over some of my posts . 
2996	920	I was only addressing ASPECT_THE12THMAN_ first point . 
2997	920	But I comments on ASPECT_THE12THMAN_ second point are two :1 -RRB- ASPECT_THE12THMAN_ do n't know that the tax cuts did not create jobs . 
2998	920	They may have created lots of jobs , :1 just that the number of jobs being lost from the recession was greater until recently .2 -RRB- Tax cuts wo n't create more jobs in the near term if those who receive the tax cuts do n't spend the money and instead save MONEY or use MONEY to pay down debt , as was happening in this recession . 
2999	920	That 's why tax cuts are not a panacea and do n't work as well as direct spending for creating jobs in a recession . 
3000	921	-LRB- \/ quote -RRB- That policy used to have more validity than VALIDITY does today . 
3001	921	In years past , ASPECT_IRIEMON_ would give money to the people and PEOPLE would spend YEARS on American products . 
3002	921	That would create American jobs . 
3003	921	Now when Americans spend money NOW stimulates the Chinese economy . 
3004	921	The cycle now goes like this :1 -RRB- The American government borrows money from Social Security and gives GOVERNMENT to Americans .2 -RRB- Americans buy Asian cars and products .3 -RRB- Asian governments take the money and buy American TBills . 
3005	921	Did ASPECT_IRIEMON_ notice that the cycle begins and ends with a loan ? 
3006	921	Harvard did a study recently that showed that none of the economic theories were based on any substantial fact . 
3007	921	Tariffs are the only way to straighten out this mess .

3030	923	BO has ruined the auto industry . 
3031	923	Will soon ruin the financial industry . 
3032	923	Has bribed and coerced until BO got a law technically passed that will ruin the health care industry AND the insurance industry . 
3033	923	Has ignored and violated long established bankruptcy laws . 
3034	923	Desperately wants to cripple the energy industry . 
3035	923	Has ZERO respect for any law , US or otherwise . 
3036	923	He WILL raise taxes , HE WILL NOT cut spending -LRB- except defense spending , liberals ALWAYS do that -RRB- A brain damaged chimpanzee could have managed the BP spill better than BO has done . 
3037	923	The only part of that mess BO thinks is a coup for BO is the $ 20 billion slush fund BO got LIBERALS to commit to . 
3038	923	That should have gone through the courts . 
3039	923	But BO cares nothing for the law . 
3040	923	So no court involved , BP gives up $ 20 Billion . 
3042	923	Because BO was ` silly putty ' in the hands of smart businessmen . 
3043	923	Long before the meeting BUSINESSMEN decided how much BUSINESSMEN 'd go . 
3044	923	Might have been $ 35 Billion . 
3045	923	But BO said $ 20 B. Had BO demanded more than what BUSINESSMEN decided in advance BUSINESSMEN would have said , `` Good bye , See ASPECT_IRIEMON_ in court ! 
3046	923	`` Sues Az . 
3047	923	for a law telling Az state officers to UPHOLD THE NATIONAL LAW . 
3048	923	Does n't sue ` sanctuary cities ' that order law officers to VIOLATE the national immigration law . 
3049	923	Passes on the walk-over prosecution of the new black panther voter intimidation indictments . 
3050	923	-LRB- and lies about AND . -RRB- 
3051	923	Produces a fraudulent document recommending a moratorium on offshore drilling . 
3052	923	And does n't have the good sense to walk away from DOCUMENT when DOCUMENT is overturned and his appeal loses . 
3053	923	HIS disassociation with reality will become legendary in history . 
3054	923	And there is SO much more. , , , , , , , , , , , , , , 
3055	925	10.6 , but close enough . 
3056	925	Simplistic scapgoating for poltical purposes . 
3057	925	Blaming Obama for the auto industry for example is just inane . 
3058	926	Most college students are in the work force because ASPECT_NATURALBORN_ are counted as a part of the labor force if ASPECT_NATURALBORN_ are over 16 and ASPECT_NATURALBORN_ are looking for a job . 
3059	927	A references please . 
3060	927	This does not sound plausible . 
3062	930	No rant , just reality . 
3063	930	We have elected the worst POSSIBLE person as the President . 
3064	930	Gore , Hillary , or Kerry would have been better . 
3065	930	Instead WE elect a smooth talker with known corruption in GORE past and no known experience at anything except corrupt hardball politics and far left radicalism . 
3066	930	History will prove TALKER . 
3067	930	And Re : a post above , College students are NOT counted as part of the labor force . 
3068	930	Add STUDENTS in and the unemployment rate would climb to 22 % to 25 % but that would be unfair to BO . 
3069	930	The true numbers are indictment enough of BO inability to grasp reality . 
3070	931	Total US debt :01 \/ 16\/2009 10,628,881,485,510.23 Per US Treasury department . 
3071	931	http:\/\/www.treasurydirect.gov\/NP\/NPGateway All right . 
3072	931	US 'll call :01 opinionated blather instead of a rant . 
3073	932	That is silly ! 
3074	932	To disbelieve everyone without any proof ? 
3075	932	Well , not THAT ! 
3076	932	If THAT plan on challenging someone THAT show them why THAT have a challenge , with data\/facts . 
3077	932	Not just some baiting question ! 
3078	932	THAT was not off . 
3079	932	CHALLENGE is just as THAT said . 
3080	933	Suit ASPECT_SURVEYBOB_ . 
3081	933	If I make an assertion of fact , I back ASSERTION up if someone asks . 
3082	933	If someone makes a claim I think is dubious and they ca n't back CLAIM up with a source , that does n't convince I . 
3083	933	Maybe CLAIM does ASPECT_SURVEYBOB_ . 
3084	934	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ must be joking ? 
3085	934	Do ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ think the the Department of Labor uses some goofy blog for determining the range and qualifications of workers in the US ? 
3086	935	Well figuring the earth is covered by some 70 % ocean Id say he 'd be in a heap a trouble ... 
3087	936	What a hoot ! 
3088	936	So ASPECT_IRIEMON_ think asking a `` baited '' question is backing up something ? 
3089	936	Yeah right ! 
3090	936	Check out debate 101 ! 
3092	936	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ offer few points . 
3093	936	But plenty of baited questions . 
3094	936	WTG with ASPECT_IRIEMON_ -LRB- non -RRB- info ... ... LOL . 
3095	937	Uh , no , I do n't think that . 
3096	938	LOL , well ASPECT_IRIEMON_ do n't ! 
3097	938	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ just ask baiting questions ! 
3098	938	Time and again . 
3099	938	Post after post . 
3100	938	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ know everyone here is correct until proven incorrect . 
3101	938	Unless BAITER are a BAITER ! 
3102	939	I do n't ? 
3103	939	Feel free to demonstrate ASPECT_SURVEYBOB_ not just blowing smoke out of ASPECT_SURVEYBOB_ ass by citing some of I posts were someone asked I to back up a factual assertions I made and I did n't do FEEL . 
3104	940	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ post baiting question , after baiting question . 
3105	940	I probably can post 50 . 
3106	940	Just from the `` states posting surpluses '' thread alone . 
3108	940	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ really do not post much more than baiting questions . 
3109	940	Facts are facts . 
3110	940	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ do not seem to have them . 
3111	940	Just the history of ASPECT_IRIEMON_ posts dude . 
3113	940	Even ASPECT_IRIEMON_ can not dispute that . 
3115	940	But I hope ASPECT_IRIEMON_ handlers still pay ASPECT_IRIEMON_ . 
3116	940	HANDLERS must find some value -LRB- entertainment -RRB- in ASPECT_IRIEMON_ nonsense . 
3117	940	As we have seen , most here do not . 
3118	941	ASPECT_SURVEYBOB_ post baiting question , after baiting question . 
3119	941	I probably can post 50 . 
3120	941	Just from the `` states posting surpluses '' thread alone . 
3122	941	ASPECT_SURVEYBOB_ really do not post much more than baiting questions . 
3123	941	Facts are facts . 
3124	941	ASPECT_SURVEYBOB_ do not seem to have them . 
3125	941	Just the history of ASPECT_SURVEYBOB_ posts dude . 
3127	941	Even ASPECT_SURVEYBOB_ can not dispute that . 
3129	941	But I hope ASPECT_SURVEYBOB_ handlers still pay ASPECT_SURVEYBOB_ . 
3130	941	HANDLERS must find some value -LRB- entertainment -RRB- in ASPECT_SURVEYBOB_ nonsense . 
3131	941	As we have seen , most here do not . 
3132	941	ASPECT_SURVEYBOB_ do n't have to post 50 examples of I posts were someone asked I to back up a factual assertions I made and I did n't do 50 . 
3133	941	Just shoot for , say , 3 . 
3134	941	Just to show everyone on the board that ASPECT_SURVEYBOB_ posts are n't simply baiting . 
3135	942	sigh ... http:\/\/www.bls.gov\/cps\/cps_htgm.htm#conceptsI really get tried of doing people 's basic research for PEOPLE . 
3136	943	That link is BS . 
3137	943	The only time I 've been asked those questions -LRB- in the link -RRB- is while I 'm receiving unemployment compensation . 
3139	943	Once unemployment compensation ends , I 'm considered out of the work force . 
3141	943	End of valid argument . 
3142	946	So ASPECT_MERTEX_ would love one party rule too ?? 
3143	948	A poll of voters released today . 
3144	948	The question , In the NEXT -LRB- 2012 -RRB- Presidential election , would ASPECT_MERTEX_ vote for Obama or `` A Republican . '' 
3145	948	Not this Republican or that Republican , just `` A Republican . 
3146	948	`` The result ? 
3147	948	A Republican 42 % Obama 37 % obummer , can not even beat a ` generic ' Republican . 
3148	948	ASPECT_MERTEX_ 'd bet if OBUMMER was against , `` Another Democrat ? '' 
3149	948	obummer would lose that one too . 
3150	948	Had they asked , `` An Independent ? 
3151	948	`` obummer would have gotten blown off the board . 
3152	950	And the kicker is right now , the tide is favoring the GOP retaking at least the House in November , and not just the so-called `` establishment '' RINO Republicans , but far more Conservative Republicans to boot ! 
3153	951	http:\/\/www.politifact.com\/truth-o-meter\/promises\/ Many websites show how MAN is doing and what MAN has managed . 
3154	951	Look at MAN website , or the website I previously posted , or the library of Congress 's website . 
3155	951	This is and always has been Democratic policy . 
3156	951	Again , always has been Democratic policy , THIS saying MAN 's a bad man for following MAN own party 's policy . 
3157	951	Before MAN was elected , President Bush increased our debt to 10.3 trillion , today TRILLION is 13 trillion ... far less increase . 
3158	951	The only way OUR can be sure of that , is come November 2012 , otherwise OUR must assume that MAN is working with the backing of the majority of the American people . 
3159	951	By allowing Arizona to pass stricter immigration laws ? 
3160	951	Again , debatable , if ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ can name a few , I 'd be happy to debate FEW with ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ . 
3161	951	MAN actually has much better foreign diplomacy than OUR previous president , strengthening OUR claim in the UN and NATO and shifted OUR war to the homeland of OUR true enemy , rather than deceiving OUR into continuing a war previously though over . 
3162	951	Again , check the above website . 
3163	952	They get THEY news from Faux News , where everything is coming up roses for the right-wing - no such thing as reality for THEY . 
3164	952	THEY insensitivity to others is amazing - and I hope the Dems are able to capitalize on how the Republicans always seem to be on the side of the wealthy , the corporations and how little WEALTHY care about Americans . 
3165	952	That THEY do n't want to extend unemployment benefits to those that are hurting and accusing THEY of not looking for jobs , is just heartless . 
3166	952	A real eye-opener for most everyone . 
3167	953	I do n't like how the Republicans have been acting - they do n't deserve to be given control . 
3168	954	Was this a poll done by Faux News ? 
3169	956	He has not been transparent . 
3170	956	Only when pressured to do so . 
3171	956	This is why they need to be booted out of office . 
3172	956	Just wait : http:\/\/blog.heritage.org\/2010\/02\/05\/...s-in-pictures\/ HCR was shoved thru with the majority of Americans opposing Obamacare . 
3173	956	Even now , a majority of Americans want NOW repealed . 
3174	956	OBAMACARE did n't allow this . 
3175	956	OBAMACARE is suing to block the Arizona law . 
3176	956	Janet Napolitano , Obama 's DOHS Secretary , has weakened border security . 
3178	956	Cap & Trade . 
3180	956	Oh yeah , HCR is making friends all over the world . 
3181	956	ASPECT_T._HOBBES_ have n't been paying attention . 
3182	956	Quit watching MSLSD . 
3183	958	ASPECT_NATURALIST_ do realize the site ASPECT_NATURALIST_ just called BS is the site for the Bureau of Labor Statistics right ? 
3184	958	In otherwords ASPECT_NATURALIST_ just said the government agency responsible for counting unemployment rates is wrong about how unemployment rates are counted . 
3185	958	Do ASPECT_NATURALIST_ enjoy being laughably wrong ? 
3186	959	NO , it was NOT a FOX News poll . 
3187	959	FOX news , that ASPECT_MERTEX_ mindless liberals love to call Faux News , is burying what used to be the main stream media . 
3188	959	FOX continues to rise in ratings -LRB- even before BO -RRB- while NBC , CNN , ABC , and CBS plummet . 
3189	959	FOX is now the premier news source of the USA . 
3190	959	ASPECT_MERTEX_ might want to watch and find out what is REALLY going on . 
3191	959	FOX presents news , not news they like or dislike , THE NEWS . 
3192	959	The old , tired , failing , networks are now nothing but advertising agencies for the liberal left . 
3193	959	THEY no longer KNOW what news is , and THEY ca n't figure out why THEY are failing across the board . 
3194	959	Watch FOX and ASPECT_MERTEX_ 'll be shocked to find that Bill O'Rielly is as strong an Obama defender as ANYONE in the old media . 
3195	959	From the beginning of the BHO reign , O'Rielly has constantly said , `` Wait and see . '' 
3196	959	`` Give FOX a chance . '' 
3197	959	`` Obama is a very smart man . 
3198	959	`` On the other hand , Glenn Beck thinks and says BHO is a horror . 
3199	959	That is presenting 2 sides of a story . 
3200	959	Throughout the broadcast day FOX has on STAUNCH Democrats and near and far left liberals . 
3201	959	FAR give FAR a pulpit and let FAR present FAR ideology . 
3202	959	The lamestream media USED to do that , now FAR do n't . 
3203	959	On Glenn Beck , , , , , No one in the administration , or on the left has PROVED anything that Beck says to be a lie . 
3204	959	And BECK challenges FAR all to do so regularly . 
3205	959	The left CLAIMS BECK 's lying , but not once have FAR been able to say , `` Here is the fact proving Beck was lying . '' 
3206	959	Beck PROVES the administration is lying on an almost daily basis . 
3207	959	FOX presents BOTH sides , the rest present the liberal view ONLY . 
3208	959	FOX prospers , the rest slowly sink . 
3209	959	Keep calling them Faux News , THEM are laughing at ASPECT_MERTEX_ foolishly closed mind . 
3210	960	support ASPECT_SPACEMAN_ opinion please sir . 
3212	961	Even though these websites are run by his own personal staff or were set up before HIS even took office . 
3213	961	Also , how could there be so much criticism of President Obama if OBAMA was n't transparent . 
3214	961	because they disagree with ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ budgetary policies ? 
3215	961	Besides the fact that ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ 're quoting an opinion blog , ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ should really read the article . 
3216	961	FACT says OBAMA programs would push us $ 2.5 trillion dollars deeper into debt by 2020 . 
3217	961	In 8 years President Bush dropped US $ 10.3 trillion into debt . 
3218	961	Again , not a comparison . 
3219	961	HCR was passed through according to what 8 promised at the beginning of 8 campaign . 
3220	961	ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ 're claiming 8 's a bad person for sticking to 8 promises . 
3221	961	If 8 really wanted to block BEGINNING 8 could 've issued a presidential executive order . 
3222	961	One speech , law 's out . 
3223	961	HCR followed 'S promises 'S made during 'S campaign . 
3224	961	Cap and Trade is designed to get us off foreign oil dependency . 
3225	961	I thought thats what the majority of people wanted 'S never actually pardoned anybody . 
3226	961	'S threatened too , but never did . 
3227	961	Yah , YAH is = -RRB- Haha ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ have trouble distinguishing an independent from a democrat . 
3228	961	I watch Fox News , I also watch CNN , and do internet research . 
3229	962	Just read the posts on this forum . 
3230	963	He has not been transparent . 
3231	963	That is why HE gets the criticism . 
3232	963	The Dems want to spend , spend , spend and tax , tax , tax . 
3233	963	I disagree with that . 
3234	963	HCR was not passed , DEMS was shoved through . 
3235	963	The majority of folks opposed DEMS . 
3236	963	Link : http:\/\/www.rasmussenreports.com\/publ...th_care_reform He would get too much heat for that . 
3237	963	That is why HTTP:\/\/WWW.RASMUSSENREPORTS.COM\/PUBL...TH_CARE_REFORM is going through the courts . 
3238	963	Obamacare is opposed by the majority of Americans . 
3239	963	Cap & Trade will not reduce our dependency . 
3240	963	It is only another tax that will hurt companies , consumers , and OUR economy . 
3241	963	OBAMACARE is still not finished with trying to push through amnesty for illegals . 
3242	963	What a joke . 
3243	963	Then ASPECT_T._HOBBES_ had better start digesting the information because ASPECT_T._HOBBES_ are coming to false conclusions . 
3244	964	And that 's exactly why ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ know how HCR was `` pushed through '' and all about the new Cap and Trade bill and about Immigration . 
3245	964	Because THAT government is n't transparent ? 
3246	964	And that 's ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ right , do n't discredit a man by calling MAN unamerican because ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ disagree with MAN . 
3247	964	RIGHT will dwarf RIGHT ? 
3248	964	ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ blaming President Obama for something that President Bush started . 
3249	964	And as ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ 've seen , by ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ own website , President Obama 's spending plan will greatly minimize the rate of increase of our debt : the first step to decreasing WEBSITE . 
3250	964	I can not deny , that by ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ website , most Americans are against WEBSITE . 
3251	964	Please explain how HCR is pushed through when everybody but the President dislikes DISLIKES . 
3252	964	http:\/\/www.sightline.org\/research\/en...FRpTgwodfnN3gg DISLIKES not a tax . 
3253	964	HTTP:\/\/WWW.SIGHTLINE.ORG\/RESEARCH\/EN...FRPTGWODFNN3GG a government implanted business regulation . 
3254	964	Hmmm and yet HMMM not in the headlines any more ... The false conclusion that I have some trust in our President ? 
3255	964	And actually back PRESIDENT ? 
3256	965	I find out how this crap is on the table , and how bad CRAP is through the outlets that I watch\/listen to - not Obama or Congress . 
3257	965	Their goal is to keep us all in the dark and pass this destructive legislation with midnight\/weekend votes . 
3258	965	Obama is un-American because OBAMA is systematically destroying US Constitution and US liberties . 
3259	965	Yes , Obama will dwarf Bush 's contributions to US deficit . 
3260	965	THEIR will be record levels . 
3261	965	Democrats have no backbone , except the ones that voted against BACKBONE . 
3262	965	ONES accepted back-door deals from Obama , or were otherwise pressured into voting for BACKBONE . 
3263	965	ONES were sacrificed for the sake of Obamacare . 
3264	965	Businesses that have to pay additional if ONES exceed ONES credits , are essentially paying an energy tax . 
3265	965	ONES will recoup ONES money by passing additional costs to the consumer . 
3266	965	The price of products and services will go up . 
3267	965	Our energy consumption will not decrease . 
3268	965	Cap and Trade : Will CAP Save the Earth ? 
3269	965	http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=LPPVDOpFCIA CAP will be if the MSM covers MSM . 
3270	965	Hopefully , ASPECT_T._HOBBES_ will see the light . 
3271	966	And where do ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ outlets get it from ? 
3272	966	Oh right , Obama and Congress . 
3273	966	How else are they to be transparent , ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ want THEY to walk up to every person 's door and explain every point of THEY policy ? 
3274	966	The very thing that criticizes THEY , THEY must depend on for being transparent . 
3275	966	So far ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ have no proof to this . 
3276	966	He has offered no change to our Constitution and has n't removed a single liberty . 
3277	966	The website ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ posted already disproved this fact . 
3278	966	So HE convinced all the spineless Democrats to vote for Obamacare . 
3279	966	Yet there were some that voted against OBAMACARE . 
3280	966	With a need for a majority to pass Obamacare , and a Republican controlled Congress , how exactly was this forced through , with the full weight of R 's against THIS and some D 's as well ? 
3281	966	Then FAULT is not the President 's fault . 
3282	966	PRESIDENT has performed a measure that would be effective for decreasing energy consumption and also gain the government some more income . 
3283	966	FAULT is the companies ' fault for not following the set limit . 
3284	966	... what ? 
3285	966	Are ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ really trying to counter argue with simply saying a news media will report news ? 
3286	966	That just simply made my head hurt ... MY have , HURT 's quite dark , African American in fact ! 
3287	969	It is long because IT has to be . 
3288	969	We see how the Constitution and Bill of Rights are extensively malleable and dependent on someone 's perception . 
3289	969	If a bill passes now-a-days , BILL must be watertight to avoid such flexibility , and that makes a bill long . 
3290	969	As for the loopholes , in any bill , there are compromises . 
3291	969	With a bill as controversial as this one and enacted right after a very tense and violent campaign , Congressmen are likely to compromise over the bill . 
3292	969	Also CONGRESSMEN add unneeded amendments and money spending called pork barrel . 
3293	969	This is done mainly by those who are against the bill in hopes of getting THIS voted down . 
3294	969	ASPECT_DAN40_ are generally insulting an entire government , simply because GOVERNMENT opposition put up a fight . 
3295	970	Did ASPECT_THE12THMAN_ know that if ASPECT_THE12THMAN_ went to the library of Congress ASPECT_THE12THMAN_ can read every single bill that is currently being voted on ? 
3296	970	Also ASPECT_THE12THMAN_ can analyze who put LIBRARY up for vote , where LIBRARY is in the voting process , how many nays and ayes there are currently for CURRENTLY , who wrote CURRENTLY and which party they are , when CURRENTLY was introduced , which companies\/people are backing the bill , which committee the bill is under , who heads that committee , what that persons political stance on the bill is , how much this bill will cost , who will be paying for COMMITTEE , and approximately how long CURRENTLY will be till CURRENTLY takes effect . 
3297	970	Just because President Obama does n't force Congress to give a daily televised speech on the thousands of bills that pass through CONGRESS , does n't mean that CONGRESS is not becoming more transparent . 
3298	971	Barack once promised that every non-emergency bill to come before BARACK would be posted on the WH site for 5 days before BARACK signed SITE . 
3299	971	Took BARACK about one week to break that promise . 
3300	971	BARACK 's broken ABOUT numerous times since . 
3301	971	For that matter , has BARACK ever put even one bill on the WH website 5 days before signing MATTER ? 
3302	971	Kinda funny watching that video NOW . 
3303	971	I do n't think KINDA 's a big deal that BARACK does n't post bills for public input . 
3304	971	BARACK does n't give a crap what people say anyway . 
3305	972	Kinda funny that people believed he would have time to and that people find TIME prudent to look on the executive branch 's website for a legislative matter . 
3306	973	So ASPECT_T._HOBBES_ knew he was lying ? 
3307	973	Have ASPECT_T._HOBBES_ ever looked ? 
3308	973	HE does post bills there . 
3309	973	Just not for 5 days . 
3310	974	No , I did n't , but NO like getting a great dinner and complaining ASPECT_THE12THMAN_ did n't get desert . 
3311	974	Good for him ! 
3312	974	I 'm glad HIM does , just wondering why people truly expect an executive website to be solely responsible for reports on legislative matters . 
3313	975	From inauguration , BO had total control of both the House and Senate . 
3314	975	The Democrats could pass any bill they wished in a totally partisan manner . 
3315	975	The Republicans could grumble , but were powerless to stop or even delay , any legislation from day one . 
3316	975	Yet DAY took BO over a year to pass BO signature Health Care bill . 
3317	975	And to pass DAY , a number of DEMOCRATS had to be bribed and coerced and promised who knows what as a group of them SUDDENLY decided to vote for the HCR and RETIRE . 
3318	975	Net result is a bill that only messes up the health care system and will likely forever change health care insurance , and not for the better . 
3319	975	That is not good Government . 
3320	975	The PEOPLE said PEOPLE did NOT want that Health Care bill . 
3321	975	And now The People say PEOPLE want the bill repealed and a real bi-partisan bill worked out . 
3322	975	BO refused to listen , then and now ! 
3323	975	The people WILL speak in November and BO will be forced to listen as BO becomes essentially a lame duck halfway through BO ONLY term . 
3324	976	Republicans have just as much right in Congress to fillibuster , pork barrel , amend , and debate the hell out of any bill , which is probably what happened to this bill . 
3325	976	As for bribery and all these other ridiculous claims , has anyone had charges brought against them ? 
3326	976	Anyone been sued ? 
3327	976	Anyone confronted with evidence ? 
3328	976	Or are these innocuous claims thrown out into the public for the benefit of our great and benevolent leader ? 
3329	977	Try this . 
3330	977	YES voted for President Obama . 
3331	977	On one hand OBAMA is too liberal for YES , and on the other too conservative . 
3332	977	OBAMA is too conservative because OBAMA let Wall Street walk all over OBAMA , when YES was expecting OBAMA to kick some corporate ass . 
3333	977	OBAMA is too liberal for YES because OBAMA sent the Attorney General to Arizona to sue and stop the Arizona immigration law . 
3334	977	The border is out of control , and Obama should be trying to work with Governor Jan Brewer to clean up the criminal illegal alien and anchor baby mess . 
3335	977	OBAMA did get health care passed which was a major issue for YES . 
3336	977	Will YES vote for President Obama again ? 
3337	977	YES answered `` yes , '' because YES believe Obama\/Biden will see the light with the help of American labor when OBAMA\/BIDEN comes to the issue of illegals . 
3338	977	If OBAMA does not , YES may shop around . 
3339	977	Under no circumstances will YES vote for Sarah Palin for political office . 
3340	977	She is simply incompetent . 
3341	977	Some YES know are talking of not voting at all . 
3342	977	YES used to think that was wrong . 
3343	978	They were supposed to televise all the HCR debates on C-SPAN and post the bills with sufficient time for the American People to see THEY . 
3344	978	THEY did not do this . 
3345	978	THEY finally started to post some items , but with only a few days til voting . 
3346	978	Not enough time . 
3347	978	VOTING 's a work in progress . 
3348	978	HCR is one example . 
3349	978	He has appointed two judges to the Supreme Court who can not uphold the Constitution , and will legislate from the bench . 
3350	978	ASPECT_T._HOBBES_ 're misreading TWO apparently then . 
3351	978	Quit looking at TWO upside down . 
3352	978	ASPECT_T._HOBBES_ apparently did n't watch the video . 
3353	978	ASPECT_T._HOBBES_ lost me on this one . 
3354	979	The most that the Executive branch can do is open the court doors to the media , they can not force THEY to come and people to watch . 
3355	979	In fact much of the time FACT WAS televised on C-Span but THEY promised live coverage and votes were being done at unreasonable hours . 
3356	979	I believe he promised w \/ in 5 days , aka a few days . 
3357	979	And ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ 're saying it is n't THEY right to do so ? 
3358	979	I 'm confused , ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ seem to believe that the President has enormous legislative power , and yet the judicial branch has none . 
3359	979	I did more than look at the graph , I read the referenced article and hmm : '' -LRB- Raise -RRB- the publicly held national debt to over $ 18 trillion . '' 
3360	979	GRAPH was at $ 10.3 trillion dollars when handed over to PRESIDENT ... seems that PRESIDENT clocks in at $ 8 trillion , significantly less than our warmongering previous leader . 
3361	979	As of 2010 ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ 're quite right . 
3362	979	But what of PRESIDENT first two years ? 
3363	979	ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ are quite right , I did not . 
3364	979	I refuse to let somebody let something else debate for them . 
3365	979	If ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ wish to quote the video and reference VIDEO , fine . 
3366	979	I was arguing that the President had given up on PRESIDENT attempts , and backed VIDEO up by saying it was so high profile VIDEO would still be in the news if PRESIDENT were still trying . 
3367	979	And ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ said yes YES would be if MSM covered YES ... ? 
3369	980	Obama was less than sincere on OBAMA promise to be transparent . 
3370	980	Obama apparently has a lot of influence on OBAMA herd of sheep in Congress . 
3371	980	The SCOTUS is supposed to interpret the law and abide by our Constitution . 
3372	980	They can not legislate nor re-write the Constitution in THEY actions . 
3373	980	Where do ASPECT_T._HOBBES_ come up with $ 10.3 trillion for Bush ? 
3374	980	Article from 2009 : http:\/\/content.usatoday.com\/communit...10\/620000005\/1Another: http:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/8301-503544_1...97-503544.html Both Houses of Congress have been under Dem control since Obama took office . 
3375	980	ARTICLE 's informative . 
3376	980	ASPECT_T._HOBBES_ can learn from ARTICLE . 
3377	980	However , in a nutshell : Cap & Trade = Massive Energy Tax . 
3378	980	Article : http:\/\/online.wsj.com\/article\/SB123655590609066021.html He is still pushing for Cap & Trade . 
3379	980	ARTICLE just has another name nowadays : American Power Act . 
3380	981	And yet he 's fulfilled it . 
3381	981	The ruling of the Supreme Court has the same weight as our written Constitution , and under activist judges , the Supreme court has seen fit to interpret laws in quite a liberal fashion . 
3382	981	These interpretations include Roe v Wade with the creation of the law that a women has a right to control her own body , and Gibbons v Ogden and the widening of the meaning of `` interstate commerce '' to mean pretty much anything that passed between states , including people . 
3383	981	http:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/8301-500803_1...28-500803.html&quot;In fact WADE was just two months ago , on July 30 , that President Bush signed the Housing and Economic Recovery Act , which contained a provision raising the debt ceiling to $ 10.615 trillion `` Sorry , ROE underestimated . 
3384	981	This website also shows that the bailout was legislation started and pushed through by Bush , not Obama Actually in the 2007 - 09 years , there was an equal Senate with two Libertarians , effectively a Republican controlled Senate . 
3385	981	Mind ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ this was the year that HCR passed . 
3386	981	So let ROE get this straight . 
3387	981	Cap and Trade is a limit put on companies and if those companies exceed those limits that have to pay a fee . 
3388	981	CAP is not a tax . 
3389	981	Too bad we were n't talking about that . 
3390	983	Obama will not go down in history as the worst president in history , I am pretty sure George W Bush Jr. will beat Obama by a landslide on this one . 
3391	984	they both have to beat Franklin PierceJimmy CarterJames BuchananHerbert Hooverwe wont truly know the impact of Obamas presidency for a few more years . 
3392	985	Not technically a tax . 
3393	985	WE will pay a fine for over use of carbon . 
3394	985	That extra cost will be reflected in higher prices we all , including the poorest among us , will get to pay . 
3395	985	And there is no possible argument that the increased cost will not be passed on to the consumers -LRB- US ! -RRB- 
3396	985	ORCompanies will go to an energy exchange company , like CCX , and TRADE carbon credits after ORCOMPANIES have exceeded ORCOMPANIES CAP . 
3397	985	CCX stands to make Billions off a CAP & TRADE law . 
3398	985	And big surprise , who was very involved in the financing and establishment of the CCX ? 
3399	985	And sharing in those BILLIONS will be a private citizen that helped establish the CCX . 
3400	985	CITIZEN name is B. H. Obama . 
3401	986	Far from it . 
3402	986	ASPECT_T._HOBBES_ 're delusional on this one . 
3403	986	They are supposed to interpret the Constitution and rule by CONSTITUTION , not change CONSTITUTION . 
3404	986	Bush certainly had BUSH spending problems , no doubt , but Obama is going to town on spending - Vegas style . 
3405	986	The Senate was not controlled by the Republicans . 
3406	986	The House was controlled by the Dems . 
3407	986	The House essentially passed the bill with HOUSE Democratic majority . 
3408	986	The Senate just had to vote on a reconciliatory package , where they only needed 51 votes . 
3409	986	Call SENATE what ASPECT_T._HOBBES_ want . 
3410	986	SENATE 's a tax , and SENATE will hit us all as THEY pass the extra costs to the consumer . 
3411	986	SENATE 's all the same thing . 
3412	987	I suppose ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ suggestion is Palin ? 
3413	987	BwahahaAnd ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ think ONES are the ones that need mental treatment . 
3414	988	A poll last week pitted BO against ANY Republican . 
3415	988	BO lost by 5 percentage points to ANY Republican . 
3416	988	Now that 's Bwahaha 
3417	989	According to this list , Carter was ranked # 32 while Geroge Bush came in at # 37 ! 
3418	989	Carter is listed as an-also-ran while George Bush is listed as one of the worst . 
3419	989	http:\/\/www.timesonline.co.uk\/tol\/new...cle5029204.eceAccording to this list of 10 worst , neither Carter nor Bush made LIST , but Nixon did # 9 - I noticed ASPECT_SHAKER154_ did n't list NIXON ?

3421	989	Survey of historians : Obama the 15th greatest president of all timePOSTED AT 8:28 PM ON JULY 1 , 2010 BY ALLAHPUNDIT A solid B + ? 
3422	989	In office for barely two years , Obama entered the survey in the 15th position two spots behind Bill Clinton and three spots ahead of Ronald Reagan . 
3423	989	Obama got high marks for intelligence , ability to communicate and imagination , but OBAMA score was dragged down by OBAMA relative lack of experience and family background -LRB- T -RRB- OBAMA scholars rated Dubya a dud as a president , ranking DUBYA in the bottom five at 39th place Bush got docked for saddling Obama with two bloody wars and a recession , and OBAMA got low marks for ability to compromise , foreign policyaccomplishments and intelligence , according to the survey . 
3424	989	Only Warren G. Harding , who was 41st on the list , scored lower in the intelligence category . 
3425	989	http:\/\/hotair.com\/archives\/2010\/07\/0...t-of-all-time\/A new poll of leading presidential scholars ranks Barack Obama as the 15th best president of the United States , just below Bill Clinton but ahead of Ronald Reagan .

3427	990	Was that a Faux News poll or at one of the Tea Parties ? 
3429	990	Survey Ranks Obama 15th Best President , Bush Among WorstFormer President George W. Bush is in the bottom 5By MALLIE JANE KIMPosted : July 2 , 2010President Obama ranks 15th out of 44 in a poll of the best and worst presidents while former President George W. Bush earns a place in the bottom five , according to the Siena College Research Institute 's recent survey of 238 presidential scholars released Thursday . 
3430	990	-LRB- See a slide show of the 10 Worst Presidents . -RRB- 
3431	991	Was that a Faux News poll or at one of the Tea Parties ? 
3433	991	The ONLY answer ASPECT_MERTEX_ liberals seem to be able to conjure up and ANSWER is incorrect . 
3434	991	Not a FAX News poll or a tea party poll . 
3435	991	An independent poll . 
3436	991	MJ KIM a liberal left wing writer . 
3437	991	Her opinion is supposed to mean something ? 
3438	991	Not to anyone rational . 
3439	992	YES said `` yes . '' 
3440	992	Because ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ see the right can not think for RIGHT . 
3441	992	Whatever the Fox talking points are for the day , ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ push DAY in here . 
3442	992	YES voted for Obama because YES wanted the health care reform , and YES am very happy . 
3443	992	Obama is down in the polls because of unemployment . 
3444	992	Unless the Republicans can come up with a few million jobs before the November election , the Democrats will stay in charge . 
3445	992	YES God ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ party does not even have a leader ! 
3446	992	People are running around yelling ` Neocon , ' ` Libertarian , ' or ` Tea Bagger ! ' 
3447	992	Republicans are a mess and on the brink of shutting down . 
3448	992	Sarah Palin indeed ! 
3449	992	See , YES can make up YES mind for YES . 
3450	992	YES differ from the main stream of the Democratic Party and support the Arizona immigration law . 
3451	992	Myself and other Dems do not want to get too close because the idiot Tea Baggers who have covered the issue with racist stink , which we will not tolerate . 
3452	992	And , the fact that ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ point man , Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County , -LRB- Phoenix -RRB- , treats ARPAIO prisoners with `` cruel and unusual punishment , '' and is thoroughly corrupt , does not offer the left the confidence WE are looking for . 
3453	992	Unless Arizona gets the Arizona immigration law OUT of bungler Joe Arpio 's hands and under the control of Governor Jan Brewer , the whole thing will go down the toilet . 
3454	992	If that happens the Dems will pick up some seats in Congress . 
3455	992	Another Republican disgrace like John McCain or George Bush . 
3456	992	Now , where did historicus leave off ? 
3457	992	Oh , yes someone needs mental treatment . 
3458	992	YES think ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ are correct . 
3459	992	Start with the RNC . 
3460	993	i did get number 2 and 3 though . 
3462	993	I completely forgot about hardings corrupt admin . 
3463	994	I ca n't quote all ASPECT_DAN40_ statements since ASPECT_DAN40_ posted it kinda weird but I 'll do I best . 
3464	994	President Bush was also notorious for keeping the Iraq War off the books , which kept the numbers lower . 
3465	994	And yes I can , Bush increased NOTORIOUS 71.9 % over FOUR years , this report was only on BUSH second term , considering we actually had a surplus after Clinton . 
3466	994	Obama has increased NOTORIOUS a little under 40 % in two years , so a little over Bush , I mistake . 
3467	994	As for the second : http:\/\/www.infoplease.com\/ipa\/A0774721.htmlAnd those higher prices will drive consumers , hopefully , to those companies who can stay under CONSUMERS limit . 
3468	994	Therefore the responsible companies will rise to the top . 
3469	994	Oh please , Presidents use PRESIDENTS position to gain money all the time for PRESIDENTS constituents , like any politician . 
3470	994	What about Bush hiring Cheney 's company to fight the war in Iraq ? 
3471	995	Well that debate was effectively ended . 
3472	995	By interpreting the Constitution , they essentially change CONSTITUTION . 
3473	995	THEY can change the meanings of the laws . 
3474	995	CONSTITUTION called an activist court . 
3475	995	And yet most of the debt currently attributed to Obama , came from Bush 's stimulus package . 
3476	995	`` By 2020 , the annual deficit as a percentage of GDP will be 5.6 % , according to the CBO . 
3477	995	The White House estimates HOUSE will be 4.2 % . 
3478	995	`` If ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ read farther into the article ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ would notice that ARTICLE shows when Obama was confronted with the projections ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ mentioned OBAMA : `` has created a fiscal advisory commission to recommend ways lawmakers can get annual deficits down to 3 % of GDP by 2015 . '' 
3479	995	http:\/\/www.infoplease.com\/ipa\/A0774721.htmlOkay how a bill works is this , both chambers vote on an identical versions of a bill , ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ each make ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ own amendments and changes and then ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ switch , and each chamber changes the other version . 
3480	995	If , at the end , the two versions are n't the same , ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ get called into a conference where a unanimous vote is needed to get VOTE passed . 
3481	995	Also , a majority vote is needed to make any changes . 
3482	995	So while the Dems may have had control in the House , ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ would need control in the Senate to `` push the bill through '' without a good amount of help from the Repubs . 
3483	995	Not to mention the fact that , as ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ claimed , many Dems voted against FEE . 
3484	995	FEE 's not a tax . 
3485	995	FEE 's a fee under circumstances . 
3486	995	A tax is forced , a fee is optional . 
3487	995	Yes , Cap and Trade is exactly the same as amnesty for Immigrants . 
3488	996	Yes , with the conclusion that Obama has n't been very transparent . 
3489	996	OBAMA is only being forced to be more transparent now from pressure to do so , but OBAMA certainly was n't in the first 18 months of OBAMA Presidency . 
3490	996	Interpreting the Constitution does NOT imply changing the Constitution . 
3491	996	The SCOTUS is NOT supposed to be activist . 
3492	996	They are the Judicial Branch , not the Legislative Branch . 
3493	996	ASPECT_T._HOBBES_ are talking about `` annual deficit '' numbers . 
3494	996	The `` national debt '' is still projected to be 90 % of GDP by 2020 . 
3495	996	The 111th Congress voted on HCR . 
3496	996	There were 57 Democratic Senators . 
3497	996	All SENATORS needed was 51 votes for reconciliation . 
3498	996	If SENATORS exceed SENATORS caps , SENATORS will be subject to the fees , which are mandatory at that point , not optional . 
3499	996	It is essentially a tax on over-production that will be passed on to the consumer via goods and services . 
3500	996	Apparently , we were not on the same page with this one . 
3501	997	And what did the health insurance debacle actually do for ASPECT_BATTEN_ ? 
3502	997	What DEBACLE did for me is cut medicare spending on dialysis . 
3503	997	Thanks obamination , peeelooosiii and that dickwart reid . 
3504	997	Has anyone seen a list of which traitors cheered that mexican dirt bag that chastised us in US house ? 
3505	997	ME think LIST 's important to know exactly who is a treasonous POS . 
3506	997	Besides obama . 
3507	998	From the same article : The CBO cited two big contributors to the jump in debt . 
3508	998	One is the president 's proposal to extend the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts for the majority of Americans . 
3509	998	The other is the proposal to protect middle - and upper-middle-income families from having to pay the Alternative Minimum Tax -LRB- AMT -RRB- . 
3510	998	Together those proposals would cost $ 3 trillion between 2011 and 2020 . 
3511	998	The biggest causes for the projected increase in deficits are maintaining tax cuts . 
3512	998	In spite of his promise , Obama should follow Clinton 's proposal and just repeal the Bush tax cuts in FAMILIES entirety . 
3513	998	Or HIS has to compensate for keeping a portion of FAMILIES with higher taxes on the wealthy . 
3514	1000	VETERAN am a veteran and while VETERAN am grateful for the VA healthcare system if this is a preview of socialized medicine we are all gonna die sick . 
3515	1000	VETERAN have been waiting over a year on a revision of VETERAN total replacement . 
3516	1000	To VETERAN horror HORROR has become infected which means if VETERAN do not lose VETERAN entire leg HORROR will highly complicate the procedure as well as make HORROR much more expensive -LRB- nearly three times what THREE would have cost if VETERAN would of had the op in a timely fashion -RRB- . 
3517	1000	At least the VA not mandatory forcing VETERAN a so called free man in a so called free country to buy insurance for sub par medical procedures if and when VETERAN get INFECTED . 
3518	1000	What a atrocity the health care bill is ! 
3519	1000	Not just the idea of socialization medicine but the draconian way the totalitarian powers that be forced IDEA on a disproving nation . 
3522	1001	.2 was n't MJ Kim 's opinion , but 238 Presidential scholars .2 . 
3523	1001	ASPECT_DAN40_ did n't show any proof that MJ Kim was a liberal writer .3 . 
3524	1001	Since she did n't make up the list , but just reported on LIST , does LIST really matter ? 
3526	1001	SHE opinion matters to those of rational minds - ergo , ASPECT_DAN40_ comments . 
3527	1002	Scholars = liberals . 
3528	1002	Which is exactly why BO is f \*\*\* ing up so much . 
3529	1002	BO has no practical experience at anything but elections . 
3530	1002	So BO must refer to books to find any ideas . 
3531	1002	If BO calls in an `` expert , '' EXPERIENCE is an academic . 
3532	1002	Equally lacking in anything but book knowledge . 
3533	1002	Leadership is not in a book . 
3534	1002	So BO is lost in the job that is way over BO head . 
3535	1002	BO forte , elections , is why in this troubled time , BO just keeps on making campaign speeches , trying to get elected to the job BO already has and can not handle . 
3536	1002	Did ASPECT_MERTEX_ take note of the poll results ? 
3537	1002	65 % against BO . 
3538	1002	That is reflective of the USA , not just this poll . 
3539	1002	The dummy must be voted out . 
3540	1003	Tax relief for Americans is a good thing in times of economic hardship , not tax increases . 
3541	1003	Do n't worry , ASPECT_IRIEMON_ 'll be able to pay more in taxes soon , starting 1\/1\/2011 . 
3542	1006	If only ASPECT_THEDEM_ could vote twice too eh ? 
3543	1007	He 's a Dem . 
3544	1007	HE probably did !! 
3545	1008	Republican\/conservative rhetoric not substantiated with facts other than the same BS being spewed on Faux News , repeated by the parrot sheeple . 
3546	1008	Obama has more knowledge than Bush , Chaney and McCain put together and cons ca n't stand the fact that we now have a President that can actually make a cohesive sentence and pronounce words accurately . 
3547	1008	Keep fooling ASPECT_DAN40_ , and when November comes around ASPECT_DAN40_ can continue saying `` wait till next time '' ! 
3549	1009	Liberals continue the nonsense of living in the past and comparing obummer with Bush , Cheney , or whomever . 
3550	1009	Conservative INDEPENDENTS as HE am compare obummer to reality . 
3551	1009	And the reality is that he CAN orate well , stop . 
3552	1009	But that 's REALITY . 
3553	1009	Other than being capable of reading a teleprompter extremely well , he brings no skills to the job . 
3554	1009	If ASPECT_MERTEX_ vision was not obscured by ideology , ASPECT_MERTEX_ would be able to see that . 
3555	1009	In 1.5 years 1.5 has passed by parliamentary trick a health care bill the the COUNTRY does not want and Financial reform that was also NOT wanted AND NOT NEEDED . 
3556	1009	And a Stimulus bill that DID NOT WORK . 
3557	1009	1.5 has made the US a non-leader internationally and a world-wide joke . 
3558	1009	1.5 has committed a protocol GAFF in each and every meeting with a foreign official . 
3559	1009	In the BP disaster , 1.5 took over 60 days to START to get involved . 
3560	1009	Other than using the spill to forge a document and defraud Congress and the American people by 1.5 drilling moratorium which was NOT RECOMMENDED by the experts that obummer and the Interior Sec . 
3561	1009	said PEOPLE did . 
3562	1009	Both should be indited for lying to Congress . 
3563	1009	On immigration , 1.5 ignores the many cities VIOLATING Federal law , AND SUES THE STATE OF AZ . 
3564	1009	that is attempting to assist the Feds , as Federal law suggests . 
3565	1009	And 1.5 now has unemployment benefits up to 123 weeks with no way to pay that bill . 
3566	1009	1.5 and other conservative Independents could fill enough pages to rival a liberal Congressional bill just listing the errors of commission and omission by this obviously incompetent clown . 
3567	1011	Nationally , Liberals are down to 20 % . 
3568	1011	Conservatives and relatively conservative Independents make up the rest of the country . 
3569	1011	In less than a year , the country SAW what liberal political control was and we did n't like YEAR at all . 
3570	1011	YEAR is too expensive and does n't work . 
3571	1011	Liberalism sounds wonderful , but IS completely impractical . 
3572	1011	And YEAR been exposed by the dummy in the WH . 
3573	1012	True ... the last numbers I saw were 21 % libs , 40 % conservatives , and 35 % a mixture of right and left leaning independants . 
3574	1012	But is n't MIXTURE going a little far for ASPECT_DAN40_ to assume ASPECT_DAN40_ can speak for 80 % of Americans by saying `` WE '' do n't like liberal control ? 
3575	1012	How can ASPECT_DAN40_ know that all moderates come down on the side of conservatism ? 
3576	1012	I could n't find any polls that talked about how many liberals , moderates , or conservatives thought liberal control is bad . 
3577	1013	ALL polls showing 50 + % and up dissatisfaction are n't convincing enough for ASPECT_GOLDWATER_ ? 
3578	1013	When this poll is finished , then ASPECT_GOLDWATER_ 'll know , the poll called the Nov. election . 
3579	1015	Shpraralain , Very well put . 
3580	1015	If that was to happen I would vote for SHPRARALAIN . 
3581	1017	Reagan 's polls at this point in REAGAN presidency were the same or worse . 
3582	1017	So what is ASPECT_DAN40_ point ? 
3583	1018	HERE 've already been here , Irie . 
3584	1018	If Barack does the things that Reagan did , I hope BARACK wins in a landslide . 
3585	1019	We have already been there , like about 99 &#37; of what is written in this forum . 
3586	1019	People keep saying the same thing . 
3587	1019	What does that have to do with the fact that both are polling about the same at this point in BOTH presidencies ? 
3589	1020	Because they are 2 different people and will do completely different things , why is Reagan 's rating at any time relevant to Barack 's rating ? 
3590	1021	That 's why THAT like it . 
3591	1021	IT a refreshing change from the other MSNBC pie holes type forums , no pie hole is too nice , ummm poo holes type forums . 
3592	1021	While THAT do not love all of FOX News THAT do think overall CHANGE a much better and infinitely more wachable news show than the entirely worthless and repulsive MSNBC atrocity masquerading as a News channel .

3597	1022	So ASPECT_SHPRARALAIN_ would vote for him if HIM abandoned HIM own principles , adopted all ASPECT_SHPRARALAIN_ principles , not matter how idiotic and wrongheaded those principles were ? 
3598	1022	That is a pretty nonsensical point of view . 
3599	1022	If Obama adopted those measures , especially the ones about deporting people and economic regression that would come about from stopping free trade , I would sooner vote for I dog as a write in than Obama under those circumstances . 
3600	1022	I also like the fact that right wingers constantly blather on about the free market . 
3601	1022	And yet in action , and even specific policy rhetoric WINGERS oppose the free market at every turn . 
3602	1022	Opposition to free trade , is opposition to the free market . 
3603	1022	Opposition to the free movement of labor is opposition to the free market . 
3604	1022	That is why I can not stomach the hypocritical right wing stupidity . 
3605	1022	They claim to support a free market , and yet THEY oppose the free market all THEY time . 
3606	1022	THEY claim to be in favor of freedom , but THEY oppose freedom all the time . 
3607	1022	The reality is , the right wing agenda can be summed up as , `` I want a free market for I , I do n't care about anyone else . 
3608	1022	And I want freedom for I , I do n't care about anyone else . 
3609	1022	Unless of course I need government assistance like unemployment , SS , or Medicare , then I love government -LRB- but ASSISTANCE should n't benefit the poor or brown , then I will oppose BROWN -RRB- . 
3610	1023	ASPECT_THE12THMAN_ mean he does all the things that led to this recession ? 
3611	1023	We already witnessed the long term effects of reagans irrational economic policies . 
3612	1023	REAGANS were disastrous . 
3613	1023	No one who properly understands that could possibly want Obama to follow that disastrous path . 
3614	1024	Never in ASPECT_THEDEM_ lifetime have conservatives held power . 
3615	1024	Do not confuse CONSERVATIVES with Republicans . 
3616	1024	After the last several years , we can all see the destruction that liberal , progressive , marxist , and\/or communist policies cause - when CONSERVATIVES run the Executive , House , and Senate 
3618	1025	Another person irrelevantly pointing out fox news ratings , and comparing them to MSNBC . 
3619	1025	I am very liberal , and would n't watch MSNBC for any reason . 
3620	1025	I actually watch Fox significantly more often . 
3621	1025	And if there is a major and serious news story , I watch CNN . 
3622	1025	That is the difference between the right and left . 
3623	1025	Most left wingers think for WINGERS , WINGERS do n't let a TV news channel think for WINGERS . 
3625	1026	And no where in my post did MY suggest that . 
3626	1026	But from ASPECT_MERTEX_ posts we can all easily conclude that ASPECT_MERTEX_ must be another Obama boot licker too dimwitted to understand the mistake ASPECT_MERTEX_ made . 
3627	1026	At the time Obama appeared to have outmaneuvred Hillary but was not yet the nominee MY summed up how dangerous LICKER Presidency might become based on LICKER inexperience , lack of pragmatism , and liberal ideology . 
3628	1026	TIME did not take MY 1 year into 1 Presidency to feel vindicated of the predictions MY made during 1 campaign . 
3629	1026	The mistakes are frequent , and damaging to the Republic . 
3630	1027	Because it shows that notwithstanding the fact that Obama 's lower ratings are constantly posted to show what a crummy job OBAMA is doing , ratings at this point in OBAMA tenure are likely to bear little resemblance to how OBAMA is judged in the future . 
3632	1028	Is that why most Obama voters actually thought Sara Palin said she could see Russia from SHE house in Alaska ? 
3633	1028	That is based on a Zogby study post election . 
3634	1028	The data is on line if ASPECT_FRODLY_ want ELECTION . 
3635	1028	I guess ASPECT_FRODLY_ liberals let Saturday Night Live create reality for ASPECT_FRODLY_ . 
3636	1029	It was n't a liberal policy to slash tax revenues and double military spending . 
3637	1029	BABY can understanding , looking back at the wreckage that is the Bush administration , why conservatives would now what to distance CONSERVATIVES and claim BUSH was a `` liberal . 
3638	1029	`` Sorry . 
3639	1029	BABY 's ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ baby . 
3640	1029	ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ all put BABY in office twice . 
3641	1029	We do n't want BABY . 
3642	1030	ASPECT_FRODLY_ nailed it . 
3643	1030	Private Sector expansion is exactly the opposite of the current regimes goals 
3644	1031	Stop projecting . 
3645	1031	Bush , like it or not , was one of the most Liberal Republicans ever elected . 
3646	1031	And never during BUSH Presidency , were either Chambers of Congress , run by Conservatives . 
3647	1031	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ may be able to rewrite history among conversations with ASPECT_IRIEMON_ obtuse liberal friends , but not here . 
3648	1032	Also they do n't show a comparison with other candidates . 
3649	1032	That 's the REAL question . 
3650	1032	George W. Bush had about a 42 &#37; approval rating when BUSH was reelected in 2004 . 
3651	1032	Many times ... especially in times of war ... Americans will choose to keep the guy in charge in charge so as not to mix up war strategy . 
3652	1033	lol wut ? 
3653	1033	Republicans ran the house and senate for 6 years during Bush 's rein . 
3654	1033	ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ may not like that republicans are called conservatives but that 's what CONSERVATIVES are considered . 
3656	1033	If ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ want to change what that term means to Americans ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ can go ahead and try . 
3657	1033	But ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ have n't done TERM yet . 
3658	1033	Conservatives were in charge of the republican party and therefore CONSERVATIVES were in charge for 6 out of 8 years of Bush . 
3659	1033	Our economy started ECONOMY 's recession in 2007 . 
3660	1033	Democrats only gained `` control '' -LRB- if ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ want to call 49 repubs and 49 dems in the senate control -RRB- in 2007 . 
3661	1033	So democrats created a recession within a year of DEMOCRATS taking over congress ?! 
3662	1033	Man that takes skill ! 
3663	1033	Get real . 
3664	1033	Republicans\/conservatives caused this mess . 
3665	1033	And MESS 's the same ones now opposing Obama every move MAN makes . 
3666	1033	I think the fact that we are doing the opposite of what these guys want is a good thing . 
3667	1034	Label game playing . 
3668	1034	Bush ran as a conservative , was supported by conservatives , and followed conservative fiscal policies . 
3669	1034	Again , I appreciate ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ wanting to disown BUSH . 
3670	1034	Maybe we should trust ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ all this time ? 
3671	1034	There 's an old saying in Tennessee , I know TENNESSEE 's in Texas , probably in Tennessee , that says fool I once , shame on , shame on ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ . 
3672	1034	Fool I ... ca n't get fooled again . 
3673	1035	I do n't understand the reasoning . 
3674	1035	Liberals voted against Bush and BUSH policies not once . 
3675	1035	Not twice . 
3676	1035	But 3 times in the past decade . 
3677	1035	How could Bush possibly be a liberal . 
3678	1036	I think the logic goes ... Liberals are to blame for everything , so since the Bush administration was one of the worst in history , BUSH must be a liberal . 
3679	1036	That 's the only way I can figure WAY . 
3680	1037	Another dimwitted Obama supporter incapable of critical thought . 
3681	1037	If Republicans are all Conservatives in ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ small mind ... ... Are Democrats all Communists ???? 
3682	1037	thanks in advance 
3683	1038	She did !! 
3684	1038	SHE did n't say `` SHE can see russia from SHE house '' SHE said something along the lines of this interaction . 
3685	1038	Interviewer -LRB- who PALIN think was Charlie Gibson -RRB- : What do ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ say to people that say ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ do n't have enough experience or knowledge of foreign policy issues ? 
3686	1038	`` Palin : `` Well PALIN know there Charlie , INTERVIEWER have been governor of Alaska and PALIN can see Russia from Alaska . 
3687	1038	That gives INTERVIEWER foreign policy experience . 
3688	1038	`` That is a horrendously idiotic statement . 
3689	1038	ALASKA is just as stupid as saying PALIN can see Russia from PALIN house . 
3690	1038	ALASKA conveys the exact same message . 
3691	1038	SNL just added the house part for a bit of comedic effect . 
3692	1038	PALIN ca n't see the significant difference . 
3693	1038	Maybe ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ can explain to PALIN why it is ok to say ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ have foreign policy experience because ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ can see Russia from a part of ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ state ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ have never been to , but it is somehow silly to say the same thing about seeing THING from ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ house . 
3694	1038	RUSSIA is exactly the same , and if one is stupider , it is the one Palin said . 
3695	1038	At least if she could actually see Russia from SHE house , RUSSIA might be some form of strange logic . 
3696	1038	Instead SHE can not see Russia , has never seen Russia , and SHE claims that Russia 's proximity to Alaska somehow give SHE foreign policy experience just seem even stupider . 
3698	1039	And his poll numbers partly tanked because Conservatives became more and more angry with HIS policies . 
3699	1039	As for Label game playing , ASPECT_IRIEMON_ appear to be very good at PLAYING . 
3700	1040	lol huh ? 
3701	1040	THEY ALL CALL THEMSELVES CONSERVATIVE ! 
3703	1040	THEY 's not that hard to understand . 
3704	1040	George W. Bush is what the country thinks of when they think conservative policy . 
3705	1041	ThanksYet , a majority of Obama supporters believe she did . 
3706	1041	It isnt surprising Obama and OBAMA policies attract stupid people . 
3707	1042	There are plenty of stupid people on both sides . 
3708	1042	But if ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ want to play that game -LRB- which is a cheap one -RRB- I can show ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ plenty of polls that show educated people support Obama over Palin . 
3710	1043	Susan Collins calls herself a Conservative ? 
3711	1043	Scott Brown ? 
3712	1043	Olympia Snow ? 
3713	1043	John McKain -LRB- when SNOW isnt running for re-election -RRB- ? 
3714	1043	Arlen Specter -LRB- see McKain -RRB- ??? 
3715	1043	I can go on , but I can see ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ are not really interested in reality 
3717	1044	Look in a mirror . 
3718	1044	Most Obama boot lickers are , so ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ at least have company . 
3719	1045	Yes ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ are half way there . 
3720	1045	Reagan 's policies led to rapid private sector expansion , followed by rapid private sector collapse . 
3721	1045	So we can either follow Reagan 's model and get those years like 84-85 and have 5 % growth , which will then be followed by 10 % loss . 
3722	1045	Or WE can follow the post WWII Keynsian model that saw the longest period of uninterrupted global expansion in human history . 
3723	1045	Maybe WE never saw one or 2 years of massive growth , but WE never saw rapid declines either . 
3724	1045	If YEARS was n't for the massive deregulation campaign undertaken between 1981 and 2008 , WE would not be in the recession WE are now in . 
3725	1045	There can of course be over regulation , and if that occurs some deregulation makes sense . 
3726	1045	But the constant deregulation left the markets to their whims , and WE saw the outcomes that followed . 
3728	1046	They all call THEY conservatives . 
3730	1048	I 'll add ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ to the list of completely ignorant Obama supporters who post here . 
3731	1049	Since ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ are now resorting to insults I think it is safe to say we have maxed out ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ intellectual capacity . 
3732	1049	Thanks for playing . 
3734	1049	Have a balloon . 
3735	1050	good grief this is idiotic . 
3736	1050	Let me know how well all that regulation goes especially when the regulators are busy watching porn instead of doing REGULATORS jobsand the love affair JOBSAND boot lickers have with Keynes is quite interesting but ASPECT_FRODLY_ 've sort of been backed into a corner defending JOBSAND 
3737	1051	In what way was he a liberal ? 
3738	1051	What sort of revisionism is this ? 
3739	1051	Bush was a terrible president , so now we have right wing liars trying to say LIBERAL was liberal ?? 
3740	1051	I suppose there a few issues ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ could say LIBERAL was liberal about , immigration for example . 
3741	1051	But ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ could also spin that and say LIBERAL supported the free market , and supported the free movement of labor , so LIBERAL did n't want to intervene with the market . 
3742	1051	Which is what strict labor immigration control is . 
3743	1051	What else was Bush Liberal about ? 
3744	1051	LIBERAL spent a lot !! 
3745	1051	But that is a conservative trait in the modern world not a liberal one . 
3746	1051	The last 3 Republican president we had spent like lunatics . 
3747	1051	Reagan , Bush , and Bush . 
3748	1051	Clinton balanced the budget . 
3749	1051	No liberal would ever advocate for years of insane deficit spending , which is something only the right wing has ever done in this countries history other than the WWII era . 
3750	1051	What else could even remotely be twisted into a liberal stance ? 
3751	1051	Bush cut taxes . 
3753	1051	Opposed social freedoms . 
3754	1051	Opposed abortion . 
3755	1051	All those things are conservative . 
3756	1051	So ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ attempts to rewrite history might work among ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ braindead conservative hand puppets , but not among people with functioning brains . 
3757	1052	Good grief this is idiotic . 
3758	1052	This guy called some other post idiotic , and then GUY argument was `` this is idiotic '' followed by irrelevant nonsense and babbling . 
3759	1052	Hilarious when people makes the arguments of a child , and then insult others !! 
3760	1053	INSULT is not an insult if INSULT is true . 
3761	1053	Are ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ going to answer the question . 
3762	1053	Are all Democrats , communists ???? 
3763	1053	that is ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ logic . 
3764	1053	Or are ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ completely wrong suggesting Conservatives held power during the Bush Presidency ?? 
3765	1053	thanks in advance 
3766	1054	No they believed she said exactly what SHE actually said . 
3767	1054	Only right wing liars tried to distort the facts to change history . 
3768	1054	Sarah Palin did say the ability to see Alaska from SHE state was a foreign policy credential . 
3769	1054	Something that is undoubtedly stupid , and conveys the exact same message as `` PALIN can see russia from PALIN house '' even if the wording is different . 
3770	1054	The levels of dishonesty ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ are stooping to are really low . 
3771	1054	Try to raise ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ game , ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ are starting to bore me . 
3772	1055	So , we 've some to the point where supporting the Free Market now equals being a Conservativethe Party of JFK died a long time ago . 
3773	1055	How about the work he did with the drunk Ted Kennedy on education `` reform '' ?? 
3774	1055	The expansion of government creating the Department of Homeland security ??? 
3775	1055	HE spent like a drunken sailor - which is not conservative . 
3776	1056	Of course that was not the question asked . 
3777	1056	Did she say SHE could see COURSE from SHE House ? 
3778	1056	Obama supporters say ... ... . 
3780	1056	Of course . did . 
3781	1056	Its only boring ASPECT_FRODLY_ because ASPECT_FRODLY_ cant handle the facts . 
3782	1057	Yes it is . 
3783	1057	That is what modern conservatives do . 
3784	1057	Reagan spent more like a drunken sailor than Bush , and REAGAN actually increased the debt more than Bush comparable to the time periods -LRB- in other words Bush increased the debt more by a total number , but Reagan a greater percentage -RRB- . 
3785	1057	That education reform was not something any liberal would ever support , that is for sure . 
3786	1057	Nor is the oppressive actions taken to fight the war on terror . 
3787	1057	That is something moderates like Obama do , and conservatives like Bush do . 
3788	1057	Not actual liberals . 
3790	1058	Then ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ are pointing out irrelevancies . 
3791	1058	People were confused about the exact wordings of a Palin statement , and that is a sign of what ? 
3792	1058	ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ remember every word that Palin ever said as an exact quote ? 
3793	1058	Of course not . 
3794	1058	ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ remember the basic premise of the things she said . 
3795	1058	The basic premise of what SHE said was incredibly similar to `` SHE can see russia from SHE house '' PS . 
3796	1058	I am liberal and I know exactly what SHE said . 
3797	1058	So really , ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ point is without merit . 
3798	1058	The fact that people got confused about the wording of an answer sarah palin gave is irrelevant to anything I was actually talking about . 
3799	1059	educate ASPECT_FRODLY_ will yai even included a Washington Post link first , written in 2007 . 
3800	1059	that Bush was a Liberal Republican is not new news , however , considering how ASPECT_FRODLY_ must need REPUBLICAN to be a conservative , so ASPECT_FRODLY_ own ideology doesnt get too close to being something of the Soviet Union , or Venezuela 's - we can all understand how desperate ASPECT_FRODLY_ need the Bush \/ conservative myth to be believed . 
3801	1059	Not that 3 crummy links will change ASPECT_FRODLY_ mind , but heck Cohen and the Wash Post wrote about POST years agoBush the Neoliberalhttp : \/ \/ www.washingtonpost.com\/wp-dyn...052801053.htmlHow the Policies of the Bush Administration Are Liberal in Theoryhttp : \/ \/ www.associatedcontent.com\/art...a_liberal.htmlPresident Bush s Liberal Viewshttp : \/ \/ www.newdonkey.com\/president-b...ral-views.html 
3802	1060	I will accept this as an admission that Obama supporters are more likely to be guided by Saturday Night Live skit than reality . 
3803	1060	Or that Obama supporters were\/are gullible village idiots who actually believed Obama was going to lower taxes , that SUPPORTERS could keep SUPPORTERS health care , and so on and so onthe hard part for ASPECT_FRODLY_ is , the game is over and Independents -LRB- and hopefully some actual real Democrats -RRB- finally wised up 
3804	1062	Ah ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ mean the whole spreading democracy throughout the world . 
3805	1062	Well that was old school American liberalism for sure . 
3806	1062	The thing is though , that has been the policy of both Republican and Democratic presidents since the start of the cold war . 
3807	1062	Pre-WWII I would agree the conservative position tended to be isolationist and the liberal tended to have more expansive and optimistic foreign policy goals . 
3808	1062	That has n't been true very often since that point . 
3809	1062	And POINT absolutely has n't been true at least since the 70sI think ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ problem is , ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ seem to be confusing libertarianism with conservatism . 
3810	1062	Even that last link ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ gave said Bush was conservative , BUSH just believed in some liberal policies . 
3811	1062	The truth is BUSH is a Reagan style conservative . 
3812	1062	Insane spending . 
3813	1062	Belief in using foreign policy to promote and spread democracy . 
3815	1062	Tax cuts . 
3816	1062	That is Reagan 's playbook copied by GW Bush . 
3817	1062	Yet ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ seem to like Reagan and call Bush a liberal . 
3818	1062	When they have so many similarities that does n't make much sense . 
3819	1063	The hard part for ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ is I strongly oppose Obama 's presidency . 
3820	1063	I have n't defended Obama once , and if ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ look at I vote I said I would n't vote for Obama . 
3821	1063	So that is clearly not the explanation . 
3822	1064	LIBERTARIAN think ASPECT_FRODLY_ problem is projecting . 
3823	1064	LIBERTARIAN am a registered libertarian who voted for Michael Badnerik in 2004 , and wrote in Ron Paul in 2008 - and more often than not , voted Libertarians when given a choice . 
3824	1064	Although LIBERTARIAN will admit , LIBERTARIAN have never voted for the communist with the D by LIBERTARIANS name . 
3825	1064	LIBERTARIAN apologize for not coming into voting age when Democrats were still Democrats and not Marxists 
3826	1065	Then I apologize for projecting a bit myself 
3827	1066	The FACT that Bush was not Conservative , does NOT mean PRESIDENT was a liberal . 
3828	1066	PRESIDENT spent like one but did n't tax like one . 
3829	1066	Bush was a fiscally bad President . 
3830	1066	And probably best called a moderate Republican . 
3831	1066	True Conservatives and moderate to conservative Independents agree that Bush left much to be desired , especially in the spending area . 
3832	1066	What befuddles WORLD -LRB- among other things -RRB- is how liberals blame Bush for ALL including the excess spending , YET say obummer is doing GOOD by spending 3 times as much ????????? 
3833	1066	WORLD guess the liberal , dreamland , `` perfect world , '' mind has no need for logic . 
3834	1067	AgreedI missed where he credited Clinton with balancing the budget and completely ignored the Republican takeover in 94 and the Contract with Americawho believes , had that not happened , Clinton would have balanced the budget with a Democratic controlled House ? 
3835	1068	It was 1995 the Republicans took over . 
3836	1068	1995 is speculation as to what would have happened . 
3837	1068	But the Dems passed the 1993 tax increase that flooded the Treasury with revenues which gave us the surplus budget , and the deficit was falling rapidly in those two years before the Republicans got control . 
3838	1068	Furthermore , US saw once Bush got into office that the Republican congress was n't exactly thrifty when CONGRESS comes to spending . 
3839	1068	Year - `` on-budget '' deficit\/surplus1992 -340.41993 -300.4 -LRB- - Clinton takes office1994 -258.81995 -226.4 -LRB- - Republicans take control of Congress1996 -174.01997 -103.21998 -29.91999 1.9 Source : CBO . 
3840	1068	govThe deficits had already fallen 33 &#37; in the years before the Republicans took congress . 
3841	1069	And this is borderline delusional `` Right wing liars '' distort the facts and change history when attempting to correct what Saturday Night Live said versus Sara Palin ? 
3842	1069	THIS actually quite entertaining . 
3843	1070	Yes , but it is commonly referred to as the 1994 takeover which is when the election was . 
3844	1070	Remember IT , because we will be referring to Americans taking back the House this time around as the 2010 takeover 
3845	1071	Not in my experience . 
3846	1071	ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ 're not the first who incorrectly stated the Republicans took over in 1994 . 
3847	1071	And the Republicans will retain congress in 2002 and McCain will win the election in 2004 . 
3848	1071	Folks predict all kinds of things . 
3849	1072	Like Obama being a pragmatic centrist 
3850	1074	Fair enough , people can say that to refer to the election . 
3851	1074	I think we 've got the record straight PEOPLE did n't take actual control of Congress until 1995 , after the deficit had been declining rapidly for two years . 
3852	1075	The election was in 1994 but they did n't get into office until 1995 . 
3853	1075	Just like Bush had control of the white house when the 2009 deficit was predicted to be a staggering 1.2 trillion dollars even before we knew the full extent of the financial crash . 
3854	1077	What question and who are ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ addressing ? 
3856	1078	He 's asking ME if calling republicans conservative is the same as calling democrats communists . 
3858	1079	Libs do n't compare Obama to Bushed or the Puppet Master Dick . 
3859	1079	We realize that WE have something so much better . 
3860	1079	Get with the program . 
3861	1079	OBAMA has a lot more skills than that Bozo WE had before or McSame that was trying to take OBAMA place . 
3862	1079	I believe ASPECT_DAN40_ vision is blinded by ASPECT_DAN40_ ideology and ASPECT_DAN40_ are not able to see that . 
3863	1079	No , that Reps\/cons did n't want . 
3865	1079	That is what Boehner and the rest of the GOP who have REPS\/CONS head up so far into REPS\/CONS butts REPS\/CONS ca n't see that Wall Street is taking us to the cleaners , and does n't care because REPS\/CONS are in Wall Street 's pocket . 
3867	1079	That is why so many Rep Congressmen were so eager to take the money and take photo ops admitting MONEY was creating jobs . 
3868	1079	ASPECT_DAN40_ rhetoric reeks of right-wing anger , jealousy and erronious crap . 
3869	1079	The buffoon US had before made us the laughing stock of the world , thank God for an eloquent speaker US are no longer the butt of jokes . 
3870	1079	Some more Faux News type lies . 
3871	1079	Reps\/cons are so ignorant REPS\/CONS wanted Obama to plug the hole . 
3872	1079	Obama handled the crisis much more intelligently than dumb Bush handled Katrina . 
3873	1079	More lies . 
3874	1079	Post some facts if ASPECT_DAN40_ want to be credible instead of repeating the rethoric ASPECT_DAN40_ hear on Fixed Noise . 
3875	1079	Self-serving Reps\/cons would like the moratorium lifted , and if another spill occurs , they can whine and blame Obama for not taking action and declaring a moratorium . 
3876	1079	We 're talking about Bush\/Cheney , no ? 
3877	1079	I agree . 
3878	1079	It was the Justice Dept that did the suing , but ignorant cons do n't realize that . 
3879	1079	And , DOJ is just keeping with the Constitution , something that Reps\/cons do n't seem to understand . 
3880	1079	REPS\/CONS claim REPS\/CONS love the Constitution but do n't mind shredding CONSTITUTION or letting REPS\/CONS leaders -LRB- Bush\/Cheney -RRB- shred CONSTITUTION . 
3881	1079	Selfish reps do n't have any empathy for those that lost REPS jobs , REPS are just interested in helping BP and other corporations keep CORPORATIONS millions so CORPORATIONS can pay CORPORATIONS CEO 's big bonuses . 
3882	1079	And BP would all be considered BS . 
3883	1080	I agree with everything ASPECT_GOLDWATER_ said , except for Stormfront , and that is because I 've never been on that forum - probably would n't want to , we have enough inane posters on this forum . 
3884	1082	+1 spot on 
3885	1083	Oh , another complainer that does n't have any candidate they can claim can do better . 
3886	1083	We know how far Paul got ! 
3888	1083	And from ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ posts WE can easily conclude that ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ are an Obama hater with no facts other than Faux News type rhetoric being repeated by all the con sheeple . 
3889	1083	That 's what happens when peabrains try to understand\/explain issues beyond PEABRAINS comprehension . 
3890	1083	ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ predictions as well as ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ assumptions can all be classified as a bunch of BS . 
3891	1083	The mistakes were already made by the previous administration , may PEABRAINS never , ever , be in charge again ! 
3892	1084	closeI asked if ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ were ready to admit ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ were wrong . 
3893	1084	Not in ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ lifetime has the government been controlled by Conservatives . 
3894	1085	I 'll add ASPECT_MERTEX_ to the list too . 
3895	1086	all too easy 
3896	1087	Actually , according to Quinnipiac , a fictitious letter R currently does better according to Americathats how badly DOINGWHAT is doingwhat a fall from `` grace `` http:\/\/www.google.com\/#hl=en&amp;source=...fb550a2476ba2a 
3897	1090	Ask ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ if ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ give a -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- about ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- ing list ! 
3898	1091	ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ link is faulty , sort of like ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ posts . 
3899	1092	I take that as a yes . 
3900	1092	OK Bolsheivik . 
3901	1092	Enjoy ASPECT_MERTEX_ dictatorship !! 
3902	1093	In a dictatorship , there is one party-rule by force , not by choice . 
3903	1093	Therefore PARTY-RULE find ASPECT_BASSMAN_ little retort laughable and ignorant . 
3905	1094	Mertex said they do n't deserve power , what the hell relevance does that have to Bolshevism ? 
3906	1094	Did Mertex say the party should sieze control and stop Republicans from taking control ? 
3907	1094	Certainly not . 
3908	1094	But anyone who was even semi-conscious between 2001 and 2009 must understand how disastrous Republican control is . 
3909	1094	Maybe one day people , when PEOPLE realize Democrats suck , will not then turn to Republicans only to realize PEOPLE also suck , just to turn back to Democrats . 
3910	1094	Maybe one day people will wake up and break that cycle . 
3911	1094	There is no doubt that Republicans do not deserve power with PEOPLE record though . 
3912	1094	I would rather give power to Lindsay Lohan after a week long coke binge . 
3913	1095	lol one more conservative using words they do n't understand . 
3914	1095	Maybe THEY should pay more attention to dem dar fancy book readin types . 
3915	1096	YOURSELF appear to be guilty of that ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ . 
3916	1096	Suggesting Olympia Snowe , Susan Collins , Arlen Specter and John McKain are self appointed conservatives is certainly using words ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ simply do not understand . 
3917	1097	yes , but as in the other thread , Can a real named republican beat YES . 
3919	1097	i just dont see . with the way the republican party has been going ... Get as center as possible -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- POSSIBLE ... forget about ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ all mighty social high horse that scares away voters but keep the conservative spending . 
3920	1098	Conservatism in it 's basic definition is a political ideology that is against new programs . 
3921	1098	Everyone in the republican party is in general against new government programs . 
3922	1098	Therefore they all fit under the conservative ideology . 
3923	1098	There are multiple subfactions of conservatism . 
3924	1098	Including libertarians . 
3925	1098	But the neo cons of the republican party are no less conservative than the libertarians . 
3926	1098	I am not wrong . 
3927	1098	I just do n't have a political agenda to redefine conservativism to separate REPUBLICAN from the neo cons and George W. Bush . 
3928	1099	For the sake of argument I will not correct ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ flawed definition and statements but accept them to make a point . 
3929	1099	Following ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ own logic , and absolute unwillingness to admit ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ are wrong , then all Democrats are Communists . 
3930	1099	It is n't much of a secret that COMMUNISTS are , but I 'd really like to see ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ type SECRET , or agree with TYPE . 
3931	1099	Then again , reading ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ attempt to squirm ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ way around this , is sufficiently entertaining . 
3932	1100	No because the basic defintion of communism is a desire for the state to take complete control of all businesses . 
3933	1100	Not a single democrat has proposed any such thing . 
3934	1100	ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ are truly doing a poor job displaying ASPECT_HISTORICUS_ knowledge of political ideologies and their definitions . 
3935	1101	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ should n't be so quick to criticize skippyAfter all , the argument ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ are feebly attempting to make is that all Republicans are Conservatives . 
3936	1101	I 'll leave SKIPPYAFTER up to the objective readers out there in internet land to decide which of the two of us is doing a poor job at displaying knowledge . 
3938	1104	lol \*\*\* MOD EDIT - personal attack deleted \*\*\*\* This is not at all a scientific test . 
3939	1104	Especially since EDIT does n't have another candidate to compare to . 
3940	1104	Many would n't want to vote for Obama but hate Sarah Palin even more so MANY vote for Obama to keep her out . 
3941	1105	also there needs to be a maybe option , then again id hope most everyone would select maybe . 
3942	1105	I would n't make up ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ mind too early and without proper research first . 
3943	1107	When we are dealing with posters -LRB- and sadly voters -RRB- like Tao who actually believes Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins are conservatives , how can ASPECT_DAN40_ expect POSTERS to grasp even the simplest of reasons why Obama 's numbers are tanking ? 
3945	1108	That ASPECT_4HORSEMEN_ are comparing the country to a right-leaning forum 's poll just shows how lacking in knowledge and logic some people are . 
3946	1108	The fact that there are that many in favor in a clearly right-wing Forum is cause for alarm for the right , I would say . 
3947	1108	Clear thinking ? 
3948	1108	I think not , more delusional . 
3949	1109	LOL ASPECT_4HORSEMEN_ figure this board is representative of clear thinking Americans ? 
3950	1109	ASPECT_4HORSEMEN_ have n't read many posts . 
3951	1109	Well , maybe on second thought , ASPECT_4HORSEMEN_ have . 
3952	1110	Thanks a lot ! 
3954	1111	Clearly EXPERT are an expert in the field of being delusional . 
3955	1111	I posted this : `` AS of TODAY ! 
3956	1111	Overall , 44 % of VOTERS say VOTERS at least somewhat approve of the president 's performance . 
3957	1111	Fifty-six percent -LRB- 56 % -RRB- disapprove .25 % of VOTERS , Strongly approve -LRB- liberals & parasites , mostly parasites -RRB- of the way B.O. is preforming as President . 
3958	1111	While 45 % of VOTERS STRONGLY DISAPPROVE of the job B.O. is doing . 
3959	1111	More REAL numbers the dreaming libs . 
3960	1111	wo n't like . 
3961	1111	`` EVERY , not some or one or two , EVERY neutral polling company has similar results . 
3962	1111	ASPECT_MERTEX_ can laughingly post a radical liberal polling company but COMPANY will be meaningless . 
3963	1111	NEUTRAL polling companies ALL have B.O. going down the tubes . 
3964	1111	To ANY Republican and even to some Democrats . 
3965	1111	That is how bad B.O. 's star has fallen . 
3966	1111	Some Democrats and even some liberal Democrats are looking at the idea of dumping REPUBLICAN . 
3967	1111	Radical RIGHT wing pollsters do n't show B.O. 's numbers to be a lot worse than the neutral companies , POLLSTERS do n't have to . 
3968	1111	B.O. the incompetent , radical Socialist CLOWN , further destroys B.O. with each passing day , gaff , screw-up , and lie . 
3969	1112	ASPECT_MERTEX_ liberals are always delusional p u s s i e s. Please read belowGee can someone tell I if LIBERALS think the democrats might do the same thing !!!!! 
3970	1112	duhhh ... . 
3971	1112	If a Republican does n't like guns , REPUBLICAN doesn t buy one . 
3972	1112	If a Democrat does n't like guns , DEMOCRAT wants all guns outlawed . 
3973	1112	If a Republican is a vegetarian , REPUBLICAN doesn t eat meat . 
3974	1112	If a Democrat is a vegetarian , DEMOCRAT wants all meat products banned for everyone . 
3975	1112	If a Republican is homosexual , REPUBLICAN quietly leads REPUBLICAN life . 
3976	1112	If a Democrat is homosexual , DEMOCRAT demands legislated respect . 
3977	1112	If a Republican is down-and-out , REPUBLICAN thinks about how to better REPUBLICAN situation . 
3978	1112	A Democrat wonders who is going to take care of DEMOCRAT . 
3979	1112	If a Republican does n't like a talk show host , REPUBLICAN switches channels . 
3980	1112	Democrats demand that those DEMOCRATS do n't like be shut down . 
3981	1112	If a Republican is a non-believer , REPUBLICAN does n't go to church . 
3982	1112	A Democrat non-believer wants any mention of God and religion silenced . 
3983	1112	If a Republican decides REPUBLICAN needs health care , REPUBLICAN goes about shopping for CARE , or may choose a job that provides CARE . 
3984	1112	A Democrat demands that the rest of us pay for DEMOCRAT . 
3985	1112	If a Republican reads this , REPUBLICAN 'll forward THIS so REPUBLICAN friends can have a good laugh . 
3986	1112	A Democrat will delete THIS because DEMOCRAT 's `` offended '' . 
3987	1112	Ca n't wait for Obama prick to get the h3ll out of office . 
3988	1112	Worse than bush . 
3989	1114	only obama voters are allowed to be on the friend list , ASPECT_HILLBILLY_ are one of uskeep up the good fight 
3990	1115	el oh elthe numbers are not that far off from polls even democrats are conductingel oh elCNN , Quinnipiac , USA Today , James Carvilleonly around 40 % currently think the Charlatan deserves to be re-elected . 
3991	1115	STATEMENT 's a sad statement on the inability of critical thought of roughly 40 % of AmericansCarville 's poll is the most entertaining as a majority of Americans now agree that Socialist is an accurate description of dear leaderGoogleel oh el 
3992	1116	The economy may eventually turn around , in spite of Obama . 
3993	1116	So , basing ASPECT_HILLBILLY_ vote for Obama on the economy may be unfounded and without merit . 
3994	1117	lol wow ... 
3995	1118	Good point . 
3996	1118	I 'm sure a poll here at PF scientifically represents the opinions of the American people . 
3998	1119	There is not a single poll anywhere at any point in time that said Obama stands to lose 2 to 1 to any republican . 
3999	1119	Even generic nameless republicans . 
4000	1121	Try paying attention to the amount of people who think they will vote for HIM , which is what the poll in the thread asks . 
4001	1121	roughly 40 % according to the ones I referenced . 
4003	1121	I know how much ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ dislike AMOUNT . 
4004	1122	el oh elThats the best ASPECT_IRIEMON_ could do ? 
4005	1122	The thread poll , is not that far off from others . 
4006	1122	See above post . 
4007	1122	Deal with POLL . 
4008	1123	Deal with it ? 
4009	1123	LOL Pass . 
4010	1123	I do n't need to deal with irrelevant nonsense . 
4011	1123	But feel free to show us the polls that show only 34 &#37; would vote for Obama in the next election . 
4012	1124	FYI , I was n't responding to ASPECT_DAN40_ post , but to 4Horse - and yes , it is delusional because everyone knows this Forum leans way right ! 
4013	1124	So what , those polls go up and down depending on what the President did the day before , whether YES liked BEFORE or not . 
4014	1124	The real proof will be in 2012 . 
4015	1124	Most Libs\/Dems are too smart to put that much stock into LIBS\/DEMS , but go ahead and let LIBS\/DEMS make ASPECT_DAN40_ day . 
4016	1124	ASPECT_DAN40_ will need all those happy days to remember , when Nov 2012 comes along . 
4017	1124	Well , DAYS appears from ASPECT_DAN40_ radical ranting that ASPECT_DAN40_ either are very immature or a right-winger that has n't been around long enough to know that these polls do n't mean a whole lot . 
4018	1124	Some that may show displeasure now , would rather have a President SOME are familiar with and that has done some good rather than a newcomer that who knows where SOME will lead us , especially if SOME are Republican and believe the same nonsense that got US in the mess US are . 
4019	1126	Thank ASPECT_MERTEX_ , Thank ASPECT_MERTEX_ , I now understand that the mature way to act when ALL polls are against ASPECT_MERTEX_ ideas , is to then discount the very idea of polling in the first place . 
4020	1126	Thank ASPECT_MERTEX_ for ASPECT_MERTEX_ `` insight '' into maturity . 
4021	1127	I 'm sure ASPECT_DAN40_ will understand when ASPECT_DAN40_ get older - like in Nov 2012 . 
4022	1128	November 2012 ? 
4023	1128	ASPECT_MERTEX_ mean when we get rid of the incompetent lying clown in the White House ? 
4024	1128	That November 2012 ? 
4025	1128	One of us WILL learn a lesson and ONE wo n't be this senior citizen , sonny ! 
4026	1130	That might be erroneous , but how is erroneously calling someone else a racist , racist ? 
4027	1130	How is that a negative or prejudical statement based on race ? 
4028	1131	If ASPECT_IRIEMON_ would restate that in English , I may answer it . 
4029	1132	He said : How is falsely calling someone a racist an example of someone thinking a certain race is superior or saying something negative or prejudiced on the basis of race -LRB- the definition of racism -RRB- . 
4030	1132	The words in HE post were n't THAT big . 
4031	1132	Try to keep up . 
4032	1132	At least look up words ASPECT_DAN40_ do n't understand . 
4033	1133	Let me know if ASPECT_DAN40_ still ca n't understand it after Bill 's comment . 
4034	1135	If true , that would be `` moronic . '' 
4035	1135	THAT would not make them `` racist . '' 
4036	1135	I 'm not entirely sure ASPECT_DAN40_ know what the term means . 
4038	1136	I understood ASPECT_DAN40_ assertion perfectly the first time . 
4039	1136	Let I make I position a bit simpler , if I can . 
4040	1136	A `` racist , '' by definition , is one who discriminates or is prejudiced against others or villifies OTHERS based on OTHERS race . 
4041	1136	Now , if a liberal -LRB- or anyone else -RRB- calls someone a `` racist '' based not on the person 's race , but on OTHERS own inability to conduct and intelligent argument , then the liberal is not discriminating or being prejudiced against that person based on race , but based on ignorance , right ? 
4042	1136	So by definition , that does not indicate OTHERS are racist at all , does DEFINITION ? 
4043	1136	Now , what were WHAT saying about being able to conduct an intelligent argument ? 
4044	1136	In the meantime , the rest of us will just savor the delicious irony of ASPECT_DAN40_ calling liberals the most racist for calling others racists when being unable to conduct an intelligent argument . 
4045	1137	As a liberal , ASPECT_IRIEMON_ naturally want to define racist in the narrowest terms possible . 
4046	1137	However , in reality , -LRB- a term foreign to liberals -RRB- playing the race card against all and any at every opportunity is RACIST , whether ASPECT_IRIEMON_ wish to acknowledge that or not . 
4047	1137	IE calling the AZ law RACIST when REALITY is not , IS RACIST . 
4048	1138	A wise man once said : `` Racism is simply an ugly form of collectivism , the mindset that views humans only as members of groups and never as individuals . 
4049	1138	Racists believe that all individual who share superficial physical characteristics are alike ; as collectivists , racists think only in terms of groups . 
4050	1138	By encouraging Americans to adopt a group mentality , the advocates of so-called `` diversity '' actually perpetuate racism . 
4051	1138	ADVOCATES intense focus on race is inherently racist , because FOCUS views individuals only as members of racial groups . 
4052	1138	Conservatives and libertarians should fight back and challenge the myth that collectivist liberals care more about racism . 
4053	1138	Modern liberalism , however well intentioned , is a byproduct of the same collectivist thinking that characterizes racism . 
4054	1138	The continued insistence on group thinking only inflames racial tensions . '' 
4055	1138	- Ron paulYou can read the whole of the statement here : http:\/\/www.lewrockwell.com\/paul\/paul68.htmlAlso a very interesting video involving tea parties and racism is here : YouTube - Who 's Racist ? 
4056	1139	Why is that natural for a liberal ? 
4059	1139	Well I suppose if ASPECT_DAN40_ want to make up definitions LOL can be anything ASPECT_DAN40_ want LOL . 
4060	1139	In the meantime , the rest of us will just savor the delicious irony of ASPECT_DAN40_ talking about how `` reality '' is a foreign term to liberals while ASPECT_DAN40_ make up definitions not found in any `` reality '' based dictionary or definition . 
4061	1140	How the hell are conservatives going to fight about HELL when CONSERVATIVES do n't even know what `` racist '' means . 
4062	1140	Here we have Dan40 whose thinks the word `` racist '' has absolutely nothing to do with anything about race , prejudice , or discrimination . 
4063	1141	So since ASPECT_DAN40_ are calling liberals racists thereby playing the race card , exactly what ASPECT_DAN40_ accuse liberals of doing , does not that make ASPECT_DAN40_ a racist too by ASPECT_DAN40_ own definition ? 
4064	1142	I 'm talking the traditional concervative , who is really more a libertarian in todays terms . 
4065	1142	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ are thinking of what some might call a Neo-concervative . 
4066	1142	SOME are going to fight NEO-CONCERVATIVE , hopefully by reading that paper I gave a link to , educating SOME , and speaking some sense . 
4067	1142	That ought to be the strategy for every political and ethical individual that hopes to eliminate such unfounded inequality . 
4068	1142	That may just be I opinion . 
4069	1142	Also I will say in regard to Dan40 , that calling a law racist , does n't make someone racist , DAN40 makes SOME ignorant of what racist means . 
4070	1142	A document can not be racist . 
4071	1142	DOCUMENT can be written by a racist , and DOCUMENT can defend racist actions , but the document DOCUMENT can not be racist . 
4072	1142	Personally I do n't like the Arizona law , as big a states rights guy as I am , the constitution gives the power to regulate national borders to the Federal Government . 
4073	1142	If the states want to devote resources to help in that endeavor that is their right , but to make laws in that respect appears to be unconstitutional . 
4074	1142	I 'll have to look into ENDEAVOR a bit more though . 
4075	1142	If arizona wants to pass such a law , then we need a 28th amendment . 
4076	1143	The race card is a liberal weapon to be used against any that disagree with their silly Utopian dreams . 
4077	1143	And using WEAPON against all who disagree is a slur against all people of color , so YES , calling people racist when PEOPLE are not , is an insult , and therefore RACIST . 
4078	1144	Oh so now any insult is racist ? 
4080	1145	Typical liberal nonsense , ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ bend words to fit ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ purpose and use the bent words as weapons . 
4081	1145	But when turned against ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ , suddenly ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ demand the strictest Library of Congress definition of a word . 
4082	1145	OPPORTUNISTS 're not only racist opportunists , ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ are bullsh ! 
4083	1145	t racist opportunists . 
4084	1146	I 'm supposed to believe a person too lazy to give I a link ? 
4085	1146	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ vote that I 'm laughably wrong is the best ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ 've got ? 
4086	1146	I mother-in-law could hit harder ! 
4087	1146	There is another way ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ could prove I 'm wrong . 
4088	1146	Tell I how government knows I 'm looking for a job if they stop asking the question after I unemployment compensation has ended ? 
4089	1146	We should suppose government is psychic ? 
4090	1146	Actually that explains a lot ... 
4091	1147	I think most all factions are guilty of this from time to time . 
4092	1147	I think MECHANISM is a natural defense mechanism more often than MECHANISM is a tactical plan . 
4093	1147	Hardly a Liberal only endeavor . 
4094	1148	Every few years or so , that agency changes its formula to make the numbers look a little sweeter . 
4095	1148	They also neglect to revaluate previous satistics , but post SATISTICS together all the same . 
4096	1148	Here is an elementary example : before -- there were 7 yellow people and 3 green ppl unemployed equaling 10 &#37; of the populationnow -- there are 10 yellow people and 10 green ppl equaling 20 % of the populationBefore for instance , PEOPLE counted yellow and greens in unemployment . 
4097	1148	So in this mock example 10 % of people are unemployed . 
4098	1148	Now PEOPLE stoped counting green people . 
4099	1148	so NOW looks like only 10 % unemployment . 
4100	1148	Therefore as far as we know , there has been little change . 
4101	1148	In real terms the government says WE have 10 % unemployment and 2 % inflation . 
4102	1148	In terms WE used from the very beginning -LRB- before -RRB- or unmanipulated ... WE actually have 22 % unemployment and 6 % inflation ... So yes , the Bureau of labor satistics is kind of bull . 
4103	1149	Sorry , but it is always the liberals that use the word racist as a weapon against any that disagree with them . 
4104	1149	Other words could apply equally to all groups , but liberals have cornered the market on using the word , racist , as a put down for all dissent . 
4105	1150	How is using the word racist a slur against all people of color ? 
4106	1150	So when ASPECT_DAN40_ call liberals racists are ASPECT_DAN40_ slurring all people of color ? 
4107	1150	Are ASPECT_DAN40_ a racist ? 
4108	1151	ASPECT_DAN40_ 've being using the word racist as a weapon for the past 5 pages ! 
4109	1151	When did ASPECT_DAN40_ start calling ASPECT_DAN40_ a liberal ? 
4110	1152	That is not true at all . 
4111	1152	The work force consists of those who are working , or want to . 
4112	1153	What is the source for these assertions ? 
4113	1153	While the BLS has improved BLS polling methodology , the measure of the standard unemployment rate -LRB- now called U-3 -RRB- has remained essentially unchanged for decades . 
4114	1155	I guess the pain of reality is why ASPECT_IRIEMON_ avoid PAIN at all costs . 
4115	1155	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ can call I racist if ASPECT_IRIEMON_ wish , ASPECT_IRIEMON_ opinion is nothing to I , and ASPECT_IRIEMON_ can brand I with the nonsensical liberal brand too . 
4116	1155	Again , I do not care what ASPECT_IRIEMON_ opinions are since ASPECT_IRIEMON_ liberal opinions are silly , unworkable , illogical , and are constantly changed while denying the last failed idea ever existed . 
4117	1155	So say what ASPECT_IRIEMON_ want , LAST meaningless . 
4118	1156	ASPECT_DAN40_ 've been hanged on by ASPECT_DAN40_ own words , not mine . 
4119	1157	Hanged by less than a wisp of smoke , not hardly . 
4120	1158	Others can decide that for OTHERS . 
4121	1161	Sure thing dad . 
4122	1162	WOW , ASPECT_IRIEMON_ have a big family ! 
4123	1164	I like ASPECT_SURVEYBOB_ signature . 
4124	1164	I slogan for the November elections : IF ASPECT_SURVEYBOB_ 'RE IN -------- ASPECT_SURVEYBOB_ 'RE OUT 
4125	1165	From my own personal experience -LRB- family members and friends that are Republican -RRB- , there are a lot of Republicans that are racist . 
4126	1165	MEMBERS insult blacks , hispanics and other minorities for no reason and generalize negatively about MEMBERS . 
4127	1165	ASPECT_DAN40_ have many of those kind of people in ASPECT_DAN40_ Tea Parties whether ASPECT_DAN40_ want to admit KIND or not . 
4128	1165	Maybe some Libs use the race card as a weapon , but hey , when CARD 's out there in ASPECT_DAN40_ face -LRB- racist signs at Tea Parties and negative comments made public -RRB- CARD is quite obvious , and CARD will be acknowledged . 
4129	1166	If ASPECT_NATURALIST_ compensation has ended , why would the government care if ASPECT_NATURALIST_ are still looking or not ? 
4130	1166	ASPECT_NATURALIST_ would be the one that would be suffering , ergo , ONE would be up to ASPECT_NATURALIST_ to do something about ONE . 
4131	1167	And mostly Republicans\/conservatives actually act racist . 
4132	1167	If ASPECT_DAN40_ do n't like the word racist , do n't be one . 
4133	1167	Do n't generalize about minorities , do n't insult without cause , do n't be afraid MINORITIES are going to take ASPECT_DAN40_ job , do n't be afraid MINORITIES are going to take over the country and make ASPECT_DAN40_ a slave . 
4134	1167	Watch this : YouTube - Misconceptions of Obama fuel Republican ... 
4135	1168	Once again a liberal uses the race card as a weapon . 
4136	1168	And tries to tell REPUBLICAN how to act and how to conduct REPUBLICAN life . 
4137	1168	Well REPUBLICAN am not afraid of ANYONE taking REPUBLICAN job because REPUBLICAN 'm retired . 
4138	1168	And REPUBLICAN did not worry about anyone taking REPUBLICAN job before REPUBLICAN retired because no one did ONE as well . 
4139	1168	Some tried . 
4140	1168	And before REPUBLICAN 'm made into a slave REPUBLICAN 'll be a cadaver . 
4141	1168	And REPUBLICAN 'd hope to take a bunch with REPUBLICAN . 
4142	1168	And REPUBLICAN 'm NOT a Republican . 
4143	1168	REPUBLICAN 'm for replacing incumbents of both parties and instituting strict term limits for the replacements . 
4144	1168	REPUBLICAN find Democrats to be only marginally worse than Republicans . 
4145	1168	And liberals are simply insane and out of touch with reality . 
4146	1169	Sly ; speaking of '' nutz '' that `` BIMBO '' has bigger BALLS than any politician out there and BIMBO for one think we need some BALLS in the white house . 
4147	1172	Arguments are over facts . 
4148	1172	Opinions are for voting . 
4149	1172	LIBERAL 'm for individual Freedoms and Liberties . 
4150	1172	Why then do LIBERAL like Obama ? 
4151	1172	LIBERAL 'm a Liberal . 
4152	1172	Why then do LIBERAL dislike the Democratic party ? 
4153	1172	Be careful with the generalizations . 
4154	1174	Are ASPECT_NATURALIST_ kidding me ? 
4155	1174	If ASPECT_NATURALIST_ are for individual freedoms and liberties ASPECT_NATURALIST_ can not support Obama ! 
4156	1174	Thats an oxymoron . 
4157	1174	YOURSELF are lieing to ASPECT_NATURALIST_ ME friend . 
4159	1174	Stimulus , Goverenment pumping money into social programs for the purpose of control .2 . 
4160	1174	Universal health care .3 . 
4161	1174	Cap and Trade .4 . 
4162	1174	Raising capital gain tax .5 . 
4163	1174	Tarp , structured to take control of the financial sector .6 . 
4164	1174	Global warming , A smoke screen to initiate environmental restrictions designed to collapse the free enterprise .7 . 
4165	1174	Big government , because the collective knows better than the individual . 
4166	1174	The list goes on and on all the above is stucturaly engineered to take our individual freedoms away from OUR and to essort in a secular elite progressive Government . 
4167	1174	OUR will be like little worker bees and OUR job will be to bring honey back to the collective hive . 
4168	1174	Give ME Liberty or give ME death !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
4169	1176	I gave ASPECT_NATURALIST_ a link to the BLS . 
4170	1176	ASPECT_NATURALIST_ wrote LINK off as BS . 
4171	1176	ASPECT_NATURALIST_ wrote out the institution that is responsible for counting unemployment as BS . 
4172	1176	I do n't understand how anyone interested in politics could be so bullheaded and willfully ignorant . 
4173	1176	Do some -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- ing research and ASPECT_NATURALIST_ wo n't look so dumb ! 
4174	1176	INSTITUTION 's hilarious that ASPECT_NATURALIST_ call I too lazy when I already provided ASPECT_NATURALIST_ with the link to answer ASPECT_NATURALIST_ questions and ASPECT_NATURALIST_ very clearly have not read SOME . 
4175	1176	Here is the answers : http:\/\/www.bls.gov\/cps\/cps_htgm.htm#where 
4176	1177	And the result of all that expensive BLS effort is that if a person 's benefits have expired and they have given up trying to find a job . 
4177	1177	According to the BLS THEY are NO LONGER UNEMPLOYED . 
4178	1177	The unemployment rate dropped from 9.7 to 9.5 a couple of months ago , NOT because people had found work , but because the BLS SAID 652,000 , formerly unemployed , PEOPLE HAD , `` LEFT THE LABOR FORCE ! 
4179	1177	`` PEOPLE choose to believe the Democrat\/liberal Pols and disbelieve the Republican\/conservative Pols . 
4180	1177	The operative word is UNEMPLOYED are Pols. , UNEMPLOYED both LIE !!!! 
4181	1177	We NEED part-time , non-career legislators , not power mad politicians . 
4182	1177	Do WE need ranting idiots like Grayson using POLS. franking privilege to spend $ 75,000,000.00 to mail out re-election CD 's on WE Dollar . 
4183	1177	Not on GRAYSON campaign money , WE tax money . 
4184	1178	What we need is to get the lawyers out of govt altogether . 
4187	1179	People who lose unemployment benefits are STILL counted as unemployed so long as PEOPLE are still looking for work . 
4188	1179	How many times do I have to say NO ? 
4189	1179	ASPECT_DAN40_ quoted the link that proves ASPECT_DAN40_ wrong . 
4190	1179	Seriously ... SOURCE takes the motion of one index finger and a little reading time to learn and ASPECT_DAN40_ still refuse to do so ! 
4191	1179	I posted the link . 
4192	1179	I was told SOURCE was a BS source . 
4193	1179	I reiterated the link can not be a BS source because the source is straight from the horse 's mouth . 
4194	1179	The BLS is responsible for counting unemployment . 
4195	1179	I was still told I was wrong . 
4196	1179	So I posted the link again and copyed and pasted the exact section that proves I right . 
4197	1179	Since ASPECT_DAN40_ STILL can not read after going to the EXACT section SECTION proves I right I will now copy and past the EXACT PARAGRAPH that proves I right . 
4198	1179	If ASPECT_DAN40_ ca n't even read a paragraph then ASPECT_DAN40_ really do n't belong on this forum . 
4200	1180	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ just posted a link about Obama 's birth certificate that I proved was BS ... double standards ? 
4201	1181	Great point , I have a trading Acc . 
4202	1181	I wish I had a 25 % gain in that ! 
4203	1182	Then what is motivating ASPECT_DAN40_ to be racist ? 
4204	1182	Oh , that 's right , ASPECT_DAN40_ are n't , ASPECT_DAN40_ just sound racist . 
4206	1182	Some conservatives are racist , even though CONSERVATIVES do n't claim to be Republican . 
4207	1182	Like Ron Paul , PAUL claims to be Independent , but runs on the Republican ticket ? 
4208	1182	INDEPENDENT would be nice to replace incumbents from both parties with impartial , unbiased , non-racist incumbents , but soon ASPECT_DAN40_ find that even the ones calling INCUMBENTS Independents have ONES own special warts . 
4209	1182	And extremes on both sides are insane and out of touch with reality , but recently the Republican party has grown a whole slew of INCUMBENTS , INCUMBENTS call INCUMBENTS `` Tea Party '' ! 
4210	1183	Birthers will never accept Obama 's birth certificate , no matter how official and authentic CERTIFICATE is . 
4211	1183	That 's ASPECT_JTHORP24_ problem not Obama 's . 
4212	1184	Seems to me Reps flip-flop on what they want . 
4213	1184	Not to long ago Palin and McCain were both for cap and trade , now THEY are against CAP ! 
4214	1184	Is that the same with ASPECT_CAPITALIST_PIG_ ? 
4215	1184	If McCain had won , ASPECT_CAPITALIST_PIG_ 'd be all for SAME , right ? 
4216	1184	Sarah Palin 's Flip-Flop on Cap-and-TradePOSTED BY CLOE ON JULY 20 , 2009 AT 08:01 PMSince Sarah Palin announced that she d be resigning SHE post as Alaska s governor -LRB- 16 month early -RRB- a couple of weeks ago , ON s made FLIP-FLOP clear that ON plans to spend more time traveling around the lower 48 states . 
4217	1184	True to task , on Tuesday Palin had an oped in the Washington Post articulating AN opposition to President Obama s energy plan which includes a cap-and-trade program that would allow industrial sources to buy and sell pollution permits . 
4218	1184	But TUESDAY looks like AN s a little unclear on what AN policy positions are . 
4219	1184	During the campaign , McCain-Palin campaign literature -LRB- check CAMPAIGN out below -RRB- and the candidate AN -LRB- see the video -RRB- sang a totally different tune . 
4220	1184	THEN : They -LRB- McCain-Palin -RRB- have proposed a cap-and-trade system that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions while encouraging the development of low-cost compliance options . 
4221	1184	A climate cap-and-trade mechanism would set a limit on greenhouse gas emissions and allow entities to buy and sell rights to emit , similar to the successful acid rain trading program of the early 1990s . 
4222	1184	The key feature of this mechanism is that FEATURE allows the market to decide and encourage the lowest-cost compliance options . 
4223	1184	NOW : Palin wants to responsibly tap the resources that God created right underfoot on American soil and drill in the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge . 
4225	1185	Double standards ? 
4226	1185	Every birther arguement has been proven beyond a doubt to be false . 
4227	1185	No court in this country has even accepted a birther case because they are so mind numbingly void of evidence . 
4228	1186	What ASPECT_MERTEX_ liberals interpret as `` extremes '' are everyone that does not share ASPECT_MERTEX_ beautiful and fine sounding but impossible Utopian dreams . 
4229	1186	`` Everything for Everybody , '' would be the end result for all liberals . 
4230	1186	Well certainly RESULT would be wonderful if everyone was free from want and need and WORK . 
4231	1186	But that is not only impossible , RESULT is impossible in the `` extreme . 
4232	1186	`` And the Tea Party IS the American Silent Majority finding RESULT voice . 
4234	1186	ca n't understand that and reject that simple TRUTH . 
4235	1186	IS the ` tea party ' a mixed bag ? 
4236	1186	Certainly AMERICA is , AMERICA AMERICA . 
4237	1186	Standing up for actual VALUES instead of ` dreaming impossible dreams . 
4238	1186	`` Should libs FEAR the Silent Majority ? 
4239	1186	Oh very YES . 
4240	1186	Not for violence , but because YES means the end of liberalism and progressiveness . 
4241	1186	And will re-establish the idea of rewards for hard work and accomplishment instead of rewarding mediocrity and abject whining . 
4242	1186	Out of touch with reality ? 
4243	1186	Missouri voted 71 &#37; against obummercare . 
4244	1186	Gibbs said , to paraphrase , `` doan mean nuttin . '' 
4245	1186	That was what was said in Vietnam to avoid reality . 
4246	1186	Reid said . 
4247	1186	The more people learn about the health care bill , the better PEOPLE like BILL . 
4248	1186	That is BOTH untrue and out of touch with reality . 
4249	1186	So Gibbs and Reid are both out of touch with reality or both intentional liars . 
4250	1186	And most likely BOTH are Both . 
4251	1186	And Gallup , not FOX , not Rasmussen , now has obummer 's approval at 41 % for vs 57 % AGAINST . 
4252	1186	2 more points on BO 's consistent and constant downward spiral and we break into the 30 's . 
4253	1186	Wonder how many Dems will ask for BO campaign help when BO 's in the 30 's ?? 
4254	1186	They 'll be `` BUSY , '' when BO comes to town . 
4255	1186	A $ 6.00 a plate fund raiser at Burger King is not far off . 
4256	1187	ASPECT_MERTEX_ find a self serving piece on the DEMOCRATS.ORG . 
4258	1187	How much credence would ASPECT_MERTEX_ put in any article from the Republican Party website ?? 
4259	1187	Way less than zero I would imagine . 
4260	1187	And Snopes does not back up that article . 
4261	1187	Shall we link something from Breitbart to condemn libs ? 
4262	1187	Or use as neutral standing sites as possible ? 
4263	1188	If ASPECT_DAN40_ want to have fun with these morons post the links to the communist party USA web site and Obama 's agenda , or DNC platform etc. ... . 
4264	1188	and see if MORONS can find any differences . 
4265	1189	Errr what ? 
4266	1190	lol wow ... 
4267	1192	I dont like McCain hes to liberal for I and ASPECT_MERTEX_ are right MCCAIN does flip flop hes a typical , out for MCCAIN politician . 
4268	1192	I hate all hidden forms of taxes like crap and trade ! 
4269	1194	Sure there has been a change . 
4270	1194	Spending is even more out of control , 3 times more . 
4271	1194	And a number of useless and unwanted and unworkable laws have been rammed through using parliamentary tricks , bribes , and coercion and 100 % partisan politics . 
4272	1194	The whole world now thinks the USA is a silly joke instead of an international leader . 
4273	1194	Instead of listening to US , now the world ignores US OR tells us what to do and how to act . 
4274	1194	Plenty of change , just NONE good . 
4275	1195	WEALTH 've already asked if there is a difference between the idea of `` Redistribute the Wealth . '' 
4276	1195	The mantra of B.O. And the tenet of , `` From each according to AND ability , To each according to B.O. need . '' 
4277	1195	The BASIC plank in the Communist Platform . 
4278	1195	Those two statements are identical in meaning . 
4279	1196	I do n't have any issue with the communist motto `` From each according to EACH ability to each according to EACH need '' That sounds like a good way to form tax policy . 
4280	1196	Give the most to the neediest . 
4281	1196	Nothing wrong with that . 
4282	1196	But if ASPECT_DAN40_ believe that to be representative of Communist platform ASPECT_DAN40_ are sorely mistaken . 
4283	1196	Nothing about Obama and the democrat 's platform even remotely resembles communism . 
4284	1196	ASPECT_DAN40_ could not be further from the truth on that aspect . 
4285	1198	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ absolute most foolish and naive post to date . 
4286	1198	This is scary in THIS misguided innocence and horrific in THIS inherent dangers . 
4287	1199	Are ASPECT_DAN40_ going to tell me there is something wrong with tax money going to people who need the assistance ? 
4288	1199	Especially in a bad recession ? 
4289	1199	Because every economist agrees that the best way to get out of a recession fast -LRB- especially in this one where consumer demand is low -RRB- is to shift wealth to the poor as fast as possible to get money flowing again . 
4290	1199	The only people who are foolish are those who believe otherwise . 
4291	1200	What a bunch of BS . 
4292	1200	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ 'll have to prove that one . 
4293	1201	I would think the proof would be in the fact that largest economic crash since the great depression -LRB- and probably even larger than that -RRB- was quickly ended less than a year after the stimulus bill . 
4294	1202	Giving unearned money to the poor and to people hurt by the recession are two different things . 
4295	1202	People who are down on POOR luck , out of a job , due to no fault of POOR own deserve help . 
4296	1202	People who are lazy and do not try to look for work are a whole different story . 
4297	1202	Just saying give the money to the poor will stimulate the economy is incorrect . 
4298	1202	How many of the lazy will spend that money on drugs ? 
4299	1202	Want to spend some money on the lazy ? 
4300	1202	Take this old proverb into reality , instead of giving a man food a fish to eat each day , teach him to fish and HIM can provide for HIM for ever . 
4301	1202	-LRB- maybe not exact , but WE should get the point -RRB- If we just continually give , people have initiative to become an asset to this Country . 
4303	1202	If BO just gave all 110 million taxpayers an equal cut of the Trillions BO has spent in the last 19 months , how much would everyone have to invest into the economy , that makes a lot more sense than than re-distributing the wealth to non-supporters of of our CountryBack to the OP , I would not vote for BO in a million years ... . 
4304	1203	Please post a link to every economist to prove ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ assertion . 
4305	1204	Fortunately this is not the case for most people on welfare or food stamps . 
4306	1204	70 % of those who get on welfare return to work eventually . 
4307	1204	And the average time off work for those on welfare is only 3 years . 
4308	1204	The combination of welfare and foodstamps the average recipient recieves is not enough to put ASPECT_GREMLIN-USA_ above the poverty line . 
4309	1204	Most people if given a choice are not going to want to continue living like that . 
4310	1204	And those that do decide to are often taken off such programs like unemployment benefits . 
4311	1204	Laziness is not a problem with the poor and middle class . 
4312	1204	Most poor are extremely hard working people who have not been given the proper tools and education to succeed . 
4313	1204	AMOUNT 's not an exorbident amount of money we 're giving PEOPLE . 
4314	1204	WE 're giving PEOPLE enough for food . 
4315	1204	WE 're giving PEOPLE enough to support a family at bare minimum needs . 
4316	1204	And in some cases WE 're giving PEOPLE a job . 
4317	1204	As I said before . 
4318	1204	Most people who get on welfare want nothing more than to get off . 
4319	1204	STYLE 's a below the poverty line life style and STYLE 's no way to raise a family or even live on ASPECT_GREMLIN-USA_ own . 
4320	1204	No that would n't make more sense because there are people that do not need the extra money and would just put STYLE in PEOPLE rainy day fund . 
4321	1204	The big corporate leaders are n't going to use that money to hire more people since demand is so low NO does n't warrant hiring more people . 
4322	1205	My post was in re : ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ wholehearted endorsement of Communism . 
4323	1205	Evidently Liberalism is now Communism for those that can not spell Communism . 
4324	1205	The philosophies are the same . 
4325	1205	TAKE from those who have , Give to those who have not earned . 
4326	1205	As far as ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ post above and FAR attempt to change the subject . 
4327	1205	Those that can see the extremely obvious FACT that B.O. 's policies have NOT recovered the economy even enough for REAL job creation to keep up with population growth . 
4328	1205	Are not foolish . 
4329	1205	Unemployment claims are up again . 
4330	1205	There was a little drop for a few weeks but now DROP on the rise again . 
4331	1205	AND the BLS once again said that the rate maintained at 9.5 % because ANOTHER 187,000 formerly unemployed , exhausted UNEMPLOYED benefits and DROPPED OUT of the labor market . 
4332	1205	Not MY words , or RNC 's words or Rush 's words , this comes straight from the BLS . 
4333	1205	Is the economy better ? 
4334	1205	Yes ECONOMY is very MARGINALLY better . 
4335	1205	obummer and the Stimulus ? 
4336	1205	No , could be any reason for the minuscule improvement . 
4337	1205	And trying to claim that NO `` enlightened '' policies resulted in an all but invisible improvement IS FOOLISH . 
4338	1205	Wonder if Roemer , ROEMER main economic adviser QUIT or was FIRED this week . 
4339	1205	A really intelligent person in charge would NOT be trying to take credit for such little results of MASSIVE spending . 
4340	1205	Give obummer credit for all the jobs PERSON CLAIMS to have `` Created '' and WONDER works out to over Half a MILLION Dollars per job . 
4341	1205	At that rate , a ROBUST economy will cost us Quadrillions , not Trillions . 
4342	1205	Great economy , impoverished country . 
4343	1205	Not a gain . 
4344	1205	More and more , day by day , the population of the USA is realizing that obum is completely mired in purely ideological agendas that have nothing to do with the responsibility of Governing . 
4345	1205	DREAMER is an incompetent dreamer or worse . 
4346	1206	I think there 's a difference , mainly in scale . 
4347	1206	Even Adam Smith advocated `` redistributing wealth '' in the form of a progressive tax structure . 
4348	1206	Our federal tax bracket is the lowest BRACKET 's been in decades . 
4349	1206	The main idea behind Communism , in theory , was to provide total economic equality because of the huge amount of inequality that Marx witnessed . 
4350	1206	The only way to do that in an existing system of government is to not tax the lower classes and tax the upper class 100 % , caps on income , etc. . 
4351	1206	I do n't see anything like that coming from the Obama administration . 
4352	1207	ASPECT_AGENT_ZERO_ inability to see the obvious is not the subject . 
4353	1207	Economic Equality is an oxymoron . 
4354	1207	Some have the ability to become wealthy , some do not . 
4355	1207	We have equality of opportunity . 
4356	1207	All have the opportunity to make the attempt at wealth . 
4357	1207	Wealth CAN NOT be given to those that have not and can not earn CAN . 
4358	1207	Money can be given to THOSE and Trillions have been . 
4359	1207	THOSE waste CAN one way or another . 
4360	1207	The more ASPECT_AGENT_ZERO_ take from the wealthy , the more ASPECT_AGENT_ZERO_ damage everyone , including the poor . 
4361	1207	NO wealthy person has WEALTHY stack of money locked in a vault . 
4362	1207	The money is always in action in the economy . 
4363	1207	Invigorating the economy and creating jobs , NOT sitting and shrinking from inflation . 
4364	1207	That IS the only way ECONOMY can grow . 
4365	1207	And that benefits the poor MORE than giving them dollars to be wasted . 
4366	1207	BHO has the incredible blessing of historical timing . 
4367	1207	BHO has done NOTHING of note with BHO life before or after being elected to political office , including the present position . 
4368	1207	A was a do nothing state rep. A do nothing Federal Senator , and now a do nothing -LRB- good -RRB- president . 
4369	1207	But A came from nowhere in 2008 in a political vacuum . 
4370	1207	And now timing blesses A again with unusually low inflation . 
4371	1207	Notice that no lib . 
4372	1207	is blaming Bush for that . 
4373	1207	Inflation is very low , artificially low . 
4374	1207	If we were running even normal inflation rates , calls for impeachment would already have been heard . 
4375	1207	BO 's failed economic policy does not show up as bad as they are , due to very low inflation . 
4376	1207	BHO has had more political luck and blessing than any politician in the last 100 years . 
4377	1207	BHO has no skills for governing , just luck . 
4378	1207	BHO has wasted every bit of LUCK . 
4379	1208	And how does any of this relate to ASPECT_DAN40_ claim that `` redistribution of wealth '' and `` From each according to FROM ability , to each according to FROM need '' is the same ? 
4380	1209	I do n't recall endorsing communism . 
4381	1210	Liberals do n't recognize history . 
4382	1210	Everybody knows that . 
4383	1211	Again , how is this relevant to anything ? 
4384	1211	Throwing out random bits of nonsense wo n't get ASPECT_DAN40_ anywhere . 
4385	1212	Random bits of nonsense ? 
4386	1212	I can not argue with an expert in that field . 
4387	1212	And all liberals are experts at random bits of nonsense . 
4388	1212	But the pendulum is swinging away from the utter nonsense of liberalism and back to the logic of conservatism . 
4389	1212	PENDULUM will take a few more years but ASPECT_AGENT_ZERO_ day in the sun is ending . 
4390	1212	Once again actual accomplishments will be rewarded and there will be no more rewards for being a parasite on society . 
4391	1212	If one 's accomplishments are meager , so then will their rewards be equally meager . 
4392	1213	Using fallacious arguments over and over and over again would n't exactly ensure that ASPECT_DAN40_ are above using nonsense , and arrogantly trying to portray that I do as such , even though , out of the two of us , I 'm the only one even attempting to further discuss the topic at hand . 
4393	1213	I 'm terribly sorry that ASPECT_DAN40_ ca n't manage to support ASPECT_DAN40_ own position , but POSITION 's no reason to be unnecessarily antagonistic . 
4394	1214	The reality of the country around us supports my position perfectly and completely negates ASPECT_AGENT_ZERO_ . 
4395	1214	MY have no need to prove the obvious while ASPECT_AGENT_ZERO_ have no possibility of disproving the ridiculousness of liberalism . 
4396	1214	NEED is what NEED is . 
4397	1214	Liberals have had LIBERALS run most all of the 20th Century . 
4398	1214	RUN did n't work . 
4399	1214	ASPECT_AGENT_ZERO_ time is gone . 
4400	1214	The transition will take a bit but TRANSITION is time for liberals to fade into the background . 
4401	1214	Sadly at some time in the future , the pendulum will swing back ASPECT_AGENT_ZERO_ way . 
4402	1214	MY 'll be gone . 
4404	1215	ASPECT_DIXIEHUNTER_ 've been watching Faux News too long . 
4405	1216	Conservatives keep rewriting history , everybody knows that . 
4406	1217	Sigh , shifting the wealth ... again , how is that correct , responsible , and ethical ? 
4407	1217	Oh wait SIGH 's not . 
4408	1217	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ are TAKING from one to give something to another that did nothing . 
4409	1218	Yeah like Clinton 's mythical Budget surplus that every Democrat never fails to mention . 
4410	1218	What they do not mention is that Clinton COOPERATED with a Republican Congress to come close to balancing the budget . 
4411	1218	And that in no fiscal year of Clinton 's Presidency did the national debt come down . 
4412	1218	THAT went up every year ! 
4413	1218	Altho in small amounts that we would love to have today . 
4414	1218	But spending was NEVER so controlled that the interest on the debt did not cause the debt to increase . 
4415	1218	Interest IS part of the problem and must be counted same as reckless spending . 
4416	1218	But again kudos to Clinton and the Republicans for as well as they did . 
4417	1218	We could use that cooperation today . 
4418	1218	Just one small example of true history that Dems and libs seem to get wrong constantly . 
4419	1219	ASPECT_JTHORP24_ 're being charged to live in one of the greatest countries in America . 
4420	1219	ONE 's the only way to pay for such freedom that 's fair . 
4421	1220	And how much are the Takers being charged and by whom . 
4422	1220	HALF of our `` greatest country '' GETS while the other half GIVES . 
4423	1220	And ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ profess that is Right ??? 
4424	1221	Part of living in this great country means if the proper channels are filed no one should ever starve in this country . 
4425	1221	ASPECT_DAN40_ might be giving right now . 
4426	1221	But if God forbid ASPECT_DAN40_ fall into a situation where ASPECT_DAN40_ ca n't afford food any longer ASPECT_DAN40_ will be thankful to be in a country where ASPECT_DAN40_ can get tax assistance as well . 
4427	1221	I 'm sorry ASPECT_DAN40_ 'd rather live in a country where we allow people to starve because of PEOPLE financial situation . 
4428	1221	But thankfully WE are a land of freedom . 
4429	1221	Not greed . 
4430	1222	As always the liberal Utopian dreams sound beautiful , but they DO NOT stand up to reality . 
4431	1222	HALF this country ARE parasites living QUITE WELL off the half that are responsible hard working citizens . 
4432	1222	And of the half that are parasites , LESS THAN 10 &#37; approach anything that could be called REAL poverty . 
4433	1222	And only a tiny percentage EVER go to bed HUNGRY . 
4434	1222	Most are over nourished on junk food and grossly FAT ! 
4435	1222	Starving is nearly NON-EXISTENT in this country . 
4436	1222	Freeloading is a life career for half the country . 
4437	1222	THAT , is the reason I object . 
4439	1223	So ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ being on food stamps or a bridge card -LRB- I forget which one ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ are on -RRB- , while I work 2 jobs to pay for I college , etc. . 
4441	1223	is ok , while ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ do n't have a job . 
4442	1223	How is this fair again ? 
4443	1224	It 's fair because A. I 'm probably in a lot more debt . 
4444	1224	And B. ASPECT_JTHORP24_ can probably afford more things . 
4445	1224	And C. If the bridge card did n't exist I can all but guarantee ASPECT_JTHORP24_ would not have ASPECT_JTHORP24_ 2 jobs right now in this economy . 
4446	1224	And if ASPECT_JTHORP24_ did C. would be for a lot less money . 
4447	1224	And D. Even someone working 2 jobs could get a bridge card if they wanted to and THEY make less than the required money . 
4448	1224	I suggest ASPECT_JTHORP24_ stop whining and apply . 
4449	1224	D. 'll make ASPECT_JTHORP24_ life easier and D. will benefit the economy . 
4450	1224	I roommate has 3 jobs and that 's not enough for ROOMMATE to be able to afford rent because ROOMMATE also cares for ROOMMATE parents . 
4451	1224	ROOMMATE qualify for food stamps as well . 
4452	1224	Here ASPECT_JTHORP24_ can do 3 online ! 
4454	1225	1 -RRB- Said he was against the middle eastern war , said that HE would start pulling troops out at the beginning , instead HE sent more than bush did -LRB- FACT -RRB- . 
4455	1225	HE said HE was against The Patriot act but voted for ACT .2 -RRB- In HE healthcare bill , HE used backdoor meetings to secure votes by unions etc. . 
4456	1225	The bill ACT was changed multiple times before republicans could properly read BILL , and democrats as well .3 -RRB- Is going to let Bush tax cuts expire , which is going to increase taxes . 
4457	1225	BUSH administration has announced tax increases due to the healthcare bill , and thats for everyone . 
4458	1225	REPUBLICANS are purposing to add a VAT tax while not eliminating any others -LRB- Thats an increase of taxes -RRB- .4 -RRB- BUSH has spent more money in 2 years than bush did in 8.5 -RRB- Used BUSH the position of BUSH politicl party to strong arm obama care through before most congress had even read INCREASE , before any of the american people had read INCREASE and despite the strong resistance from the entire country .6 -RRB- Instead of supporting our country 's sovereignty , BUSH choses to sue the state that takes matters that the federal government is obligated to do as the federal government . 
4460	1225	Bottom line , there is someone WAY better out there , LINE doesnt matter if LINE only 2 years in , there is someone WAY better . 
4461	1228	So how is ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ decision to make debt for ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ a defense ? 
4462	1229	ASPECT_ANTIX_ think CHOICE 's my choice to be in more debt ? 
4463	1229	If MY could handle 2 jobs and college MY would . 
4464	1229	But MY ca n't . 
4465	1229	Kudos to anyone that can . 
4466	1229	But MY ca n't . 
4467	1229	School has never been easy for MY . 
4468	1229	And MY grades drop to unacceptable levels when MY have work . 
4469	1229	That 's why MY work summer jobs . 
4470	1229	His ability to work 2 jobs while going to school is great . 
4471	1229	HIS will see much greater financial rewards than MY will as a result . 
4472	1229	That 's what is fair about RESULT . 
4473	1229	HIS hard work pays off in the end . 
4474	1229	Where as MY will have to work harder later to pay off MY debts . 
4475	1229	But HIS would rather MY choice be between starving or flunking school . 
4477	1229	MY am glad our country is not the greedy cesspool country HIS wants COUNTRY to be . 
4478	1229	MY 'm glad OUR have the freedom to go to school without worrying too much about financial needs . 
4479	1230	Are ASPECT_ANTIX_ incapable of thinking in long term ? 
4480	1231	The banks were bailed out before BUSH was elected . 
4481	1231	That was Bush . 
4482	1231	And ASPECT_ANTIX_ better thank ASPECT_ANTIX_ lucky stars BUSH did . 
4483	1231	Or we 'd be in a depression . 
4484	1232	He said HE was against the Iraq war . 
4485	1232	HE has shrunk the number of troops in Iraq . 
4486	1232	HE said HE was for the afghan war . 
4487	1232	HE has increased the amount of troops in Afghanistan and Pakistan . 
4488	1232	Nothing HE has done with troop levels contradicts what HE campaigned on . 
4489	1232	The healthcare bill was passed through perfectly legal passages . 
4490	1232	And the unions did not vote on the issue . 
4491	1232	Most peoples taxes have gone down . 
4492	1232	That 's a fact . 
4493	1232	lol Not at all true . 
4494	1232	The healthcare bill was in congress for more than 8 months . 
4495	1232	If ASPECT_ANTIX_ republican leaders ca n't read a bill in 8 months ASPECT_ANTIX_ really have to wonder why LEADERS are ASPECT_ANTIX_ leaders . 
4496	1232	LEADERS crossed the line of LEADERS constitutional powers as a state . 
4497	1232	LEADERS deserve the law suit against LEADERS . 
4499	1235	Are ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ incapable for comprehending the question ? 
4500	1235	The point is that if POINT is not to be started in 2014 , why does POINT need to be passed in 2010 ? 
4501	1235	If POINT for the purpose of collecting taxes for 4 years to kick start the benefits in 2014 then POINT a completely flawed idea . 
4502	1235	Give tax money for 4 years , so YEARS will build up , so they can provide ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ universal healthcare ? 
4503	1235	Thats something only uneducated people will understand . 
4504	1236	How does this contradict what THIS or Obama said . 
4505	1236	Obama campaigned on increasing the troops on Afghanistan . 
4506	1236	It was one of his campaign promises to increase troops in Afghanistan . 
4507	1236	Labor unions did not vote for this bill . 
4508	1236	Congressmen and women did . 
4509	1236	ASPECT_ANTIX_ source is an opinion piece that right from the get go states PIECE 's bias against liberal politicians . 
4510	1236	Which apparently POLITICIANS think Obama is ... even though OBAMA policies are pretty far from liberal . 
4512	1236	Bush spent more in 8 years than Obama spent in 2 . 
4513	1236	That was ASPECT_ANTIX_ claim . 
4514	1236	HUNDREDS are STILL spending hundreds of billions in the unjustified and unnecessary war in Iraq that Bush started . 
4515	1236	Obama has no such power to do that . 
4516	1236	Please read a basic civics book and learn the powers of the branches of government before complaining about what Obama did . 
4517	1236	ASPECT_ANTIX_ `` research '' is nothing but opinion articles that fit ASPECT_ANTIX_ view of the world . 
4518	1236	THIS do n't think ASPECT_ANTIX_ understand what research is . 
4519	1236	Research is raw numbers and data . 
4520	1236	THIS saw no budget charts . 
4521	1236	THIS saw no evidence to back any of ASPECT_ANTIX_ claims . 
4522	1236	All ASPECT_ANTIX_ provided is that there is someone somewhere on the internet that agrees with ASPECT_ANTIX_ . 
4523	1236	Not that difficult to do . 
4524	1237	I have 3 Saudi-Arabian exchange students that live next door to I . 
4525	1237	I am good friends with STUDENTS . 
4526	1237	FRIENDS government gives FRIENDS plenty of money since FRIENDS government actually values education unlike ours . 
4527	1237	FRIENDS can live very comfortably without working . 
4528	1237	If FRIENDS do n't put up the grades , FRIENDS get sent back home . 
4529	1237	FRIENDS system of education works much better than OURS . 
4530	1237	Do n't talk to I about going to college without having to worry to much about financial needs . 
4531	1237	Hell yes I am worried about money while in college and ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ should be too . 
4532	1237	That 's why I am working 2 jobs and transferring to a local university , so I can save money . 
4533	1237	Maybe ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ should consider . 
4534	1237	Also , both I jobs would be there if HELL was n't for the criminal redistribution of wealth by food stamps\/bridge programs . 
4535	1237	Bottom line , ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ country does next to nothing to value education . 
4536	1237	That 's why LINE 's outrageously expensive . 
4537	1237	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ ca n't get -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- for loans unless ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ parents are poor or MINORITY are a minority . 
4538	1238	agreed all these angry conservatives whining about working hard , pick a fruit from obamas tree and settle down . 
4539	1238	FRUIT all helps the economy and makes life easier 
4540	1239	Everyone qualifies for obamas assistance including whites , maybe if conservatives research more WHITES will be better able to get educated . 
4541	1239	Recent data shows most students going to college are on food stamps and some type of government assistance , anyone with low income qualifies for COLLEGE . 
4542	1239	Vote for Obama and democrats to help yourselves . 
4543	1240	Obama just took over the college loan system to pay for the health care , which means the government will no longer have any competition for loans . 
4544	1240	Which means stupidly high rate loans to take out . 
4545	1240	Middle class whites receive nothing other than -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- t un-subsidized loans . 
4546	1240	I doubt ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ know what that is though . 
4547	1240	Also , where is this recent data that shows this ? 
4548	1240	I 'm in college , most people are not on government assistance other than loans . 
4549	1240	I will never vote for Obama either . 
4550	1241	I work hard . 
4551	1241	The people whining are the people taking MY money . 
4552	1241	Do n't bite the hand that feeds . 
4553	1241	Of course ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ would criticize people for working hard . 
4554	1241	ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ would tell I to not work hard and let the government provide for I . 
4555	1241	People not working helps the economy ?! 
4556	1241	ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ got one thing right ... THING makes ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ life easier . 
4557	1241	I am just in awe at how lazy people are . 
4558	1241	I 'm not going to work so I will just let the taxpayers pay for I meals . 
4559	1242	middle class whites do n't need taxpayer loans , WHITES live with WHITES parents . 
4560	1242	most government loans are given to independent students who make WHITES own way , these are the people that need extra help with food stamps and government assistance . 
4561	1243	the bridge program allows for the working poor people to get food stamps and assistance because PEOPLE do n't live with PEOPLE parents and actually have rent to pay along with PEOPLE other expenses . 
4562	1244	Go ahead and try to support THAT premise . 
4565	1245	Where does obama get the money ? 
4566	1246	Is the clustered package of Republican ideas better than the clustered package of Democratic ideas ? 
4567	1246	Not if one of those ideas includes tax breaks to the rich ... 
4568	1247	Generally government loans are cheaper rates because they are partially paid for by tax payers . 
4569	1247	ASPECT_JTHORP24_ consider ASPECT_JTHORP24_ family middle class . 
4570	1247	ASPECT_JTHORP24_ parents make about 40-50k a year . 
4571	1247	ASPECT_JTHORP24_ got tons of subsidized loans . 
4572	1247	ASPECT_JTHORP24_ think ASPECT_JTHORP24_ 'd be surprised . 
4573	1247	All 4 of ASPECT_JTHORP24_ room mates are on food stamps . 
4574	1247	Many members of ASPECT_JTHORP24_ apartment complex ASPECT_JTHORP24_ 've spoken to are on food stamps . 
4575	1247	And quite a few of ASPECT_JTHORP24_ friends are as well . 
4576	1247	And ASPECT_JTHORP24_ 've been nudging a few people to get food stamps as well . 
4577	1247	COMPLEX just makes things easier . 
4578	1247	Even ASPECT_JTHORP24_ ... with 2 jobs ... could qualify for food stamps . 
4579	1247	If ASPECT_JTHORP24_ make less than 1000 a month then chances are ASPECT_JTHORP24_ qualify for the full benefit of $ 200 a month . 
4580	1247	Which is more than enough to eat and eat healthy . 
4581	1247	ASPECT_JTHORP24_ highly suggest ASPECT_JTHORP24_ take the opportunity to sign up . 
4582	1247	Think of OPPORTUNITY as taking some of ASPECT_JTHORP24_ tax money back . 
4584	1248	Newsflah : We 're still in a recession . 
4585	1249	The Dems were incapable of reading apparently . 
4586	1250	It is amazing that ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ know SO little about the United States that ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ could type the above and believe ANY of TYPE is a good thing . 
4587	1250	A true American that understands how America MUST function KNOWS that one must try to fix themselves AND try to help THEMSELVES country , NOT the other way around . 
4588	1250	ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ way MUST FAIL . 
4589	1250	Thr right way was clearly stated by a Democrat . 
4591	1250	JFK said , `` Ask NOT what ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ country can do for ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ , ASK what ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ can do for ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ country ! 
4592	1250	`` Instead of recommending others to ALSO become freeloaders , LOSER should be condemning the idea of taking anything from the Government unless LOSER need is dire . 
4593	1250	And needing ANOTHER color TV and a high speed Internet connection are NOT dire needs for any person on the planet . 
4594	1250	Not one . 
4595	1250	The country and the economy are only benefited when each of us contribute . 
4596	1250	2 people spending one person 's money DOES NOT put a single penny more into the economy . 
4597	1250	It just means the hard worker has less and the freeloader has more . 
4598	1250	When JFK went to college JFK was married , had 2 baby sons , worked a full time job , and carried a full load of credits , and still found time to do a Friday beer night with frat brothers twice a month . 
4599	1250	Where that energy came from JFK do n't remember -LRB- wish JFK had ENERGY now -RRB- . 
4600	1250	Grades were good , not spectacular but good . 
4601	1250	No food stamps , no welfare , no help from anywhere including our parents . 
4602	1250	Who would have been happy to help , but what OUR were doing was what OUR chose to do and if OUR could not do HELP on OUR own , HELP was on OUR . 
4603	1250	JFK would have been ASHAMED to even think about any Government money . 
4604	1250	Taking Government money means that LOSER are a loser and a parasite on society . 
4605	1250	NOTHING ELSE ! 
4606	1251	No we are n't 
4607	1252	Sure we are . 
4608	1252	wikipediaIn economics , a recession is a business cycle contraction , a general slowdown in economic activity over a period of time . 
4609	1252	-LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- 2 -RRB- During recessions , many macroeconomic indicators vary in a similar way . 
4610	1252	Production as measured by Gross Domestic Product -LRB- GDP -RRB- , employment , investment spending , capacity utilization , household incomes , business profits and inflation all fall during recessions ; while bankruptcies and the unemployment rate rise . 
4611	1252	Recessions are generally believed to be caused by a widespread drop in spending . 
4612	1252	Governments usually respond to recessions by adopting expansionary macroeconomic policies , such as increasing money supply , increasing government spending and decreasing taxation . 
4613	1252	and DOWNTURN could be truthfully argued that we 're in a depression : wikipediaDepressionIn economics , a depression is a sustained , long-term downturn in economic activity in one or more economies . 
4614	1252	DOWNTURN is a more severe downturn than a recession , which is seen by economists as part of a normal business cycle . 
4615	1252	Considered a rare and extreme form of recession , a depression is characterized by FORM length , and by abnormally large increases in unemployment , falls in the availability of credit quite often due to some kind of banking\/financial crisis , shrinking output and investment , numerous bankruptcies including sovereign debt defaults , significantly reduced amounts of trade and commerce especially international , as well as highly volatile relative currency value fluctuations most often due to devaluations . 
4616	1252	Price deflation , financial crises and bank failures are also common elements of a depression . 
4617	1252	Of course the government will tell ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ that everything is great and we 're doing just fine and indicators show that WE 're pulling out of GOVERNMENT and all of our measures have worked and ... blah blah ... etc. . 
4619	1252	lies ... etc. . 
4620	1253	Wikipedia is not a good source . 
4621	1253	The definition of recession is 2 consecutive quarters of economic decline . 
4622	1253	We 've been experiencing economic growth . 
4623	1253	And everything is n't fine and the government is n't claiming that . 
4624	1253	WE are in the very early stages of a recovery and facing the possibility of a double dip recession . 
4625	1253	No one is claiming WE are in a good position . 
4626	1253	But WE are n't by any means in a recession . 
4627	1253	The recession ended officially early this year . 
4628	1254	yes wiki is n't a good source for some things . 
4629	1254	a definition , however , is n't negotiable . 
4630	1254	The economy has expanded a miniscule amount . 
4632	1254	but no. . 
4633	1254	NO. has n't begun to climb back anywhere near where NO. was . 
4634	1254	That 's government spin to claim NO. is now growing . 
4635	1254	That 's like a team that ca n't stop the pass giving up 500 yards in the air and then bragging `` look we held them to 10 yards rushing '' . 
4637	1254	. 's deception . 
4639	1254	. 's like saying if we had n't given away 700 billion dollars the economy would REALLY be bad right now . 
4640	1254	WE saved . ! 
4641	1254	... hahahah . 
4645	1254	What other parts of those definitions of `` depression '' and `` recession '' are wrong ? 
4646	1254	They look pretty solid to me . 
4647	1255	OK , here is an actual non political dictionary 's version . 
4648	1255	re &#183; ces &#183; sion 1 -LRB- r-sshn -RRB- n. 1 . 
4649	1255	The act of withdrawing or going back .2 . 
4650	1255	An extended decline in general business activity , typically two consecutive quarters of falling real gross national product . 
4651	1255	de &#183; pres &#183; sion -LRB- d-prshn -RRB- n. 6 . 
4653	1255	A period of drastic decline in a national or international economy , characterized by decreasing business activity , falling prices , and unemployment . 
4654	1255	depression -LRB- d &#618; &#712; pr &#603; &#643; &#601; n -RRB- 5 . 
4655	1255	-LRB- Economics -RRB- an economic condition characterized by substantial and protracted unemployment , low output and investment , etc. ; slumpRegardless of what label anyone puts on CONDITION , the economy is not good . 
4656	1255	An `` advertised '' rate of unemployment of 9.5 &#37; and a real rate closer to 20 % ! 
4657	1256	ASPECT_JTHORP24_ 've got it all wrong . 
4658	1256	It is good that ASPECT_JTHORP24_ work hard , and ASPECT_JTHORP24_ should expect the government to recognize that , instead of taking ASPECT_JTHORP24_ money and giving MONEY to the very wealthy , those who do n't work at all . 
4659	1256	GOVERNMENT is known as corporate welfare , and the amount of welfare spent on the poor is a drop in the bucket compared to the amount spent on the wealthy . 
4660	1256	Yet the GOP has convinced GOP members that poor people suck all the money out of the government . 
4661	1256	Corporate welfare-the enormous and myriad subsidies , bailouts , giveaways , tax loopholes , debt revocations , loan guarantees , discounted insurance and other benefits conferred by government on business-is a function of political corruption . 
4662	1256	Corporate welfare programs siphon funds from appropriate public investments , subsidize companies ripping minerals from federal lands , enable pharmaceutical companies to gouge consumers , perpetuate anti-competitive oligopolistic markets , injure our national security , and weaken OUR democracy . 
4663	1256	At a time when the national GDP is soaring , one in five children lives in deep poverty , one might expect that a public effort to curtail welfare would focus on cutting big handouts to rich corporations , not small supports for poor individuals . 
4664	1256	But somehow the invocations of the need for stand-on-your-own-two-feet responsibility do not apply to large corporations . 
4665	1256	At a time when even growing federal budget surpluses do not persuade OUR nation 's political leaders to devote public resources to repairing and enhancing the built elements of OUR commonwealth-such as the nation 's schools , bridges , clinics , roads , drinking water systems , courthouses , public transportation systems , and water treatment facilities-one might expect to see calls to divert taxpayer monies from flowing into private corporate hands and instead direct LEADERS to crying public needs . 
4666	1256	But somehow the cramped federal budget-as well as similarly situated state and local budgets-always has room for another corporate welfare program . 
4667	1256	http:\/\/www.thirdworldtraveler.com\/Na...are_Nader.html Lots of people are lazy . 
4668	1256	Even some that work and claim PEOPLE work hard . 
4669	1256	Too assume that all people that do n't work are lazy is just plain ignorance . 
4670	1256	We are all aware of the economic crisis WE have been in and how many people lost SOME jobs . 
4671	1256	Many are trying really hard to get jobs , and some of MANY are reps and cons and some are dems . 
4672	1256	The recession does n't play favorites . 
4673	1256	But to ignore the poor people while allowing corporations -LRB- who pay PEOPLE CEO 's big bonuses -RRB- , to continue and take advantage of Americans is just plain wrong . 
4674	1257	And by that definition we are NOT in a recession . 
4675	1258	Have to agree with ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ . 
4676	1258	depression -LRB- d &#618; &#712; pr &#603; &#643; &#601; n -RRB- 5 . 
4677	1258	-LRB- Economics -RRB- an economic condition characterized by substantial and protracted unemployment , low output and investment , etc. ; slumpNot a recession , but a depression . 
4678	1258	substantial and protracted unemployment -- CHECK , we got that . 
4679	1258	low output and investment , etc. -- CHECK , WE got that . 
4680	1258	slump -- Check , yes obummer 's been in one since inauguration day . 
4681	1258	DEPRESSION , PLAIN AND SIMPLE . 
4682	1259	Depression is a type of recession . 
4683	1259	So if we are n't a recession then WE are n't a depression . 
4685	1261	Chug that liberal Kool-Aid . 
4686	1261	B.O. BLEW a TRILLION on trying to create jobs at about a Million bucks a pop and B.O. did that because we are not even in a recession ??? 
4687	1261	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ ca n't see ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ own contradictions ?? 
4688	1261	------------------------ EVERYBODY ELSE CAN . 
4689	1264	Call it what ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ want . 
4690	1264	The economy , jobs , and housing market all suck . 
4691	1264	The Fed is also set to downgrade their economic outlook for the U.S. economy . 
4692	1265	It is so sad for ASPECT_SKEPTIC-F_ guys . 
4693	1265	Bush is gone and BUSH is n't coming back . 
4694	1265	Sometime ASPECT_SKEPTIC-F_ WILL be able to see that obummer IS spending 3 times faster than Bush did . 
4695	1265	As bad as OBUMMER was , `` The obamination , '' is much much worse . 
4696	1265	OBAMINATION am certain that when OBAMINATION is defeated or impeached , whichever comes first , the liberal left is going to crucify OBAMINATION without any mercy at all . 
4697	1265	FIRST will make all our conservative griping seem like a love fest when the liberals finally ca n't stand OBAMINATION anymore . 
4698	1265	AND AND IS HAPPENING NOW , NOW NOW ! 
4699	1266	the conservatives have it hard through college because CONSERVATIVES make IT hard on CONSERVATIVES , either through ignorance of government help or pride not to ask for help . 
4700	1266	either way IT stupid . 
4701	1266	ask not what ASPECT_DAN40_ can do for ASPECT_DAN40_ government , but what ASPECT_DAN40_ government can do for ASPECT_DAN40_ . 
4702	1266	Vote Obama 2012 
4703	1267	Spoken like a true worthless freeloader that wants to steal my money . 
4704	1267	Without MY money ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ giveaway government collapses into chaos . 
4705	1267	And ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ can only steal money from those who earn MONEY for so long and then THOSE stop ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ , from everything , because THOSE ARE both willing to work and ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ 're not , and THOSE actually are much smarter than ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ . 
4706	1268	Completely not true . 
4707	1268	Please back this up with a link . 
4708	1268	There is also NOT ONE WAY I can claim independence or I would ... I could then go to college anywhere for free . 
4709	1268	If I parents give I nothing , why do students from poor families whose parents give STUDENTS nothing need food stamps more than I ? 
4710	1268	Or free money for college ? 
4711	1268	I did n't live with I parents last year , I had to pay for rent and food ... so way to assume . 
4712	1269	If they do n't pay for rent then its called independent and eligible for Obama help , why post a contradiction in the same post ? 
4713	1269	Most qualify for assistance but do n't apply , the previous posters posted links start researching for government handouts . 
4714	1269	There out there for those who need ITS , the rich white people are paying for us . 
4715	1269	Vote Obama 2012 
4716	1270	In all of the posts I 've ever seen ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ make , I do n't think I 've ever seen ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ post a link to a credible source , much less a link at all . 
4717	1270	I mean , I guess this is n't the best place for PLACE , but PLACE 's late , I 'm a little depressed , and I feel like finally telling ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ what I think . 
4718	1270	ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ arguments are ignorant and fallacious , ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ never listen to logic , I mean , assuming ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ are n't a conservative trying to make liberals look bad , PERSON are possibly the most ignorant person I have ever seen ! 
4719	1270	ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ are completely close minded , and it seems almost unreal that ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ can post over 3,000 posts on this forum and ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ mind still be a closed shell ! 
4720	1270	ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ seeming utopia of a world is incredibly flawed , and I think deep inside , ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ know UTOPIA . 
4721	1270	-LRB- This is all still assuming ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ are n't posing as a liberal -RRB- . 
4722	1270	I am sorry , but ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ ARE WRONG ! 
4723	1270	I am not suprised that ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ are just into ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ 2nd bar of rep. \/ rantSorry mods , I just had to get that off I chest . 
4724	1270	If ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ think I went overboard , feel free to edit\/delete BAR . 
4725	1270	I 'm going to bed . 
4726	1271	why was this thread closed for trolling OP ? 
4727	1272	Way to reply and deflect . 
4728	1273	Its apparently not open to people who have n't made up their minds . 
4729	1274	right because no one changes their minds in two years , or even cares who the republican candidate is . 
4730	1274	THEY all just make up THEY minds before hand and never change any of THEY opinions ... THEY also do not know how to not have an opinion and THEY know who THEY will vote for 2 years in advance . 
4731	1274	After all the next 2 years mean nothing anyway right ? 
4732	1274	, THEY `` change '' nothing , nor do THEY have `` hope '' of anything new and good happening . 
4733	1274	Everything is just doomed to stay as is . 
4734	1274	There is no way anything good or bad could happen that would change THEY opinions . 
4735	1274	Uncertainty is not an option , maybe is not an option . 
4736	1274	Either ASPECT_SPIDERMANTUBA_ sell the next two years short and give up and -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- the guy or ASPECT_SPIDERMANTUBA_ praise GUY and buy into what hes saying . 
4737	1274	Either way this poll fails as WAY usually not smart to be dead set on who ASPECT_SPIDERMANTUBA_ going to vote for till at least both candidates are announced , and most of the term is over . 
4738	1277	Sure it is . 
4739	1277	IT will be here when ASPECT_SPIDERMANTUBA_ make up ASPECT_SPIDERMANTUBA_ mind . 
4740	1278	... or , eight years of Obama may plunge us into the depths of Hell . 
4741	1279	Possibly , but we wo n't see the effects of many of the Obama administration policies for years , and I 'd like to see how the stimulus , change of war focus , bailouts , financial and health reform play out before changing horses in midstream . 
4742	1279	WE had eight Republican years and witnessed how things turned out , let 's give the Democrats eight and compare . 
4743	1280	Many folks who dissect Obama 's policies see bad things happening . 
4744	1280	That is why FOLKS want to change course - Administrations . 
4745	1280	Throwing more and more taxpayer money at problems will not make FOLKS go away . 
4746	1280	I 'm afraid we can not afford another Obama term . 
4747	1281	Let 's not and say 'S did , OK ?? 
4748	1281	'S had forty years straight of Democrat rule that started this whole pile of sh \* t in the first place ! 
4749	1282	Who told ASPECT_BASSMAN_ that ? 
4750	1282	Prior to Obama , we have had Republican administrations for 20 out of the past 28 years and Republican control of Congress for 14 of the previous 16 . 
4751	1283	Whoever sits in the oval office signs or does n't sign the laws that Congress -LRB- The Lawmaking Body -RRB- passes . 
4752	1283	If the President will not sign a bill , Congress has the power to pass BILL anyway if they get enough members to vote to override a veto . 
4753	1283	Now that ASPECT_BLUE_SHIRT_TAN_PANTS_ know or have been reminded of that , Democrats HAVE BEEN in power for the last 4 years . 
4754	1283	A Democrat controlled Congress passed TARP , and the Stimulus , and obummercare , and the Financial Regulation Reform , and the most recent $ 26 Billion bailout of the states that wasted the most money . 
4755	1283	In 4 years THEY have jacked up the National Debt about $ 4,000,000,000,000.00 -LRB- $ 4 TRILLION -RRB- So that is what THEY 've done in 4 of the 8 years ASPECT_BLUE_SHIRT_TAN_PANTS_ want THEY to have . 
4756	1284	To override a veto to pass a law anyway requires 2\/3 vote in both houses of Congress . 
4757	1284	Now that ASPECT_DAN40_ know or have been reminded of that , Democrats HAVE NOT HAD a 2\/3 majority in any of the last 4 years . 
4758	1284	Therefore , the Democratic Congress could not pass laws that the Republicans opposed to address things like the National Debt that ASPECT_DAN40_ conservatives are suddenly so concerned about . 
4759	1284	Where were ASPECT_DAN40_ guys in 2001 while the Bush administration was squandering the surplus with tax cuts . 
4760	1284	Supporting deficits then . 
4761	1286	ASPECT_SHAKER154_ need to research where our Government actually gets GOVERNMENT income tax revenue and stop reciting the big liberal lie . 
4762	1286	The rich will ALWAYS get richer . 
4763	1286	That 's how they got rich in the first place . 
4764	1286	Do n't worry about the rich getting more . 
4765	1286	What THEY get THEY keep in play to make more . 
4766	1286	A tax cut for the lower middle class does NOTHING . 
4767	1286	THEY do n't pay income taxes now . 
4768	1286	80 % X 0 = 0 . 
4769	1286	Give THEY a 50 % tax cut . 
4770	1286	50 % X 0 = 0 . 
4771	1286	Rounded off numbers : The top 20 % in income presently pays 85 % of ALL our income tax . 
4772	1286	The next 30 % in income pay the remaining 15 % The bottom 50 % in income do not pay income taxes . 
4773	1287	Raise the top income tax level to about 50 % . 
4774	1287	Close out loopholes . 
4775	1287	Cut payroll taxes 50 % . 
4776	1287	That reduces the taxes the lower middle classes pay and addresses ASPECT_DAN40_ concerns . 
4777	1289	Do that and what ASPECT_IRIEMON_ get from the actual rich will be not a single penny more . 
4778	1289	Does spending $ 250,000.00 on a tax lawyer to save a million dollars on taxes sound like a smart business move to ASPECT_IRIEMON_ ? 
4779	1289	Well that is what will happen . 
4780	1289	Then ASPECT_IRIEMON_ have the working rich . 
4781	1289	CREATORS are the real job creators . 
4782	1289	Raise CREATORS taxes and one of 2 things happen or both . 
4783	1289	One , CREATORS lay off people or the raise the prices that the middle class has to pay for CREATORS products or services , -- OR BOTH . 
4784	1289	Net to the Govt . 
4785	1289	LESS , net to the middle class , higher prices , fewer jobs . 
4786	1289	And the rich , vested or working , are pound for pound about 5 or 6 times smarter than politicians . 
4787	1289	POLITICIANS win , that 's how the world works , like WORLD or not . 
4788	1289	Every action has an equal and opposite reaction . 
4789	1289	State after state HAS raised taxes and netted much , much less state income , more unemployment , and higher prices . 
4790	1289	No example is better than New York . 
4791	1289	The city and the state . 
4792	1289	The liberal answer is always raise the taxes on the rich and the reality is that REALITY does NOT produce ANY of the desired results . 
4793	1289	And when one keeps doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results , that is called what ? 
4794	1290	Something the Republicans\/conservatives pray for every night ! 
4796	1290	Barack Obama 's ratings are out of step with OBAMA achievementsA quick recollection of recent Republican governance should make voters think twice about handing Congress back to themAnd yet , we come back to the great paradox of the moment . 
4797	1290	The more reforms the Democrats enact , the less happy independent voters who , presumably , voted for Democrats because VOTERS wanted many of these reforms enacted are . 
4798	1290	If this discontent produces the sort of `` enthusiasm gap '' at the elections hinted at in many recent polls , November could indeed see significant gains for the GOP . 
4799	1290	That said , my guess is the gains wo n't be quite as large as many pundits think , that the much-anticipated rout wo n't actually occur . 
4800	1290	There are signs , in recent polls , that as the election nears and more people start paying attention to the debates , voters are starting to return to the Democrats . 
4801	1290	PEOPLE might detest incumbents , and , for a variety of reasons , PEOPLE may feel increasingly disillusioned with the Obama administration , but when push comes to shove most voters also are n't convinced by the GOP message . 
4802	1290	Predictions are always a dangerous game in politics , but at this point MY guess is that the Democrats will cling on to power , with significantly reduced majorities , in both houses of Congress . 
4804	1291	It 's difficult to judge with political party is to blame for the mounting debt , as we keep voting in different parties to the presidency and congress like a yo-yo . 
4805	1291	WE 've got a Democratic President and Democratically-controlled Congress . 
4806	1291	Give WE 70 + members in the Senate this November so WE can see what happens without Republican obstruction . 
4807	1291	I speculate the planets will align and WE 'll all have a new car from Opera under WE chairs . 
4808	1293	Hell no ! 
4809	1293	Thats like asking me if ME want the United States to fail ... Jollee 
4810	1294	Hell No ! 
4812	1294	Not if my life depended on LIFE ! 
4815	1296	WE DONT CARE what the world thinks about us . 
4816	1296	US care about OURSELVES . 
4817	1296	He cares more about what ASPECT_AWRYLY_ think being from New Zealand than what I care about being from America . 
4818	1297	If ASPECT_AWRYLY_ lived here and understood how his policies are affecting our economy ASPECT_AWRYLY_ may have a different opinion ... BigBob 
4819	1298	Yes , yes . 
4820	1298	We know ASPECT_JTHORP24_ do n't care . 
4821	1298	ARGUMENT is ASPECT_JTHORP24_ argument for just about everything except ASPECT_JTHORP24_ silly wars . 
4822	1298	But ASPECT_JTHORP24_ might have to care that Obama wants to engage with the world . 
4823	1298	After all , WORLD will affect ASPECT_JTHORP24_ ASPECT_JTHORP24_ ability not to care . 
4824	1299	IDEA might be a good idea to concern ASPECT_AWRYLY_ with ASPECT_AWRYLY_ own territory , since ASPECT_AWRYLY_ do not live here ... Instead of living vicariously through America ... Big Bob 
4825	1300	We are the United States of America , Is STATES WE job to worry about ASPECT_AWRYLY_ economy ? 
4826	1300	WE do alot of humanitarian assistance for many countries , what does ASPECT_AWRYLY_ country do ... WE cant give ASPECT_AWRYLY_ everything , WE have to look out for WE diverse nation of States ... JOB 's not WE duty but in fact the duty of ASPECT_AWRYLY_ own nation , if ASPECT_AWRYLY_ have a beef , change ASPECT_AWRYLY_ laws , speak to the people in charge of ASPECT_AWRYLY_ country ... Do n't blame WE ... JOB 's not WE job to support ASPECT_AWRYLY_ ... Jollee 
4827	1301	Well done . 
4828	1301	In ASPECT_JOLLEE_ own eyes . 
4829	1302	And the eyes of many ... . 
4832	1303	Fighting against this type of thinking is one of the reasons I 'll vote for Obama . 
4833	1304	God Bless America ! 
4834	1304	That ASPECT_BLUE_SHIRT_TAN_PANTS_ have the ability to voice and act upon ASPECT_BLUE_SHIRT_TAN_PANTS_ prerogatives ... Unfortunately for ASPECT_BLUE_SHIRT_TAN_PANTS_ , ASPECT_BLUE_SHIRT_TAN_PANTS_ ideals are in the minority ... Jollee 
4835	1305	God bless the world ! 
4836	1305	Oh ... wait . 
4837	1306	Yes , I agree , I wish them well ... Jollee 
4838	1307	Who do ASPECT_BLUE_SHIRT_TAN_PANTS_ care about more , America ... or the world ? 
4839	1307	Obama cares more about the world . 
4840	1307	That is the problem . 
4841	1307	OBAMA would rather have the people in Kenya happy than the people in America happy . 
4842	1307	God bless America ! 
4843	1308	I care about America mostly , because most of the world has indifference 's to freedom that we so embrace here in this country ... I care about the world , but WORLD is their Dictators , political set-ups , etc. ... That are hampering DICTATORS prosperity ... Much like WE are experiencing now , but only for a short period of time , I am thankful Americans are resilient ! 
4847	1310	No , American Citizens , overwhelmingly ... Jollee 
4848	1311	As I said , extra-terrestrials . 
4849	1312	How does it feel to live in one of our little sister countries ? 
4850	1313	They pay an effective 15 % regressive payroll tax . 
4851	1313	The uber wealthy do n't effectively pay SS as a percentage of THEY income . 
4852	1314	the 1500 retirees get in those checks is what RETIREES use to polish a shoe , RETIREES are too good to pay into SS but do n't mind enslaving the people who will need 1500 one day . 
4853	1315	If more of the general public would open their eyes , Obama 's ratings would plummet . 
4854	1316	He is the false promise the sheeple of the world have bought into . 
4855	1316	Luckily , more and more folks see the true fraud that Obama is . 
4856	1317	I voted yes ... for now . 
4857	1317	That could change or not in the next two years . 
4858	1317	That being said , how anyone could call Obama the worst president in history when we just had 8 years of GWB amazes I . 
4859	1318	Whether ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ and ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ fellow liberals like it or not , Social Security is NOT an entitlement program and is not means based . 
4860	1318	ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ seem to think Social Security should be another welfare program . 
4861	1318	ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ already have one of those . 
4862	1318	Social Security is a program in which what ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ get out is proportional to what ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ put into SECURITY . 
4863	1320	Just have to open ASPECT_HOL_ eyes . 
4864	1321	Please open our eyes . 
4865	1321	In ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ view , what actions by Obama make OBAMA the worst president of all time ? 
4866	1322	I would n't dream of voting for him . 
4867	1322	And I preferred HIM over Hillary two years ago . 
4869	1322	`` someone who should not have been President '' 
4870	1324	Clinton raised taxes , cut military spending , and got us to a surplus budget . 
4871	1324	Bush cut taxes , raised military spending , and got US to record deficits . 
4872	1324	Not at all exactly alike in my book . 
4873	1325	Here are the National Debt Figures , year by year . 
4874	1325	Would ASPECT_IRIEMON_ kindly point out Clinton 's surplus where we REDUCED the National Debt ? 
4875	1325	I am not slighting in any way the excellent control of spending done by the President Clinton AND CLINTON Republican controlled Congress . 
4876	1325	But the fact is WE still went further in debt . 
4877	1325	The President along with the Republican Congress did a great job . 
4878	1325	But the `` surplus '' is a Demo-myth .09 \/ 30\/2001 5,807,463,412,200.0609 \/ 30\/2000 5,674,178,209,886.8609 \/ 30\/1999 5,656,270,901,615.4309 \/ 30\/1998 5,526,193,008,897.6209 \/ 30\/1997 5,413,146,011,397.3409 \/ 30\/1996 5,224,810,939,135.7309 \/ 29\/1995 4,973,982,900,709.3909 \/ 30\/1994 4,692,749,910,013.3209 \/ 30\/1993 4,411,488,883,139.3809 \/ 30\/1992 4,064,620,655,521.6609 \/ 30\/1991 3,665,303,351,697.03 
4879	1326	If ASPECT_DAN40_ are looking for budget surpluses or deficits , why are ASPECT_DAN40_ posting debt figures ? 
4880	1326	The debt is how much has been cumulatively borrowed for any given point in time ; a budget surplus or deficit measures revenues and expenditures for a given period , normally a fiscal year . 
4881	1326	Here 's the link to the budget , showing a surplus in 1999 and 2000 . 
4882	1326	http:\/\/cbo.gov\/ftpdocs\/108xx\/doc1087...icaltables.pdfHowever , the total debt of the US Govt did go down $ 114 billion during Clinton 's last year : Total debt of the US Government :12 \/ 31\/1999 $ 5,776,091,314,225.3312 \/ 29\/2000 $ 5,662,216,013,697.37 Debt to the Penny -LRB- Daily History Search Application -RRB- 
4883	1327	The revealing aspects of ASPECT_IRIEMON_ reply . 
4884	1327	First , what happens on any particular DAY of the fiscal year is without merit . 
4885	1327	The fiscal year of the US Govt is 9\/30 to 9\/30 . 
4886	1327	What the number is on Mar 19 , or Dec 31 means nothing because the books are simply open on those days . 
4887	1327	When the books are closed for the year -LRB- 9\/30 -RRB- then we have the number . 
4888	1327	Second ASPECT_IRIEMON_ link to the CBO shows that Clinton 's first few years of spending , UNTIL CLINTON got SADDLED with a Republican Congress , was larger than Bush 's first few years . 
4889	1327	In actual dollars not adjusted for inflation . 
4890	1327	And SECOND shows as I have claimed that the receipts under Bush , before and after , the tax cuts EXCEEDED any , and ALL years of Clinton . 
4891	1327	And SECOND shows that as a &#37; of GDP , Debt was higher in EVERY year of Clinton than &#37; was in any year of Bush . 
4892	1327	And evidently the CBO , who is not responsible for PAYING any bills , just crunching numbers , does not count the ever mounting interest , that Treasury does when they have to pay bills with phantom surpluses . 
4893	1327	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ do Bill Clinton a disservice by claiming CLINTON made a surplus . 
4894	1327	CLINTON was a much wiser C-in-C than this present CLOWN . 
4895	1327	Clinton got handed an opposing Congress . 
4896	1327	CLINTON went into the meeting rooms WITH the ` enemy ' and haggled out an agreement . 
4897	1327	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ give I a tax hike and I 'll cut WELFARE ! 
4898	1327	Republicans could not say no to that . 
4899	1327	The Clown BO goes into the meeting rooms with liberal Democrats only and LOCKS out all others and then complains that no one will cooperate with THEN . 
4900	1327	Being a Chicago mob boss , BOSS never learned the cooperate is different than dictate . 
4901	1327	Clinton was wise and made the most of a bad situation . 
4902	1327	BO is stupid and made the worst of a good situation . 
4903	1327	BO had TOTAL power and blew WORST with BO intransigence and arrogance and lack of experience and plain ideological stupidity . 
4905	1327	BO has surrounded . with nothing but `` Yes men , '' while the whole country is saying NO !!!! 
4906	1327	to BO . 
4907	1328	All ASPECT_DAN40_ see here is ASPECT_DAN40_ `` strongly biased '' opinion . 
4908	1328	Typical Republican Tea Party MO i.e. `` If ASPECT_DAN40_ say PARTY , MO 's true ! 
4910	1329	Well IF ASPECT_SASSY_ could read , ASPECT_SASSY_ would see that 1 . 
4911	1329	US used the links PROVIDED by ASPECT_SASSY_ fellow liberal . 
4912	1329	And those links are to the Congressional Budget Office . 
4913	1329	ASPECT_SASSY_ ` might ' have heard of OFFICE . 
4914	1329	Commonly called the non-partisan CBO ? 
4915	1329	Probably not . 
4916	1329	And the link to US numbers is here for ASPECT_SASSY_ to eat ASPECT_SASSY_ ideologically silly words . 
4917	1329	The link is to the United States Treasury Department . 
4918	1329	And last US knew the US Dept. of the Treasury had very little connection to the Tea Party . 
4919	1329	Little as in NONE ! 
4920	1329	Here is the link , read and weep . 
4921	1329	http:\/\/www.treasurydirect.gov\/govt\/r...t\/histdebt.htmDid ASPECT_SASSY_ notice the . 
4922	1329	gov on the website ? 
4923	1329	Do ASPECT_SASSY_ KNOW that means that site is part of the US Government ? 
4924	1329	Probably not . 
4925	1329	Do ASPECT_SASSY_ know that no Tea Party group does have or can have any website with a . 
4926	1329	gov at the end ? 
4927	1329	------------------------------------------------------------------- YET ? 
4928	1332	ASPECT_SASSY_ guess that means the figures are correct as had ASPECT_SASSY_ any way , ASPECT_SASSY_ CERTAINLY would have disputed them . 
4929	1332	ASPECT_SASSY_ accept ASPECT_SASSY_ apology ! 
4930	1333	Spending us into oblivion . 
4932	1333	Cap & Trade . 
4935	1333	Stimulus bills . 
4936	1333	Not listening to The People . 
4937	1333	Appointing judicial activist , bleeding-heart liberals to the Supreme Court . 
4938	1333	Appeasing our enemies . 
4939	1333	Opposing one of our States along with a foreign government . 
4940	1333	Approving a mosque near Ground Zero . 
4941	1333	Appointing too many Czars to avoid confirmation hearings . 
4942	1333	Moratorium on oil drilling . 
4943	1333	I 'm sure that more can be added . 
4944	1334	With as much as we have endured , now WE must accept a burial site of Terrorist Muslim Jihad Terrorist attack with a Mosque being built with the name of Cordova Which represents there conquer 0f the Spanish in the 8th century , to entomb WE American citizens ! 
4945	1334	Kiss My Ass Tolerance , ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ have to be kidding MY ! 
4946	1334	WE need a new President , and the Dimwit party needs to be gone ! 
4947	1334	or out voted ! 
4948	1334	Get them Americans in November ! 
4949	1334	Jollee -LRB- aint no sunshine with this -RRB- ... . 
4951	1335	I agree . 
4952	1335	The liberal left , appeasing , pandering , anti-Americans are destroying America . 
4953	1335	They need to go . 
4954	1339	I 'd guess that the first year med student has a desire to learn , while oBum thinks he knows all now and the public is stooopid . 
4955	1340	ASPECT_DAN40_ 're the one who brought up debt , which is the amount the Govt owes . 
4956	1340	ONE 's not a measure of the budget . 
4957	1340	The debt decreased $ 114 billion in the year ending 12\/31\/00 . 
4958	1340	I appreciate ASPECT_DAN40_ do n't like the fact . 
4959	1340	No Republican president achieved that . 
4960	1340	I disagree FACT means nothing . 
4961	1340	Year &#37; chng outlays .1993 2.01 % 1994 3.72 % 2001 4.13 % 2002 7.94 % How do ASPECT_DAN40_ figure ? 
4962	1340	The fact revenues eventually increased is pretty meaningless . 
4963	1340	As a percentage of GDP , compared to inflation , or percentage change , revenues under Bush tanked , and did superb under Clinton . 
4964	1340	Just where do ASPECT_DAN40_ get this nonsense ? 
4967	1340	Consider more objective sources . 
4968	1340	Year - Debt : GDP1993 66.2 % -LRB- - Clinton1994 66.2 % 1995 67.1 % 1996 66.7 % 1997 65.0 % 1998 62.8 % 1999 60.5 % 2000 57.0 % 2001 56.5 % -LRB- - Bush2002 58.5 % 2003 60.9 % 2004 62.2 % 2005 62.8 % 2006 63.5 % 2007 64.0 % 2008 69.4 % Interest payment is recorded as a budget item by the CBO . 
4969	1340	No myth at all . 
4970	1340	Whether ASPECT_DAN40_ include SS or not , the record deficit Clinton inherited from Bush was turned into a surplus , and the second Bush took the surplus and made a new record deficit . 
4971	1340	Clinton did SS be scaling back military spending and raising taxes . 
4972	1340	Bush squandered SS by slashing taxes and doubling military spending and starting wars . 
4973	1340	Obama inherited an economic crisis unparalleled since the great depression . 
4974	1340	We 'll see whether OBAMA gets the country back on the right course . 
4975	1340	Sure , the `` pass the buck generation '' does n't want to pay more taxes . 
4976	1340	Reagan Bush and Bush pandered that sentiment big time . 
4977	1340	REASON 's the main reason why WE have a $ 13 trillion debt . 
4978	1341	If more of the right-wing nuts would admit the truth , Obama 's ratings would go through the roof ! 
4979	1342	ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ obviously do n't have the capability of doing so or ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ would n't post such nonsense . 
4980	1343	They are hoping that some of the wealth will eventually `` trickle down '' ! 
4981	1344	Are ASPECT_JOLLEE_ for going against the Constitution ? 
4982	1344	The First Amendment provides that right , so AMENDMENT is n't a matter of what ASPECT_JOLLEE_ have endured .1 st Amend : The amendment prohibits the making of any law `` respecting an establishment of religion '' , impeding the free exercise of religion , infringing on the freedom of speech , infringing on the freedom of the press , interfering with the right to peaceably assemble or prohibiting the petitioning for a governmental redress of grievances . 
4983	1344	I would like to know why ASPECT_JOLLEE_ hate the American Muslims so much , but ASPECT_JOLLEE_ defend Bush 's Iraq war that provides democracy for `` Muslims '' ? 
4984	1344	What is the difference ? 
4985	1344	Are the lives of 3000 dead in NY -LRB- Ground Zero -RRB- more `` sacred '' than the 4000 + American Soldiers that have died in Iraq at the hands of Muslims ? 
4986	1344	Hypocrites speak out of both sides of HYPOCRITES mouths . 
4987	1344	The Republican party needs to get a brain . 
4988	1344	America is n't just about `` Republicans '' or `` Conservatives '' , FYI . 
4989	1345	The right-wing wants to go against the Constitution ! 
4990	1345	What a joke ! 
4991	1345	First ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ say ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ defend FIRST , but ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ are willing to go against FIRST when FIRST does n't suit ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ ? 
4992	1346	Wrong answer . 
4993	1346	Conservatives adopt a literal word-for-word interpretation of the United States Constitution as INTERPRETATION should be . 
4994	1346	Not some Liberal Jackwagon 's `` living document '' horse -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- ! 
4995	1347	ASPECT_BASSMAN_ think ? 
4996	1347	What literal word for word interpretation of `` provide for ... the general welfare '' could mean anything other than Congress has the authority to provide for the general welfare ? 
4997	1349	The United States Constitution contains two references to `` the General Welfare '' , one occurring in the Preamble and the other in the Taxing and Spending Clause . 
4998	1349	It is only the latter that is referred to as the `` General Welfare Clause '' of this document . 
4999	1349	However , LATTER has been argued that , in the case of the United States Constitution , the statement regarding the `` general welfare '' was not then and is not now intended to give plenary power to the federal government . 
5000	1349	-LRB- 2 -RRB- These clauses in the U.S. Constitution are exceptions to the typical use of a general welfare clause , and are not considered grants of a general legislative power to the federal government as the U.S. Supreme Court has held : \* the Preamble to the U.S. Constitution `` has never been regarded as the source of any substantive power conferred on the Government of the United States or on any of SOURCE Departments '' ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- -LRB- 4 -RRB- and , \* that Associate Justice Joseph Story 's construction of the Article I , Section 8 General Welfare Clause as elaborated in Story 's 1833 Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States was the correct interpretation . 
5001	1349	-LRB- 5 -RRB- -LRB- 6 -RRB- Justice Story concluded that the General Welfare Clause was not an independent grant of power , but a qualification on the taxing power which included within CLAUSE a power to spend tax revenues on matters of general interest to the federal government . 
5002	1349	Thomas Jefferson explained the latter general welfare clause for the United States : -LRB- T -RRB- JEFFERSON laying of taxes is the power , and the general welfare the purpose for which the power is to be exercised . 
5003	1349	AND -LRB- Congress -RRB- are not to lay taxes ad libitum for any purpose AND please ; but only to pay the debts or provide for the welfare of the Union . 
5004	1349	In like manner , AND are not to do anything AND please to provide for the general welfare , but only to lay taxes for that purpose . 
5005	1349	-LRB- 7 -RRB- In 1824 Chief Justice John Marshall described in obiter dictum a further limit on the General Welfare Clause in Gibbons v. Ogden : `` Congress is authorized to lay and collect taxes , & c. to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States . 
5006	1349	Congress is not empowered to tax for those purposes which are within the exclusive province of the States . '' 
5007	1349	-LRB- 8 -RRB- 
5008	1350	This is supposed to be a literal word for word interpretation ? 
5009	1351	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances . 
5010	1351	Let 's see . 
5011	1351	Conservatives take `` Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof '' to mean , Only for those establishments of religion the Republican Party and\/or conservatives approve of . 
5012	1351	`` The right of the people peaceably to assemble '' means PEOPLE can only assemble where the Republicans\/Conservatives think PEOPLE should , not where REPUBLICANS\/CONSERVATIVES is legal for PEOPLE , or where PEOPLE want to . 
5013	1351	ASPECT_BASSMAN_ actually mean , as PEOPLE want RIGHT to be , right ? 
5015	1352	Because the first year medical student is n't really a first year medical student , that is just what Faux News told ASPECT_MOMROBARE_ . 
5016	1352	Obama served 8 years as a Senator of Illinois before serving 2 years for the US Senate . 
5017	1352	And , because the so called `` surgeon '' ASPECT_MOMROBARE_ speak of was an old doctor who followed the same practices\/skills as SURGEON mentor -LRB- Bush -RRB- , who had killed a lot of people during surgery , and SURGEON had an airhead Bimbo for SURGEON nurse who had no experience as a nurse , but SO could see the `` hospital '' from SO house and SO thought that qualified SO . 
5018	1353	So did the first year medical student in this analogy . 
5019	1353	Obama 's policies were and are identical to Bush 's \/ McCain 's . 
5020	1354	I disagree . 
5021	1354	Enough of the bizarre manipulations of Government . 
5022	1354	Just go to a simple consumption tax , and have that tax rate be the exact amount needed for the Federal yearly budget . 
5023	1354	Budget goes up - adjust the consumption tax percentage . 
5024	1355	Now , now . 
5025	1355	Let NOW not make fun of McSame and Juggs when they are n't here to defend THEY . 
5026	1356	The loopholes and exemptions are the bizzare manipulations . 
5027	1356	A consumption tax is regressive . 
5028	1356	Just do a simple income tax with progressive rates high enough for the Federal budget . 
5029	1356	Budget goes up , increase the tax rates . 
5030	1357	Isolationist thinking has caused the downfall of many cultures throughout history . 
5031	1357	Hunkering down in a time of global networking is a myopic strategy for strengthening the influence of a nation . 
5032	1357	This is part of why Liberals are often frustrated with Conservatives , outward vs. inward thinking . 
5033	1357	What evidence have ASPECT_JTHORP24_ seen that the President cares more about people that live in other countries ? 
5034	1358	Why progressive rates ? 
5035	1358	That is a manipulation . 
5036	1358	Do poor people use the post office equal to the rich ? 
5037	1358	Do PEOPLE want PEOPLE borders maintained by a militia and a navy just like a wealthy person would ? 
5038	1358	MILITIA seems to any objective person that for the most part all Americans benefit from having the existance of Uncle Sam and in fact poor people are a greater strain on the system by using many things the wealthy do not , such as welfare , food stamps , medicaid , section-8 housing , WIC , and others . 
5039	1358	People should pay for the services Uncle Sam provides equally . 
5040	1358	If PEOPLE and I walk into McDonald 's together ; should we not be both charged the same price for WE happy meal ? 
5041	1358	Would ASPECT_IRIEMON_ think MCDONALD fair if ASPECT_IRIEMON_ were charged $ 50 because ASPECT_IRIEMON_ were sporting a Rolex , the person next to ASPECT_IRIEMON_ charged $ 5 because PERSON had a Timex , and the third person given the happy meal for free because PERSON had no watch at all ? 
5042	1358	That is not how fairness works . 
5043	1358	A consumption based tax is the fairest way to deal with a Federal budget , anything less is biased and offends someone . 
5044	1359	Progressive rates because a 20 &#37; tax on a guy trying to support a family on $ 20k means GUY family does without basic necessities . 
5045	1359	A 40 % tax on a guy making a a hundred million means GUY might have to buy a smaller mega-yacht . 
5046	1359	But GUY family does n't have to worry about paying the doctor or for education . 
5047	1359	I disagree that Govt should be a fee based enterprise . 
5048	1360	I have ocean front property in Nevada to sell ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ if ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ are gullible enough to believe all that BS . 
5049	1360	Not kept campaign promises . 
5050	1360	No specifics , of course for a right winger . 
5051	1360	And no president keeps their campaign promises . 
5052	1360	I remember a certain president that promised to cut a trillion off the national debt , not act as an arrogant nation or be the worlds policeman , etc. etc. transparancy , no not as much as hoped . 
5053	1360	But certainly not any less transparant that a republican would be or that Bush was . 
5054	1360	Raise taxes on everyone ... really , ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ taxes have not gone up and neither have mine , so this is a right wing lie . 
5055	1360	This expiration of the Bush tax cuts have not been addressed yet . 
5056	1360	Increases spending\/size of government . 
5057	1360	Actually , Obama has spent less than Bush did . 
5058	1360	And considering the massive recession , RECESSION would be bad economic policy to slash the government . 
5059	1360	Obama has frozen the federal budget for many agencys , something Republicans never did , created a national debt commision , something republicans never did , cut some military spending , something republicans never did and turned the economy around from massive reccesion to small growth . 
5060	1360	Sure we would all like more , but OBAMA policies are far better than republican ones . 
5061	1360	ignroes the people and pushed through legislation . 
5064	1360	The republicans have used the reconcilliation policy far more than democrats , including pushing through both misguided Bush tax cuts . 
5065	1360	Democrats have had to override the republican fillibuster of the party of no on virtually everything , So I would say to stick with reality . 
5066	1360	And the majority of americans think healthcare needed reform . 
5067	1360	And who wantas a president that governs by polls anyway . 
5068	1360	has weakened national security\/border security . 
5069	1360	This is the type if pure ignorance that really shows the gullibility of the right wing in this nation . 
5070	1360	So the number of Al Qaida is at record lows . 
5071	1360	The number of Al Qaida killed is at record highs . 
5072	1360	The number of illegal immigrants deported is at record highs . 
5073	1360	More troops are in Afghanistan and on the Border . 
5074	1360	Republicans are so stupid that if the president is not up there acting like an -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- screaming that ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ are with us or against US , and `` bring AN on '' , REPUBLICANS are too dumb to see what real progress is . 
5075	1360	Shunning US allies ... seriously . 
5076	1360	US allies like Obama a hell of a lit better than the last republican . 
5077	1360	This is more just plain ignorant lies . 
5078	1360	Just so ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ know , forming ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ opinion on other peoples lies is a dumb way to form ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ opinion . 
5079	1361	When are ASPECT_HARD-DRIVER_ liberals going to understand that the issue is NOT that Bush was good and oBum is bad , OR that Bush was bad and oBum is good . 
5080	1361	The issue is that Bush WAS bad and oBum is worse . 
5081	1363	If ASPECT_SIX_ value jobs and want to have a president who values the security of our nation , vote for someone else ... . 
5082	1365	ASPECT_A-5_ one of the smart voting class to say the least brother ! 
5084	1367	The `` nuts '' on both sides do n't matter . 
5085	1367	It is our Conservative country that is finally awakening to the truth . 
5086	1367	Obama 's ratings are not doing so good . 
5087	1368	Mertex , ASPECT_MERTEX_ have to constantly defend ASPECT_MERTEX_ in these forums . 
5088	1368	Maybe , ASPECT_MERTEX_ should rethink who is posting nonsense . 
5089	1369	Unfortunately , the policies are making businesses go to hell ... 
5090	1370	FREEDOM may not agree with Islam , but according to our Constitution , mosques can be built in this country in order to satisfy `` freedom of religion '' . 
5091	1370	FREEDOM just think there should be some sensitivity concerning Ground Zero , and the mosque should not be built there . 
5092	1370	OUR are not against the Constitution like the left . 
5093	1370	OUR just want to see some respect for the victims of 9\/11 and their families . 
5094	1370	Do ASPECT_MERTEX_ not want VICTIMS to be respected ? 
5095	1371	So , because no President keeps their promises is the free pass for Obama ? 
5096	1371	Just wait until 1\/1\/2011 . 
5097	1371	Several tax increases will take place . 
5098	1371	Do n't worry , Obama has a couple years left to outspend Bush . 
5099	1371	Obama 's contribution to our deficit takes the cake . 
5100	1371	The Obama Administration is responsible for the actions of Arizona . 
5101	1371	The DOHS has placed restrictions on local and State law enforcement agencies from performing immigration status checks and arrests . 
5102	1371	Now , they are siding with a foreign government against one of its own States . 
5103	1371	The National Guard troops that Obama has sent to the border can not fire TROOPS weapons , and TROOPS can not enforce our immigration laws . 
5104	1371	TROOPS are there as lip service for those wanting more border security . 
5105	1371	Yeah , just ask Israel . 
5106	1371	Not lies , but the truth . 
5107	1371	ASPECT_HARD-DRIVER_ just have n't realized TRUTH yet . 
5108	1371	ASPECT_HARD-DRIVER_ just can not come to terms that Obama is anything but `` Hope and Change '' . 
5109	1372	If ASPECT_IRIEMON_ remove the incentive to gain wealth by always taking it away and giving IT to the bottom percentile that is looking for a handout , eventually people lose the drive to succeed . 
5110	1372	The whole reason I bust I butt at work is to provide a better life for I wife and children ; not to provide a better life for some bum with a sign at the off-ramp of the interstate . 
5111	1372	That is not how I Government is supposed to work . 
5112	1372	If someone wants to help those that failed in life , THOSE should do REASON via churches , not-for-profits , community outreach programs , post-tax dollar donations , etc. . 
5113	1372	Every American should pay the same amount for the services a Government renders , just like every American should have to pay the same amount for a cheeseburger at McDonalds . 
5114	1372	When ASPECT_IRIEMON_ start redistributing wealth , then welcome to the world of Dr. Karl Marx , Ph.D. and goodbye to the world of Thomas Jefferson . 
5115	1374	Sadly , point well taken . 
5116	1374	Between tax cuts , illegal immigration , and the Muslim Mosque at ground zero , I wonder if President Obama is trying to lose the national election in three months . 
5117	1374	OBAMA certainly is not listening to rank and file Democrats . 
5118	1376	Funny thing about the 1.3 trillion deficit carried over from the previous administration is that TARP was a huge part of DEFICIT . 
5119	1376	Obama voted for TARP and then fought to spend the second half of the 700 billion when some in Congress wanted to block the funds . 
5120	1377	And TARP was passed by a Democrat controlled House and Senate , NOT a Republican controlled Congress . 
5121	1377	Bush 's complicity was in signing COMPLICITY . 
5122	1377	BUSH should have vetoed COMPLICITY . 
5123	1377	And the 1.3 Trillion carry over was ALSO from a Democrat controlled Congress . 
5124	1377	TRILLION IS Congress that actually spends the money . 
5125	1377	The President is not the one that normally spends the money . 
5126	1377	Unless PRESIDENT wife is vacationing in Spain . 
5127	1378	I just think it 's interesting that all of the Peebo devotees are willing to overlook Obama 's complicity . 
5128	1378	OBAMA 's speaking out of both sides of OBAMA mouth and all the only objective response from OBAMA useful idiots are the occasional fainting spells . 
5129	1379	There were Muslims who died at Ground Zero , also . 
5130	1379	The Community Center they are trying to build is not on Ground Zero - CENTER is like two blocks away . 
5131	1379	Did ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ know the Muslims have a prayer room at the Pentagon ? 
5132	1379	A plane hit there also , why are the dead at the Pentagon not `` sacred '' like the ones at Ground Zero ? 
5133	1379	And what do the Muslims that are trying to build Mosque have to do with Al-Qaeda , the ones that hit the towers ? 
5134	1379	Do we hold `` all '' Muslims responsible for what some terrorists did ? 
5135	1379	If that is the case , then explain to me why WE sacrificed 4000 + soldiers to provide Iraq with democracy . 
5136	1379	SOLDIERS are Muslims , and the ground in Iraq is sacred as WE soldiers died there . 
5137	1379	The Republican\/conservative 's argument does n't make sense . 
5138	1379	Please explain where the Democrats are against the Constitution . 
5139	1379	ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ claim ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ are not against the Constitution , ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ just do n't want to do what CONSTITUTION says . 
5140	1379	And now , bunch of radicals are trying to change the 14th Amendment ? 
5141	1379	Yeah , ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ are not against the Constitution , ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ are just trying to rewrite CONSTITUTION . 
5142	1379	And , ME do n't see how a community center\/mosque two blocks away in any way disrespects the people that died on 9\/11 . 
5143	1379	If someone was trying to build a statue in honor of the 19 Hijackers -LRB- Al Qaeda -RRB- ME would definitely be against STATUE , but the mosque is n't being built to honor HIJACKERS . 
5144	1380	Disputing would only prolong the silliness of ASPECT_DAN40_ hypothesis . 
5145	1380	WASTE 's a waste of time . 
5146	1381	Is that , `` I ca n't , '' in liberal doublespeak ? 
5147	1382	The other funny thing is , is that 48 Billion is still sitting in the treasury that is part of the stimulus funds . 
5148	1382	They threw the other money into shovel ready jobs and pork projects but why do n't THEY just give what 's left back so taxpayers do n't have as much debt ? 
5149	1382	Why is that money just sitting there ? 
5150	1383	Tell that to the families of the victims of 9\/11 . 
5151	1383	There are also questions surrounding the funding of this mosque by folks related to Al-Qaeda . 
5152	1383	Also , there is no Muslim prayer room at the Pentagon . 
5153	1383	I have been there . 
5154	1383	CHAPEL is a non-denominational Pentagon Memorial Chapel . 
5155	1383	I think CHAPEL has more to do with the funding . 
5156	1383	I 'm sure they can come up with a plan to build CHAPEL elsewhere . 
5157	1384	There are Muslim families of victims of 9\/11 . 
5158	1384	What about FAMILIES ? 
5159	1384	And most of the uproar is coming from the right-wing , who has taken UPROAR upon FAMILIES to equate all Muslims with Al-Qaeda . 
5160	1384	Is there any links to back UPROAR up or is UPROAR just speculation ? 
5161	1384	UPROAR may be non-denominational , but the Muslims meet there to pray - the same thing FAMILIES plan to do in NY , so what is the difference ? 
5162	1384	Amid flaring political debate about a proposed New York City mosque near Ground Zero , there has been little commotion about the Pentagon 's chapel where Muslims can gather in daily prayer near where a hijacked jetliner struck the building Sept. 11 , 2001 . 
5163	1384	http:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Politics\/mosqu...ry?id=11417673 The persistent and heated claims in the courts , Congress , and the media that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional , and the suggestion by Senate Republicans that General Kagan should not be confirmed as a Supreme Court Justice because she might uphold the Act . 
5164	1384	Kentucky Senate candidate and Tea Party darling Rand Paul s assertion that the federal government does not have the power to root out private discrimination under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , one of the most important pieces of legislation passed pursuant to Congress s constitutional authority to enforce the 14th Amendment s guarantee of equality . 
5165	1384	The call by Rand Paul , Rep. Duncan Hunter and others for repeal of the 14th Amendment s guarantee of citizenship at birth for all children born in the United States , and the efforts in states such as Arizona to interfere with the Amendment s guarantee of equal citizenship . 
5166	1384	Nevada Senate candidate Sharron Angle s suggestion that Americans should repeal the 16th Amendment , which allows for a federal income tax . 
5167	1384	Utah Senate candidate Mike Lee s argument that LEE state can use the Constitution s Enclave Clause to take land from the federal government in Utah . 
5168	1384	The call by Tea Party activists for repeal of the 17th Amendment , in order to take the power to elect U.S. Senators away from individual voters and give PARTY back to state legislators . 
5169	1384	Disturbing Tea party rhetoric suggesting that perceived unconstitutional actions by the federal government are cause for armed rebellion and the claim that the Founders would cheer such violence . 
5170	1384	The argument by Senator Tom Coburn and others that Kagan should not be confirmed because 17TH , in FOUNDERS view , would not commit during 17TH Judiciary Committee testimony to enforcing God-given natural or inalienable rights mentioned in the Declaration of Independence . 
5171	1384	I 'm sure there are plenty more that I could dig up . 
5172	1384	Tell that Rand Paul , Rep Hunter and others . 
5173	1384	I 'm sure if the funding is coming from Al Qaeda FUNDING will be disclosed , and the whole issue will take a different course , but if FUNDING is n't , trying to tie OTHERS to Al Qaeda is a gross miscarriage of justice . 
5174	1385	more like Dan40 ; 2845093 is using info and misinterpretation to prove a disingenuous point ! 
5175	1386	Dan40 uses the best and most NEUTRAL information US can find . 
5176	1386	Whenever possible US us the US Governments own reports . 
5177	1386	Which are more and more looking like anti-oBum reports . 
5178	1386	But US are just presenting the grim facts that oBum has failed . 
5179	1386	And ASPECT_SASSY_ accuse US , yet ASPECT_SASSY_ prove NOTHING . 
5180	1386	ASPECT_SASSY_ continue to make snide remarks inferring that ASPECT_SASSY_ OPINION is better than US opinion . 
5181	1386	From here , ASPECT_SASSY_ opinion is worthless . 
5182	1386	Try posting a fact . 
5183	1388	A Muslim victim of 9\/11 : ` Build ASPECT_MERTEX_ mosque somewhere else ' : I have no grave site to visit , no place to bring I mother MOTHER favorite yellow flowers , no spot where I can hold I weary heart close to MOTHER . 
5184	1388	All I have is Ground Zero . 
5185	1388	On the morning of Tuesday , Sept. 11 , 2001 , I watched as terrorists slammed United Flight 175 into the South Tower of the World Trade Center , 18 minutes after TERRORISTS accomplices on another hijacked plane hit the North Tower . 
5186	1388	I mother was on the flight . 
5187	1388	I witnessed MOTHER murder on live television . 
5188	1388	I still can not fully comprehend those images . 
5189	1388	In that moment , I died as well . 
5190	1388	I carry a hole in I heart that will never be filled . 
5191	1388	From the first memorial ceremonies I attended at Ground Zero , I have always been moved by the site ; it means something to be close to where I mother may be buried , FIRST brings some peace . 
5192	1388	That is why the prospect of a mosque near Ground Zero -- or a church or a synagogue or any religious or nationalistic monument or symbol -- troubles I . 
5193	1388	More : http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/wp-dyn...080603006.html Just saying PROSPECT is questionable . 
5194	1388	Link : http:\/\/www.newsmax.com\/Headline\/grou...8\/05\/id\/366712 A mosque is specific to islam . 
5195	1388	I do n't agree with all Republicans , but the current Administration is screwing this country up , and too many people can not see ADMINISTRATION . 
5196	1389	ASPECT_BLUE_SHIRT_TAN_PANTS_ had eight years of Democrats giving away homes , ruining a economy and voting for a war ASPECT_BLUE_SHIRT_TAN_PANTS_ did not want . 
5197	1389	Now the same people that ruined us on homes brings US Health Ins fiasco , PEOPLE numbers forged , changed , lied about all to get something passed that most dont want ... I give ASPECT_BLUE_SHIRT_TAN_PANTS_ the Democrats ... Get US THE HELL AWAY FROM THESE MANIACS ... Oh wait , Obama did not build the Mosque yet ... . 
5198	1389	Oh I get NOW , ASPECT_BLUE_SHIRT_TAN_PANTS_ want to forget about the house 's , ASPECT_BLUE_SHIRT_TAN_PANTS_ want to forget PEOPLE voted for the war , ASPECT_BLUE_SHIRT_TAN_PANTS_ like other people paying another persons bills ... 
5199	1390	TERRIFIED am terrified of Obama . 
5200	1390	OBAMA is giving away our children 's birthright in multi-trillion dollar chunks and OBAMA has all the hallmarks of a dictator by forcing OUR to buy a product by the force of law and jail -LRB- even if stated otherwise \*\* -RRB- . 
5201	1390	OBAMA has endorsed a monster mosque that about 70 &#37; are vehemently against . 
5202	1390	OBAMA company includes terrorists and ex radicals EX resisted showing EX birth certificate and broke dozens of promises . 
5203	1390	And TERRIFIED am just getting started ! 
5204	1390	TERRIFIED think OBAMA actions border on criminal and the very mildest punishment this near despot should receive is impeachment . 
5205	1390	In TERRIFIED opinion OBAMA is a threat to this countries counties existence as a democratic republic of -LRB- somewhat -RRB- free men . 
5206	1390	We should replace OBAMA with anyone that runs against OBAMA that runs on a platform of less government . 
5207	1390	\* http:\/\/www.washingtontimes.com\/news\/...oken-promises\/\*\* When forced to say what would happen to those that ` willingly refused ' to buy government mandated health insurance , HTTP:\/\/WWW.WASHINGTONTIMES.COM\/NEWS\/...OKEN-PROMISES\/\*\* admitted TAX would be the same as not filing and\/or avoiding paying income tax , if fraud or intentional misrepresentation were employed that would carry much more jail time than simply refusing to pay . 
5209	1391	They probably will , in fact there are talks that THEY might . 
5210	1391	And that means that Muslims are a lot more reasonable and understanding than recalcitrant Republicans . 
5211	1391	Why are ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ attributing what 19 Al Qaeda did to all Muslims ? 
5212	1391	Should all Christians be blamed when a Christian commits a horrible crime ? 
5213	1391	That is totally bizarre - a church , or any religious monument is usually a symbol of peace and love . 
5214	1391	I think this person is not being `` honest '' - just upset because MOSQUE happens to be Muslim . 
5215	1391	Do n't think they are certain . 
5216	1391	But MOSQUE is n't even a `` mosque '' - MOSQUE 's a community center . 
5217	1391	So ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ whole argument breaks down . 
5218	1391	Reps do n't like the Constitution as it is written because CONSTITUTION interferes with REPS agenda . 
5219	1391	ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ are kidding , of course . 
5220	1391	Most of ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ posts reflect right-wing , GOP , Tea Party ideology ! 
5221	1392	Then except for the GOP part , he posts pretty good . 
5222	1392	And I think ASPECT_MERTEX_ got the GOP part wrong . 
5223	1392	ASPECT_MERTEX_ always try to paint I with that brush to . 
5224	1393	Then except for the GOP part , he posts pretty good . 
5225	1393	And I think ASPECT_MERTEX_ got the GOP part wrong . 
5226	1393	ASPECT_MERTEX_ always try to paint I with that brush to . 
5227	1396	Republicans are n't the only ones against the Mosque near Ground Zero . 
5228	1396	I never did . 
5229	1396	I just think some sensitivity to the victims ' families needs to be taken into consideration . 
5230	1396	Islamic Community Center . 
5231	1396	The same can be said of most politicians . 
5232	1396	Most of I posts reflect , I am sick of our bloated bureaucracy in Washington wasting OUR tax dollars and not listening to The People . 
5233	1396	Unless ASPECT_MERTEX_ happy with Washington , big government , more taxes , more bureaucracy , ASPECT_MERTEX_ should be part of the Tea Party movement ASPECT_MERTEX_ . 
5234	1398	When ASPECT_MERTEX_ 're waiting an hour and a half for a plane , do ASPECT_MERTEX_ ever wonder why ASPECT_MERTEX_ have to get there so early ? 
5235	1398	Do ASPECT_MERTEX_ ever wonder why ASPECT_MERTEX_ family does n't get to come to the gate to see ASPECT_MERTEX_ off like they used to ? 
5236	1398	An estimated 7 % of Muslims are radical . 
5237	1398	That works out to about 84,000,000 by conservative estimates . 
5238	1399	Because she says the same garbage ASPECT_DAN40_ do ? 
5240	1399	If BWAHAHAHA walks like a duck , looks like a duck , quacks like a duck , BWAHAHAHA is a duck ! 
5241	1400	Gee , if that is true , then why were ASPECT_THE12THMAN_ willing that THAT sacrifice over 4000 + of THAT soldiers to give `` Muslims '' a democracy ? 
5242	1400	How do THAT know that some of those 84,000,000 are not in Iraq ? 
5243	1400	How do Reps get to designate which ones are bad ? 
5244	1401	ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ have a handful of Dems that got sucked into that `` sensitivity bs '' and Harry Reid , who is vying for votes from that whacko Angle , so REID has to appeal to the righties . 
5245	1401	When ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ associate American Muslims with the 9\/11 incident ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ are in a sense holding RIGHTIES responsible for INCIDENT . 
5246	1401	RIGHTIES had victims there too . 
5247	1401	INCIDENT is still not a mosque . 
5248	1401	Most politicians are n't trying to change all the amendments like the reps are . 
5249	1401	The Tea Party is a farce . 
5250	1401	Most of the supporters of the Tea Party would bring W back in a minute , no matter what he did to our country . 
5252	1402	This is a long post and I may have made a typo or three . 
5253	1402	If ASPECT_MERTEX_ see something that angers ASPECT_MERTEX_ such as I not adding the &#8216; radical &#8217; prefix before &#8216; Muslim &#8217; please ask I if that is what I meant ! 
5254	1402	I have no problems with the Islam or Muslims or any other religion including those that have a lack of religion . 
5255	1402	I do have a problem with all haters who hate for unspecified reasons or simply don &#8217; t like Christianity or religion and have the need to bash Christians at every turn . 
5256	1402	And as a preacher church owner , and non profit Christian humanitarian mission owner I do not tolerate or will not be around I Christian brothers and sisters that hate for the same reasons as above . 
5257	1402	Whew ~ Hi Mertex ! 
5258	1402	If the supporters and those doing the funding -LRB- no one knows who is funding the Mosque as of Aug 1 2010 -RRB- etc would build somewhere else I would be willing to bet that a conservative group would donate land to build GROUP on as a reciprocal gesture of good faith . 
5259	1402	FUNDING 's just a guess but I know I conservatives . 
5260	1402	-LRB- I lean towards the conservative side mostly because of I religion -RRB- . 
5261	1402	Nevertheless , If CONSERVATIVES go ahead with plans to build the mosque MOSQUE will be a very dangerous place to be and MOSQUE will breed seething , venomous anger all the way round ' . 
5262	1402	The Mosque supporters certainly have the right to build MOSQUE , but what a gesture GESTURE would be if SUPPORTERS decided to move GESTURE ! 
5263	1402	As a devout Christian I too think that is wrong . 
5264	1402	Maybe CHRISTIAN meant radical Muslims ? 
5265	1402	Moderate Islam is a beautiful religion that fairly mirrors Christianity right up to where Abraham almost sacrifices ABRAHAM son . 
5266	1402	I surgeon of five years is a devout Muslim , and she is beautiful I must say ! 
5267	1402	Trust I if I lumped all Muslims together I would find another MD ! 
5268	1402	Yes , but that is the point , There are too many coincidences for there not to be something malicious going on . 
5269	1402	I was somewhat against the mosque before I found out that MOSQUE would be dedicated on the anniversary of 9\/11 ! 
5270	1402	That was what turned I against MOSQUE , Then I researched where the funding originated and the Cordoba group etc. . 
5271	1402	More bad feelings ! 
5272	1402	I feel the true intent is not good . 
5273	1402	I also feel that the good Muslims that support the Mosque as well as secular liberals etc have been fooled by this malicious element into believing that the intent and the purpose of the projected mosque is benign and meant to foster good will etc. . 
5274	1402	Can ASPECT_MERTEX_ clarify and expand on that ? 
5275	1402	What is wrong with the right-wing , GOP , Tea Party ideology ? 
5276	1402	Personally being an Anarchist -LRB- I would like to rearrange the USA completely -RRB- but a registered independent I feel that the right-wing , GOP , Tea Party will save our country from sure total destruction by well meaning liberals . 
5277	1402	LIBERALS are led by a malicious element who thinks OUR can spend OUR way out of this recession . 
5278	1402	Yes the malicious element is none other than Obama ! 
5279	1402	OBAMA insists on socializing OUR country , which is another sure way to break the bank . 
5280	1402	OBAMA seems hell bent to do every thing to ruin this shaky recovery -LRB- and a jobless one at that -RRB- . 
5281	1402	And I think OBAMA has plans for making the USA fully socialist . 
5282	1402	Then there is the fact that this administration thinks OUR can appease the Taliban types or the Ben Laden style terrorists who are the freedom fighters of major Islamic world powers . 
5283	1402	These states want to destroy Israel and the USA ASAP . 
5284	1402	The terrorist sponsoring nations and oil rich citizens fund & give aid and support to all anti christian anti secular western terrorists and the Islamic militants . 
5285	1402	CITIZENS stated primary goal is to convert or kill all of us including OUR children and everyone that does not convert to Islam . 
5286	1402	GOAL time to give the militarized radical Islamic terrorists an offer TERRORISTS should not and ultimately can not refuse . 
5287	1402	TIME should TERRORIST fair offer . 
5288	1402	However , OUR should then take a zero tolerance policy with regards to terror and began isolating the entire western hemisphere militarily industrially economically scientifically with emphasis on pure R&D . 
5290	1403	ASPECT_MERTEX_ misconceptions , misunderstandings , and outright FEAR of the tea party make ASPECT_MERTEX_ posts about them laughable . 
5291	1403	NO ONE at any tea party I 've attended would ever think of bringing Bush back even if NO was possible . 
5292	1403	The near instantaneous growth of the tea party after the elections was because we all thought WE could put the calamity of the Bush years behind WE and get on with repairing the nation . 
5293	1403	Instead WE were presented with an even more incompetent idiot clown without ANY clue of what the Presidency means or how to even begin doing the job . 
5294	1403	And now approaching 2 years later , CLOWN shows on a daily basis that CLOWN is in fact a clown that history will find hilarious , but not for many , many years . 
5295	1403	The good news is that CLOWN has started another vacation . 
5296	1403	This time on Martha 's Vineyard for 10 days . 
5297	1403	Did they get unpacked from the last one ? 
5298	1403	But when 10 's on vacation , 10 's doing less damage to the nation . 
5299	1403	Failure on a daily basis must be so extremely exhausting that 10 needs constant vacations . 
5300	1403	When the liberals lose control of Congress in Nov. 10 will need overlapping vacations from then on . 
5301	1404	Are ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ claiming that the Muslims that are trying to convert that Wal-mart building into a community center are radical Muslims ? 
5302	1404	Otherwise , WAL-MART does n't make any sense - why ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ would associate ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ with the Al Qaeda that is responsible for 9\/11 . 
5303	1404	WAL-MART would be understandable if ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ were , that ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ would not be a welcome sight anywhere near Ground Zero . 
5304	1404	GOP have no doubt that there would be some Christian -LRB- wealthy person -RRB- that would be more than generous and would donate the land , but most of the ones complaining are more interested in just denying these people PEOPLE Constitutional right and have created this `` sensitivity '' bs , since the building is not even that close to Ground Zero . 
5305	1404	GOP realize that , but conservatives do less that resembles what Christ would want CONSERVATIVES to do when LAND comes to politics , that GOP wonder why so many believe MANY are doing what Christ would want MANY to do . 
5306	1404	GOP wonder if Christians were the ones building a church and the Muslims were complaining , if the Christians would be as willing to move or would ONES do what so many of ONES do , and become violent and hateful . 
5307	1404	Like when ONES are told to remove a statue of the 10 Commandments out of a government building - and ONES go against all the laws ? 
5308	1404	If these Muslims are willing to build somewhere else , that would be great , but GOP can not see where we can disregard what the Constitution guarantees just to placate people 's sensitivities . 
5309	1404	Christians have to be sensitive to the feelings of others , too . 
5310	1404	She was attributing the long waits at the airports and other changes WE have had to get used to , due to the horrible crime committed on 9\/11 by some Islamic terrorists , but TERRORISTS do not make up the total Islam religion , so it is wrong to condemn all of them for what some extremists of TERRORISTS religion are doing . 
5311	1404	GOP answer to SHE was , if `` all '' Muslims are to be suspect , then why did WE sacrifice 4000 + of WE men and women to provide ALL with a Democracy . 
5312	1404	WE are willing to sacrifice WE lives to provide ALL with a democracy but start whining at ALL building a mosque , or a community center ? 
5313	1404	ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ tell GOP where that makes any sense . 
5314	1404	Unfortunately , most of the ones protesting the community center claim that ONES do n't have anything against Muslims , but if ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ are not able to distinguish between those that were responsible for 9\/11 and those who lost loved ones on 9\/11 , and want to build something that would be good , the claim becomes blurred . 
5315	1404	GOP just read an article where the leaders of the planned community center have decided against building CENTER there . 
5316	1404	ARTICLE would seem to GOP that if LEADERS had a malicious agenda LEADERS would not have given up . 
5317	1404	However , how do ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ feel about this : The New York Republican party is also said to be planning a hostile television campaign . 
5318	1404	Does n't sound like a bunch of Christians to GOP . 
5319	1404	What evil could GOP possible be planning ? 
5320	1404	If they are really such evil motivated people , again , why do most Republicans\/conservatives defend the Iraq war ? 
5321	1404	Now ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ have gone and called these Muslims ignorant . 
5322	1404	That THEY would not be able to figure out that THEY are being manipulated , sounds a little condescending and something that GOP find alarming coming from someone that calls CONDESCENDING a Christian . 
5323	1404	As if , those that oppose the Mosque are the only ones blessed with the ability to see beyond the obvious , and know what is in people 's hearts . 
5324	1404	There are other mosques in the area , and also bars . 
5325	1404	So , why does this one hold `` special '' powers ? 
5326	1404	On Sunday , Jon Kyl -LRB- R-AZ -RRB- went on Face the Nation and suggested , that with all the anchor babies running around , SUNDAY might be time to scrap the 14th Amendment . 
5327	1404	Now , the Senate Minority Leader agrees . 
5328	1404	Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is the latest high-profile Republican to say Congress should reconsider the guarantee of birthright citizenship provided by the 14th Amendment , in light of the current debate over immigration reform . 
5329	1404	http:\/\/firedoglake.com\/2010\/08\/03\/re...-brown-people\/ I did n't say there was anything wrong with the Tea Party ideology , GOP was just reminding the other poster that even if 14TH claims 14TH is n't , 14TH posts say otherwise . 
5330	1404	But , as far as the right-wing , GOP , Tea Party saving our country , most of those people that are part of the Tea Party were George Bush supporters and OUR know what BUSH did to the country . 
5331	1404	And all GOP know of PEOPLE ideology is `` tax cuts for the wealthy '' ! 
5332	1404	Pardon the expression but that is a bunch of crap . 
5333	1404	That is the same rhetoric that Rush Limbaugh and the rest of the wealthy Republicans are saying because PEOPLE want to keep PEOPLE tax cuts . 
5335	1404	GOP thought ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ sounded rational for a while - now ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ are beginning to sound like the rest of the `` scared to death by the GOP media '' crowd . 
5336	1406	ITS s a run down textile mill . 
5337	1406	No A am not saying that . 
5338	1406	CHRISTIAN am suspicious of why ITS being built were its being build and do not believe the developer . 
5339	1406	CHRISTIAN fully agree It was not the moderate Muslims fault that their religion is being hijacked by radical elements . 
5340	1406	The developers are within DEVELOPERS rights to build FAULT . 
5341	1406	And open and dedicate on 9\/11 . 
5342	1406	But having the right does not make building RIGHT right ! 
5343	1406	CHRISTIAN feel bad for both sides that there is so much torment over this mosque , however CHRISTIAN can understand why the majority of Americans are against MOSQUE . 
5344	1406	A Mosque five hundred feet from ground zero . 
5345	1406	The terrorists were Muslim extremist . 
5346	1406	The prayers will blast out over a loud speaker five times a day reminding the victims and the family s of the victims what happened . 
5347	1406	CHRISTIAN am happy ASPECT_MERTEX_ are of the faith ! 
5348	1406	CHRISTIAN too am a Christian . 
5349	1406	CHRISTIAN was a atheist prior to that but God broke CHRISTIAN legs to make CHRISTIAN an offer CHRISTIAN couldn t refuse ie die or try Christianity ! 
5350	1406	Ha ha . 
5351	1406	Anyway well with all due respect CHRISTIAN disagree with the popular interpretation of Romans . 
5352	1406	Here is a site that CHRISTIAN think mirrors CHRISTIAN understanding of that scripture . 
5353	1406	SITE s different than what ASPECT_MERTEX_ believe , but maybe we can at least understand each others beliefs . 
5354	1406	CHRISTIAN am guilty of calling Obama a few names out of anger and fear and agree ANGER not anything to be proud of , but CHRISTIAN do not think ANGER s a terribly bad sin . 
5355	1406	http:\/\/www.wnd.com\/news\/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=22417Sorry for not putting ANGER in CHRISTIAN own words but CHRISTIAN have been writing grant proposals for the missions two days and nights non stop so the least typing CHRISTIAN have to do the better ! 
5356	1406	HTTP:\/\/WWW.WND.COM\/NEWS\/ARTICLE.ASP?ARTICLE_ID=22417SORRY 500 feet from ground zero and the call to prayer will easily be heard at ground zero . 
5357	1406	CHRISTIAN am surprised that ASPECT_MERTEX_ think the 3000 families of the dead and double that number wounded would be lying about the harm this thing is going to do . 
5358	1406	That saddens CHRISTIAN that ASPECT_MERTEX_ would think that especially after ASPECT_MERTEX_ are so adamant about offending Obama by calling OBAMA names etc. . 
5359	1406	Think about 3000 . 
5360	1406	3000 families that s at least six to nine thousand people not to mention the survivors of the other attacks . 
5361	1406	CHRISTIAN don t think FAMILIES want to deny anyone FAMILIES rights , but this kind of thing will breed real anger and hurt . 
5362	1406	All for what ? 
5363	1406	What by protesting the mosque ? 
5364	1406	CHRISTIAN agree that some liberal politics are more in line with Jesus teachings , but CHRISTIAN would not fear Jesus if CHRISTIAN were in a peaceful protest march when JESUS came back . 
5365	1406	CHRISTIAN believe the developers of the mosque has hidden motives for building the mosque too . 
5366	1406	CHRISTIAN will be interested in seeing where the funding is coming from . 
5367	1406	Christians would not build a church on top of a Muslim cemetery for starters , and CHRISTIAN believe STARTERS would . 
5368	1406	CHRISTIAN are a Christian would ASPECT_MERTEX_ move ASPECT_MERTEX_ church if the situation was reversed ? 
5369	1406	CHRISTIAN would . 
5370	1406	With all due respect , ASPECT_MERTEX_ seem less and less like a Christian the more ASPECT_MERTEX_ talk . 
5371	1406	The ten commandants plaques are tradition in most cases . 
5372	1406	Congress prays for the tradition as well . 
5373	1406	In most cases CONGRESS s the attitude of activist atheists that make Christians bow up . 
5374	1406	In every case CHRISTIAN have seen these atheists want to harm or destroy Christianity by forcing ends to long held traditions . 
5375	1406	In many cases ATHEISTS want to harm us not to improve anything . 
5376	1406	ASPECT_MERTEX_ ideas of obeying corrupt government are not Christian CHRISTIAN friend . 
5377	1406	CHRISTIAN wish ASPECT_MERTEX_ would take some time to read opposing views . 
5378	1406	That link CHRISTIAN gave ASPECT_MERTEX_ is a start . 
5379	1406	Remember Jesus was a rebel . 
5380	1406	True CHRISTIAN never have . 
5381	1406	CHRISTIAN am a Reverend . 
5382	1406	So CHRISTIAN see and talk to a lot of Christians . 
5383	1406	There is some ignorance out there , however most traditional christians do not hate all Muslims , just the radicalized terrorists that want to impose CHRISTIANS religion on us or murder US . 
5384	1406	CHRISTIAN already did in CHRISTIAN first post . 
5385	1406	CHRISTIAN gave several reasons and CHRISTIAN am researching this mosque hoping to run down the funding . 
5386	1406	What would ASPECT_MERTEX_ say if Islamic terrorists were funding part of the Mosque ? 
5387	1406	ASPECT_MERTEX_ are rather insensitive . 
5388	1406	Or maybe CHRISTIAN am misreading ASPECT_MERTEX_ post please clarify POST ? 
5389	1406	Yea and the Mosque too ? 
5390	1406	The New York Republican party is also said to be planning a hostile television campaign . 
5391	1406	REPUBLICAN depends on how hostile the program is CHRISTIAN suppose . 
5392	1406	REPUBLICAN all bad stuff . 
5393	1406	CHRISTIAN fear that the thing will get blown up or after THING built something will happen . 
5394	1406	CHRISTIAN just wish THEMSELVES would not put THEMSELVES and the city full of people in harms way and build somewhere else . 
5395	1406	see next post this one was over ten thousand letters over the limit ! 
5396	1406	end of part one ! 
5397	1407	Part two ! 
5398	1407	If they are really such evil motivated people , again , THEY could be planning or preparing for anything . 
5399	1407	I am not saying THEY are . 
5400	1407	However I have been around the block a few times and I have found that when peoples deeds do not match THEY words someone is rotten in Denmark ! 
5401	1407	Too many things do not make sense ! 
5402	1407	We will have to wait and see I suppose . 
5403	1407	God help WE WE are going to need BLOCK . 
5404	1407	ASPECT_MERTEX_ have a very strange way of thinking , not real bad just strange . 
5405	1407	Absolutely no disrespect meant ! 
5406	1407	However , if I was casually reading ASPECT_MERTEX_ posts I would think that ATHEIST were a secular humanist atheist . 
5407	1407	Not a immoral atheist\/SH , but an atheist nevertheless Most conservatives must think the Iraq war was worthwhile . 
5408	1407	I don t and I do lean conservative . 
5410	1407	Did ASPECT_MERTEX_ read I disclaimer ? 
5411	1407	Where did I call the Muslims ignorant ? 
5412	1407	I hope that is not ASPECT_MERTEX_ words in I mouth ! 
5413	1407	Oh only God will go to heaven and who will not . 
5414	1407	So if I were ASPECT_MERTEX_ I would not be throwing rocks cause ASPECT_MERTEX_ sure are living in a glass crib -LRB- house -RRB- ! 
5415	1407	No that s not what I said . 
5416	1407	Muslims as well as Christians follow MUSLIMS leaders . 
5417	1407	I do not trust the developers etc. . 
5418	1407	The general population of Muslims are wonderful people , which I have said over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over ! 
5419	1407	Even posting a disclaimer ! 
5420	1407	Because DISCLAIMER being dedicated on 9\/11 being built on nearly on top if not on top of the remains of victims , because the funding is hidden and VICTIMS will not reveal DISCLAIMER , because of the name of the center . 
5421	1407	And there is more . 
5422	1407	Thanks for ASPECT_MERTEX_ reply and write soon ! 
5424	1408	I THINK Bush KEPT A SMALL AMOUNT OF SOLDIERS IN Afghanistan BECAUSE BUSH WAS NOT PLANNING ON PROCEEDING WITH THAT SENSLESS WAR ... . 
5425	1408	BUSH THOUGHT BUSH WOULD PLACE CREDENCE IN OUR BORDERS , AND PULL OUR MEN FROM That region since their is no grounds to fight , THEIR are holes , heat , and deflection , a war is stupid to fight in that region of the world , our men are much more important ... JolleeNOTE : Although Obama said this Afghanistan war was the right war ! 
5426	1409	Hi Jolee . 
5427	1409	Well at least in Afghanistan we were killing the goons that supported the Taliban cowardly murderous actions of 9\/11 . 
5428	1409	The same can not be said for Iraq two though . 
5429	1409	I admire ASPECT_JOLLEE_ passion . 
5430	1409	Rev AOh the attachment . 
5431	1409	I thin frame 1911 military spc .45 colt style pistol -LRB- 1911 a Springfield Armory -RRB- with Wilson combat magazine . 
5432	1409	I like a forty five for conceal carry because although SPC heavy HEAVY thin , thin enough to were a t over HEAVY . 
5433	1409	That big bullet is from a full size .50 browning Machine Gun round -LRB- BMG -RRB- 
5434	1410	Hi Jolee . 
5435	1410	Well at least in Afghanistan we were killing the goons that supported the Taliban cowardly murderous actions of 9\/11 . 
5436	1410	The same can not be said for Iraq two though . 
5437	1410	I admire ASPECT_JOLLEE_ passion . 
5438	1410	Rev AOh the attachment . 
5439	1410	I thin frame 1911 military spc .45 colt style pistol -LRB- 1911 a Springfield Armory -RRB- with Wilson combat magazine . 
5440	1410	I like a forty five for conceal carry because although SPC heavy HEAVY thin , thin enough to were a t over HEAVY . 
5441	1410	That big bullet is from a full size .50 browning Machine Gun round -LRB- BMG -RRB- 
5442	1411	Are ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ saying that the model 1911 .45 caliber bullet is the same as the Browning .50 bullet ? 
5443	1411	Not the complete round , but just the bullet SAME . 
5444	1411	If so , ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ have n't any clue about weapons at all , and are simply a child trolling on this site . 
5445	1411	The only differences in the bullets are , different diameters , different lengths , different weights , different shapes , and can not be fired from the same gun , either .45 , or .50 . 
5446	1411	The similarities are that they are both called bullets . 
5447	1412	First , I wish ASPECT_BIGBOB_ would learn how to post - FIRST would make FIRST a lot easier to respond to ASPECT_BIGBOB_ if ASPECT_BIGBOB_ used the conventional method provided by PF . 
5448	1412	And , to answer ASPECT_BIGBOB_ question - No , QUESTION does n't make sense . 
5449	1412	If ASPECT_BIGBOB_ are lumping all Muslims together as responsible for 9\/11 , then pray tell why in the hell are we killing WE soldiers to provide `` Muslims '' in Iraq with a democracy . 
5450	1412	That is what does n't make any sense . 
5451	1412	Conservatives cheer and whoop MUSLIMS up that 4000 + soldiers have given CONSERVATIVES lives to give Muslims in Iraq a democracy and then whine , -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- and revolt over Muslims building a community center . 
5452	1412	So , ASPECT_BIGBOB_ blame all `` Muslims '' for what 19 Al-Qaeda terrorists did ? 
5453	1412	That figures . 
5454	1412	Ignorance abounds . 
5455	1412	The September 11 attacks -LRB- often referred to as September 11th or 9\/11 -RRB- were a series of coordinated suicide attacks by al-Qaeda upon the United States on September 11 , 2001 . 
5456	1412	On that morning , 19 al-Qaeda terrorists hijacked four commercial passenger jet airliners . 
5457	1412	So , are ASPECT_BIGBOB_ suggesting that all Islam Mosque 's in the US are dangerous and should be destroyed ? 
5458	1412	ASPECT_BIGBOB_ comment does n't make sense . 
5459	1412	I think ASPECT_BIGBOB_ comments are convoluted . 
5460	1413	The fact that ASPECT_DAN40_ ignore all the antics of the Tea Party , the crazy whacko 's like Sharon Angle and WHACKO off the wall suggestions , the rantings of Palin and Michelle Bachmann and claim that the Tea Party is somehow the answer to America 's problems is what is truly laughable . 
5461	1413	The way they bow at the knee at the mention of ANGLE name would make one wonder . 
5462	1413	Thank God , that it is not possible to bring GOD back , because , ASPECT_DAN40_ may deny WAY , but I know a lot of Teabaggers that worship the ground GOD walks on . 
5463	1413	The near instantaneous growth of the tea party after the elections was because of the `` fear '' and `` anger '' that a `` black '' man was now at the helm . 
5464	1413	And the instantaneous support geared at Palin -LRB- Tea Party fave -RRB- , is another indication that the Tea Party is not really interested in people who exercise frugality to reflect TEABAGGERS conservatism , but rather in someone that uses catchy phrases , made-up words and does not practice conservatism in PEOPLE own life . 
5465	1413	ASPECT_DAN40_ rantings are truly comical . 
5466	1413	There is none more incompetent than Bush , and certainly McSame , who was not even able to tell the state of the economy when MCSAME was at the point of collapse , nor BUSH Caribou Barbie who does n't even read the newspapers and prides SOMEONE on foreign policy because SOMEONE thinks SOMEONE can see Russia from SOMEONE back porch , can compare with Obama 's intelligence , eloquence and capabilities . 
5467	1413	That is the dream of right-wing fanatics of Bush , because FANATICS would love for someone to replace that Bozo in the `` worst President '' category , unfortunately , MCSAME does n't look like MCSAME is going to happen . 
5468	1413	Already , Obama has been given accolades that Bush does n't even know how to pronounce . 
5469	1413	Obama 15th Greatest President Funny that ASPECT_DAN40_ should mention that , being that Bozobush is known for having taken the most time off than any other president . 
5470	1413	Vacationing Bush Sets Record on Time Off That would have been Bush , Obama 's staff continues to work when BUSH is on vacation . 
5471	1413	RECORD is the constant sniping and whining from the `` right '' that wears on BUSH , but BUSH is resilient enough to withstand all that vitriol . 
5472	1413	And even if we lose seats in November , which is normal for the party of the sitting president , WE will still have a majority - and Reps\/cons will still be whining and crying and saying `` wait till next election '' ! 
5473	1414	He is showing wear because HE is deeply lost . 
5474	1414	In way over HE head . 
5475	1414	HE 's so far out of HE capability that HE does n't even realize CAPABILITY , and is confused that nothing works . 
5476	1414	And nothing works because the top , oBum , does n't know what HE is doing . 
5477	1414	And HE gang of YES MEN thugs only know Chicago payola and threats politics . 
5478	1414	Beyond THUGS HE gets unworkable ideas from the Utopian dreamland far left . 
5479	1414	I 'd be surprised if HE is n't HAPPY to go in 2012 . 
5480	1415	Another person that does n't know the conventional way of posting ! 
5482	1415	ASPECT_DAN40_ 've been listening to Faux News too long . 
5483	1415	Reps may take a few seats , but CZARS doubt REPS will defeat anyone . 
5484	1415	Most of the Tea Partiers CZARS have seen interviewed do n't know up from down , think Glenn Beck should be president , claim Barack Obama is in the Bible as the `` anti-christ '' , think Obama was the first to use the term `` Czars '' , some are in support of Medicare , some want FIRST abolished - Watch this video - ASPECT_DAN40_ 'll see how really ignorant and discombobulated SOME are : YouTube - 9.12 DC TEA PARTY - MARCH FOOTAGE WITH ... Nothing works ? 
5485	1415	BECK got Health Care reformed passed , something that neither HW Bush , nor Reagan , and certainly not Bozobush were able to accomplish . 
5486	1415	Also , BECK passed finance reform . 
5487	1415	BECK was able to get unemployment extended in spite of the selfish Republicans who only want to give tax cuts to the wealthy . 
5488	1415	So quit spewing lies , UNEMPLOYMENT makes ASPECT_DAN40_ entire post look suspect . 
5489	1415	Now ASPECT_DAN40_ are just venting venom and hate because ASPECT_DAN40_ have nothing of substance to offer . 
5490	1415	The Republicans in Congress have shown where WEALTHY loyalties lie , with the very wealthy and the corporations ! 
5491	1415	Are ASPECT_DAN40_ contributing to the BP fund - ASPECT_DAN40_ know , the one to help BP clean up the mess CONTRIBUTING made so CONTRIBUTING wo n't have to spend any of CONTRIBUTING millions and have to cut bonuses for CONTRIBUTING CEO 's ? 
5492	1415	ASPECT_DAN40_ Republican Congressmen would appreciate FUND if ASPECT_DAN40_ would contribute . 
5493	1416	Everything ASPECT_MERTEX_ post is obvious that it is what the left wing liberals have brainwashed ASPECT_MERTEX_ into thinking . 
5494	1416	Nothing ASPECT_MERTEX_ post shows any original thought . 
5495	1416	REPUBLICAN challenged ASPECT_MERTEX_ to GO and research and LEARN for ASPECT_MERTEX_ . 
5496	1416	But instead ASPECT_MERTEX_ preach the NYTimes or MSNBC line about the tea party . 
5497	1416	No personal experience , no personal knowledge . 
5498	1416	ASPECT_MERTEX_ are lost in ASPECT_MERTEX_ ideology . 
5499	1416	ASPECT_MERTEX_ continue to say things about REPUBLICAN candidate and about REPUBLICAN party and REPUBLICAN former President . 
5500	1416	Regardless of the FACT that REPUBLICAN have informed ASPECT_MERTEX_ that REPUBLICAN am not a Republican . 
5501	1416	And REPUBLICAN did not vote for Bush . 
5502	1416	ASPECT_MERTEX_ ask how to explain a sign at a tea party rally . 
5504	1416	1 called free speech . 
5505	1416	Right or wrong , 1 free speech . 
5507	1416	there have been proven instances of liberals attending tea party rallies to cause trouble and to show ignorant signs . 
5508	1416	But ASPECT_MERTEX_ do n't know since ASPECT_MERTEX_ will only believe what the leftist propagandists tell ASPECT_MERTEX_ to believe . 
5509	1416	But if ASPECT_MERTEX_ would go and SEE for ASPECT_MERTEX_ , ASPECT_MERTEX_ would see people displaying slurring signs being asked , in no uncertain terms to get out and stay out . 
5510	1416	And PEOPLE get out and stand in front of the liberal cameras . 
5511	1416	And PEOPLE KNOW right where PEOPLE have the liberal cameras . 
5512	1416	And seem to be on a first name basis with the liberal media people . 
5513	1416	But the smear campaign will fail because the liberals are up against an aroused American public . 
5514	1416	Not a self serving ideology . 
5515	1417	Just shows ASPECT_MERTEX_ that Harry Reid is just another chameleon with no convictions . 
5516	1417	Yeah , and I already pointed out to ASPECT_MERTEX_ that some of them do not want that Mosque there either . 
5517	1417	We 'll see about that . 
5518	1417	The Dems believe that DEMS is a living , breathing document . 
5519	1417	Obama said DEMS was a `` charter of negative liberties '' . 
5520	1417	If ASPECT_MERTEX_ think the Dems respect The Constitution , ASPECT_MERTEX_ have n't been paying attention . 
5521	1417	The Tea Party is what every American should support , unless ASPECT_MERTEX_ like big government , more bureaucracy , and more taxes . 
5522	1417	I guess ASPECT_MERTEX_ would re-elect Obama no matter how much that one-man wrecking ball is destroying this country . 
5523	1418	That is an intentional LIE . 
5524	1418	Same as someone saying LIE is not a community center . 
5525	1418	CENTER is a community center AND a mosque . 
5526	1418	So CENTER IS a mosque . 
5527	1418	Saying CENTER not a mosque , only a community center is like saying a Catholic Church is a Bingo parlor . 
5528	1418	Bingo gets played but FIRST is a church , first and foremost . 
5529	1418	And the fiasco in NY is a mosque , first and foremost . 
5530	1420	This is so true . 
5531	1420	They wo n't campaign on HCR , bailouts , or the stimulus , because THEY know none of THEY are popular with The People . 
5532	1420	That just leaves what ASPECT_DAN40_ mentioned : Bush ... oh , and the racist Tea Party movement . 
5533	1420	HOPE certainly hope THEY will not continue to campaign on `` Hope and Change '' because we can see where that is getting WE . 
5534	1422	ASPECT_DAN40_ just ca n't handle the truth , so go ahead and do like most Reps , hide under a rock and believe what Faux News tells ASPECT_DAN40_ . 
5535	1422	Those were the members of ASPECT_DAN40_ `` so-called high falutin Tea Party '' expressing MEMBERS dumbness . 
5536	1422	Sorry that ASPECT_DAN40_ do n't see MEMBERS for what MEMBERS are and try and tell FALUTIN that MEMBERS are informed Americans ! 
5538	1422	Yeah , yeah , FALUTIN know . 
5539	1422	All of a sudden all those people that voted for Bush , do n't even know who Bush is ! 
5540	1422	FALUTIN do n't blame ASPECT_DAN40_ for trying to distance ASPECT_DAN40_ from that buffoon , BUFFOON really did n't do the country any good . 
5541	1422	Sure COUNTRY 's free speech , that is why the racists are able to carry RACISTS racist signs and get a free pass from the rest . 
5542	1422	Typical Republican\/conservative response - blame the Democrats , RACISTS infiltrated our party and RACISTS were the ones with the signs , right ! 
5543	1422	RACISTS capture COUNTRY on video - FALUTIN do n't have to be there to see the racist signs and RACISTS interview people , so FALUTIN can then hear PEOPLE `` lost '' look and dumb answers . 
5544	1422	America is getting to see just how whacky the Republicans have gotten . 
5545	1422	Really - now RACISTS are telling all RACISTS people that the Muslims are going to get RACISTS and kill RACISTS children - like the boogy-man ! 
5546	1422	Is that the only way ASPECT_DAN40_ can get votes ? 
5547	1423	Do ASPECT_MERTEX_ mean the America that has a 60\/40 disapproval rating against obama ? 
5548	1423	That America . 
5549	1423	Or the 20 % of Americans that trust the Democrats ? 
5550	1423	That America ? 
5551	1423	ORAnd this one is hilarious , The America that now sees a 45 to 44 approval rating of Bush over obie the idiot . 
5552	1423	That America ? 
5553	1423	In the USA we have 2 newspaper that lean right . 
5554	1423	ALL the rest are very to extremely leftist and do nothing but run what amounts to commercials for liberal ideas . 
5555	1423	WE have one TV station that leans right , but does present the other side . 
5556	1423	All the rest of TV is exactly like the leftist newspapers . 
5557	1423	On radio there are some right leaning to very right wing talk shows . 
5558	1423	And the same can be said for the left , only there are more of them . 
5559	1423	So in media matters the left dominates communication by more than 20 to 1 . 
5560	1423	Maybe 100 to 1 . 
5561	1423	Yet , America , does not believe the bill of goods the left is selling . 
5562	1423	America hears ASPECT_MERTEX_ story 20 or more times for every time they hear the story from the right , yet THEY side with the story from the right . 
5563	1423	Is the right that much more convincing , or is the right simply pointing out what the intelligent nation can see for NATION . 
5564	1423	ASPECT_MERTEX_ want more respect from America ? 
5565	1423	Stop insulting THEY intelligence . 
5566	1423	THEY can see the stupidity and unsustainability of ASPECT_MERTEX_ liberalism BETTER than ASPECT_MERTEX_ can . 
5567	1424	If ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ opinion is based on the following , I would suggest ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ stop reading FOX Nation and stop watching FOX News . 
5568	1424	Read some news papers or some fact-checking websites . 
5569	1424	Turn off the cable news . 
5570	1424	He is less than half way into HE term and has already kept or compromised on 160 . 
5571	1424	81 are stalled either due to Republican obstructionism -LRB- record fillibusters -RRB- or various other reasons . 
5572	1424	The majority are in the works , and 22 have been outright broken . 
5573	1424	ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ lied . 
5574	1424	SOURCE : http:\/\/www.politifact.com\/truth-o-meter\/promises\/ www.recovery.govwww.whitehouse.govE tc , etc. . 
5575	1424	I have never seen so much information been made open to the public by any administration . 
5576	1424	This is a matter of opinion , and I get the feeling judging by the tone of ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ previous posts that anything this administration does will not please ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ . 
5577	1424	Oh really ? 
5578	1424	I guess this never happened , then ? 
5579	1424	I guess the extra money I get each check is just a figment of I imagination ? 
5580	1424	I guess the credit when I filed I income tax last year was an illusion ? 
5581	1424	ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ lie . 
5582	1424	The Bush tax cuts sun-setting will not raise taxes on the middle class under the Democrat 's proposed plan . 
5583	1424	SUN-SETTING will only raise taxes on individuals grossing over $ 200,000 or families grossing over $ 250,000 . 
5584	1424	Do ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ homework . 
5585	1424	Also , stop lying . 
5586	1424	Saying LYING 's going to raise taxes on everyone is nothing but ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ own wistful thinking . 
5587	1424	Do n't peddle THINKING as fact . 
5589	1424	LYING has actually cut useless or wasteful government programs in order to save a few billion dollars here and there . 
5590	1424	I think ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ 're mistaking Obama with Bush . 
5591	1424	Also , stop lying . 
5592	1424	Popular opinion is a fickle thing and changes depending on who is better at communicating their message . 
5593	1424	Republicans are notoriously good at doing so through emotionally charge rhetoric and propaganda . 
5594	1424	Some of us -LRB- I included -RRB- rely on facts to form US opinions rather than rhetoric , so while ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ may disagree -LRB- for whatever reason -RRB- with cost-saving measures such as insurance reform , SOME are the right thing to do both morally and financially . 
5595	1424	Yet again ... what the hell ? 
5596	1424	ICE has actually deported more people under Obama than PEOPLE did under Bush , and Obama has only been in office for a year and a half . 
5597	1424	Where are ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ getting ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ `` facts '' from ? 
5598	1424	Far too vague for I to argue against . 
5599	1424	Far too vague for I to argue against . 
5601	1424	While HIM is n't anything like the reincarnation of Franklin Delano Roosevelt that I was hoping for , I will certainly vote for him over anyone the Republicans field , unless a Teddy Roosevelt Republican comes out of the woodwork . 
5602	1426	The campaign promise has been filled ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ know ... according to the clowns in the Whitehouse we are pulling out of this recession . 
5603	1426	CLOWNS have CLOWNS heads so far in the sand with ears plugged saying '' Lalalala . 
5604	1426	I ca n't hear ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ America '' . 
5606	1427	Technically , they are correct . 
5607	1427	Until we see negative GDP growth for more than 2 quarters in a row , THEY will continue to assert this as well . 
5608	1427	But with the calculations changes for unemployment as well as the change from GNP to GDP to track the economy , the figures have been much more forgiving for the feds to report these figures to the general public . 
5609	1427	Still , does n't help the public at all . 
5610	1429	Maybe ASPECT_BADGERED_MUSHROOM_ need to expand ASPECT_BADGERED_MUSHROOM_ knowledge , and turn on the cable news and listen to talk radio . 
5611	1429	ASPECT_BADGERED_MUSHROOM_ only get the warm fuzzies from the MSM . 
5612	1429	Obstructing Obama is a good thing . 
5613	1429	OBAMA has been forced to be more transparent , but OBAMA did n't start off that way as promised . 
5614	1429	Just wait until 1\/1\/2011 , at which time taxes will be raised for everyone to cover HCR . 
5615	1429	All tax brackets increase . 
5616	1429	OBAMA spending dwarfs any cuts . 
5617	1429	Assuming all goes well and stays on track ? 
5619	1429	The deficits from Obama will be history-making . 
5620	1429	Obamacare was against the wishers of The People . 
5621	1429	Many want LOL repealed now . 
5622	1429	No thanks to Obama . 
5623	1434	Typical liberal reasoning . 
5624	1434	Does n't really have any meaning or substance . 
5625	1434	There I fixed it for ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ . 
5626	1435	Remember that whole banning lobbyist from THAT Admin ? 
5627	1435	That did n't even last 1 day . 
5629	1436	Typical liberal reasoning . 
5630	1436	Does n't really have any meaning or substance . 
5631	1436	Are ASPECT_JTHORP24_ trying to have a reasonable and meaningful conversation with me ? 
5632	1436	Maybe ASPECT_JTHORP24_ 're trying to ask ME why ME like Obama . 
5633	1436	Or maybe CONVERSATION that ASPECT_JTHORP24_ 're puzzled by someone thinking ASPECT_JTHORP24_ would most likely vote for someone ASPECT_JTHORP24_ like now . 
5634	1437	I wanna know how he can take credit for the combat troops leaving Iraq . 
5635	1437	Troops are Troops . 
5636	1437	An Engineer , Intel Analyst , Civic Affairs , JAG or whatever still goes to Boot Camp and learns some form basic combat skills . 
5637	1437	GOES have to or GOES do n't get deployed . 
5638	1437	But that 's not even the crux of INTEL . 
5639	1437	All that 's changed is Obama and DoD retitled Brigade Combat Teams to `` advisory and assistance brigades . '' 
5640	1437	The troops still in Iraq will still be in combat when TROOPS go on missions with Iraqi troops . 
5641	1437	Doubt this information ? 
5642	1437	Read up on 2\/25th -LRB- 2nd Stryker Bridge , 25th Inf Division -RRB- and TROOPS recent deployment to FOB Warhorse . 
5643	1437	Obama has lied 
5644	1439	ASPECT_AUSTRIANECON_ 'll never hear Obama say OBAMA 's taking credit for it . 
5645	1439	CREDIT must have been a Fox News contributer that fed ASPECT_AUSTRIANECON_ that info . 
5646	1440	I would like to know why ASPECT_CANDACE_ like him ... What has HIM done that ASPECT_CANDACE_ like ? 
5647	1441	Making UNPOPULAR decisions . 
5648	1442	That 's sort of what I was thinking . 
5649	1444	He is not making unpopular decisions . 
5650	1444	HE is making ideological decisions that do not and have not worked . 
5651	1444	The decisions are unpopular because people that do not share HE rigid ideology see them as stupid decisions . 
5652	1444	Like spending our way to prosperity on borrowed money . 
5653	1444	Or , `` OUR are going to win the Afghan war and leave next year . '' 
5655	1444	If he was not both driven and bound by HE ideology , HE would react to the problems instead of pushing the same old , same old , tired program . 
5656	1444	Once again last night , in HE speech , HE philosophizes with no specifics , and then promotes , more regulation , education reform , and cap and trade . 
5657	1444	More regulation = more taxes ON EVERYONE . 
5658	1444	Reform education = more taxes on everyone . 
5659	1444	Cap and trade = more taxes on everyone . 
5660	1444	In case ASPECT_SINCE1981_ have n't broken his code . 
5661	1445	Well Dan , instead of pointing the finger , post ASPECT_DAN40_ own ideas ? 
5662	1445	We 're so quick to point the finger & rack up points , but WE have no fvcking clue on how to fix things . 
5663	1446	Hundreds of ideas have been offered , by me , by others . 
5664	1446	But HUNDREDS are contrary to his rigid , unchangeable , ideological position . 
5665	1446	The health care debate on TV was the prime living example . 
5666	1446	Obama calls for an open conference on health care reform ideas . 
5667	1446	Even the day before the conference OBAMA is publicly saying the Republican are the party of NO. . 
5668	1446	That 's on the EVE of a ` compromise ' conference OBAMA asks for . 
5669	1446	Then in the actual OBAMA dismisses out of hand EVERY idea put forth . 
5670	1446	No assessment of ACTUAL merit or lack , just does n't fit OBAMA goal . 
5671	1446	OBAMA also insults a crippled wounded combat American hero in a completely hateful and arrogant manner . 
5672	1446	OBAMA also states that although OBAMA will not use any Republican ideas , OBAMA will no longer say that they do not have any ideas . 
5673	1446	The NEXT day OBAMA says , the Republicans do not have any ideas . 
5674	1446	OBAMA has no clue how to negotiate anything . 
5675	1446	In multiple situations OBAMA has either acted in a knee-jerk fashion without waiting for full information , or has not reacted at all when OBAMA needed to . 
5676	1446	A real , capable executive , knows when to act and when to hold back . 
5677	1446	OBAMA gets FASHION wrong both ways . 
5678	1446	There are very strict protocols of what to do and what to say and how to say FASHION when dealing with other Governments . 
5679	1446	Obama IGNORES the advice of the State Dept. and does whatever OBAMA wishes , as OBAMA wishes . 
5680	1446	The result is a constant mixed and confused message being sent to both our friends and OUR enemies . 
5681	1446	And ALWAYS , confusion is seen as weakness by both friend and foe . 
5682	1448	Ah but I think ASPECT_SINCE1981_ fail to see his true colors ! 
5683	1448	HIS has abandoned the legal working middle class of Americans completely knowing that HIS has lost US by HIS broken promises and forcing HIS agenda upon us such as the much disliked atrocity called the health care plan . 
5684	1448	Anyway look at who HIS is befriending ! 
5685	1448	The illegal aliens which means the Hispanic voting block . 
5686	1448	And of course the black voting block . 
5687	1448	I beleive that this is a calculated strategy and one that will fail because the votes are not there . 
5688	1448	I used to beleive as ASPECT_SINCE1981_ until I began realizing that HISPANIC was ignoring the wishes of the voters over and over so many times I began asking I why is HISPANIC doing that ? 
5689	1448	So no HISPANIC is playing HISPANIC ace in the hole and giving VOTERS everything VOTERS want in a desperate hope that VOTERS will win HISPANIC reelection IMO . 
5691	1449	aEXCERPT ; Yes HE too wish we as a nation were as loved as WE supposedly were in the early 60 's . 
5692	1449	HE read a book from that era that was entitled how to go around the world on a pound of pot and a backpack . 
5693	1449	Ha ha that was before Nam had really been in living rooms for long enough to poison the world against WE the JFK was in Office and everyone seemed to love WE or so that was what HE have been told . 
5694	1449	But then Nam lasted ten years then there was other bad things including the CIA in south America and the middle east wars . 
5695	1449	HE too thought Obama might change that . 
5696	1449	But no he has been a disappointment because the man is all about MAN . 
5697	1449	MAN only wants MAN vision of what MAN thinks the USA should be , which seems to be a semi or totally socialist country where everyone is dependent on government . 
5698	1449	No Obama is toxic . 
5699	1449	HE beleive that the man is a threat to the survival of our nation . 
5700	1449	HE could explain why MAN trillion dollar here and trillion dollar there plans of flushing good money after bad will probably stop the feeble recovery and maybe force OUR into a depression which will have world wide consequences . 
5701	1449	If the USA really crashes in a 1920s style depression -LRB- USA will be much worse really -RRB- the world will crash with OUR . 
5702	1449	And then OUR will really be hated ! 
5703	1449	\*\*\* -LRB- a nervous ha ha ... -RRB- \*\*\* please forgive the dark humor ... ? 
5705	1450	Hundreds of ideas have been offered , by me , by others .

5724	1450	After parsing thru the rant , ME did n't see one idea proposed in there on how Dan would have fixed things . 
5725	1450	Did anyone else ? 
5727	1451	So he did n't sit in the oval office talking about it last night ? 
5728	1452	Well I refuse to continually repeat I for the slow . 
5729	1452	But ASPECT_IRIEMON_ may search back and find I suggestions . 
5730	1452	That 's what words like , `` Hundreds of ideas have been offered , by ASPECT_IRIEMON_ , by others . '' 
5731	1452	That ideas HAVE been presented . 
5732	1452	If ASPECT_IRIEMON_ memory is insufficient or ASPECT_IRIEMON_ do not wish to look . 
5733	1452	That is ASPECT_IRIEMON_ choice . 
5734	1452	And since ASPECT_IRIEMON_ have absolutely nothing to post other than ASPECT_IRIEMON_ liberal ideological brain damage . 
5735	1452	I could not possibly care less what ASPECT_IRIEMON_ say or `` think . '' 
5736	1452	If ASPECT_IRIEMON_ do . 
5738	1453	The novel , `` The Ugly American . '' 
5739	1453	was published in 1958 . 
5740	1453	It was written because of the way Americans were even then universally hated worldwide . 
5741	1453	And what we did to foster that hate . 
5742	1453	Even in WWII when WE were staging in England for the D-Day invasion of Europe , WE good friends the British said -LRB- in 1942-1944 -RRB- `` The trouble with the Americans is that WE are over sexed , over fed , and over here ! 
5743	1453	`` For over 150 years WE have been the HAVES . 
5744	1453	And WE have not been shy about YEARS . 
5745	1453	Human nature should tell BRITISH that the HAVE NOTS are not going to appreciate WE . 
5746	1453	BHO has done nothing to change that . 
5747	1454	Good for ASPECT_DAN40_ . 
5748	1454	I stand by I post . 
5749	1455	I hope ASPECT_IRIEMON_ packed a lunch and are wearing good shoes because ASPECT_IRIEMON_ 'll be standing there a while . 
5750	1455	A LEFT WING POLLING COMPANY TOOK A POLL IN OHIO . 
5751	1455	Who would ASPECT_IRIEMON_ rather have for President `` Obama 42 % Bush 50 % 
5752	1456	ASPECT_DAN40_ do n't say ? 
5753	1456	How about that . 
5754	1458	Constitutional Law ? 
5755	1458	He only follows constitutional law when LAW suits HE . 
5758	1459	The President is incompetent unqualified , unfortunately , , , , , We will begin too turn around when WE have a Republican Congress , just like most of Clinton 's service , WE have to have balance and check , that is only achieved with opposites in the White house and Congress , , , , Jollee 
5759	1462	GOP Solutions presented earlier this year : http:\/\/www.gop.gov\/solutionsMore from the House Whip : http:\/\/republicanwhip.house.gov\/YouCut\/One thing is for sure : Another blow to the economy come 1\/1\/2011 , when tax hikes galore will occur for every American that actually pays taxes , and does not suck off the system as a career choice . 
5760	1462	Link : http:\/\/www.atr.org\/six-months-untilb...x-hikes-a5171# 
5761	1463	I do n't have a great deal of faith in any politician no matter what party affiliation they claim . 
5762	1463	But The Republicans have put forth dozens of suggestions since oBum took power . 
5763	1463	But the liberal mindset is that if a suggestion , or plan , does not fit DOZENS liberal ideology , not only is SUGGESTION ignored . 
5764	1463	DOZENS ignore MINDSET so completely , DOZENS act like , and CLAIM , that no suggestions were ever offered . 
5765	1464	That 's because , without exception , the crap THAT have offered amounts to simply more of the same tired ass crap that got us into the mess US have now . 
5766	1464	The problem with the conservative ideology is that thinking for oneself is a sin and anything that says otherwise is deemed socialism and evil . 
5767	1464	See ^ ^ ^ ^ I can play the stupid broad generalization game too . 
5768	1465	I rest I case ! 
5769	1465	Here is a person that can not name any suggestions not proposed by a liberal . 
5770	1465	And still backs all liberal suggestions even tho in about 2 years -LRB- 4 years if ASPECT_RSAY32_ start with the Democrat controlled Congress in 2007 -RRB- NONE of the liberal efforts have done anything but fail and waste money . 
5771	1466	Just because it happens on his watch , does n't mean HIS is taking credit for IT . 
5772	1466	HIS simply announced that the Iraq war has ended . 
5773	1466	That 's WAR . 
5774	1466	Someone had to make the announcement , right ? 
5776	1466	If . had n't made a public announcement , ASPECT_AUSTRIANECON_ 'd be flaming . for that too . 
5777	1466	ASPECT_AUSTRIANECON_ just need a reason to keep hating . . 
5778	1466	In my mind , no administration can fix our problems . 
5779	1466	MY predict that the next one 's fans will be pointing FANS fingers at Obama for why FANS ca n't fix FANS either . 
5780	1467	Wow , where do ASPECT_DAN40_ have ASPECT_DAN40_ tent set up ? 
5781	1467	ASPECT_DAN40_ are a pyschic fortune reader right ? 
5782	1467	After all , ASPECT_DAN40_ the arrogance to assume ASPECT_DAN40_ know everything about me and ME politics on the basis of two short posts . 
5783	1467	Never mind , IDEOLOGUE are an ideologue and as such not worth the time or effort TIME would take to educate ASPECT_DAN40_ . 
5784	1468	ASPECT_RSAY32_ bob and weave well , , , obvious , but well . 
5785	1469	Any administration with an open mind and the balls to do MIND could fix the problems . 
5786	1469	MIND would be painful for all and more so for politicians when the problems are shown to be POLITICIANS fault . 
5787	1469	But NO , no administration will fix anything by following POLITICIANS ideological prejudice . 
5788	1470	The Dems have plenty of fault to take the blame for in getting us in this mess also . 
5789	1470	So far , I have not seen anything from the Obama Administration that gives US a glimmer of hope or change on the horizon . 
5790	1470	Obama is spending US into oblivion . 
5791	1470	OBAMA `` Summer Of Recovery '' is a big joke , and just wait until next year when taxes increase . 
5792	1470	If OBAMA gets OBAMA way with Cap & Trade and Amnesty , US 're in for some real hurt . 
5793	1470	Obama is just too stupid to see OBAMA destructive ways . 
5794	1470	I really believe OBAMA thinks OBAMA 's right in what OBAMA is doing . 
5795	1470	I do n't know what playbook OBAMA is using , but OBAMA had better close PLAYBOOK and look at the cover . 
5796	1471	I completely agree . 
5797	1471	And that is why , even though at heart I disagree with most liberal positions , I am not in favor of the republican party regaining power anytime soon . 
5798	1471	I like the shakeup effect the tea party is having on the republicans and I think the party would benefit from stewing in REPUBLICANS own -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- a while longer . 
5799	1471	Maybe then , when REPUBLICANS start listening to REPUBLICANS constituents again and start looking after the interests of America rather than just lining CONSTITUENTS own pockets , REPUBLICANS will be worth voting for again . 
5800	1471	Until then , I am likely to vote for Obama again as -LRB- as I stated in a post just a little ways back in this here very thread -RRB- the lesser of two evils . 
5801	1471	And no , I have not seen anything put forth by the republicans lately that was really worth consideration . 
5802	1471	REPUBLICANS seem to have based REPUBLICANS entire strategy on doing and saying whatever REPUBLICANS think will most obstruct and\/or tear down Obama and the democratic party . 
5803	1471	When REPUBLICANS start acting in America 's interests rather than the republican party 's interests , REPUBLICANS might become relevant again . 
5804	1472	I have never absolved the democrats of any blame . 
5805	1472	I just find it extremely hypocritical of republicans to claim the democrats are solely responsible for the mess this country is in and particulary hilariously hypocritical why DEMOCRATS claim to be more fiscally responsible . 
5806	1473	Why do ASPECT_BIGBOB_ say that ? 
5807	1474	We know this mess is the fault of many , including folks on all sides of the aisle . 
5808	1474	Barney Frank is a big culprit , since FRANK was made aware of the problems with Freddie and Fannie several years ago , but FRANK said MANY were `` sound financial institutions '' . 
5809	1474	Boy was FRANK wrong . 
5810	1474	Also , `` fiscal responsibility '' and `` politicians '' is like `` oil '' and `` water '' . 
5811	1474	However , it is very clear that the Dems and the Obama administration are spending money POLITICIANS do n't have like DEMS grows on trees , or is being printed at the BEP at a record rate . 
5812	1476	ummm ... czars anyone ? 
5813	1476	Firing auto CEO 's from the White House and handing over ownership of a company to a union ? 
5814	1477	Obama never planned on fixing anything for America . 
5815	1477	OBAMA priorities are redistribution of wealth , reparations domestically and internationally , implementing the tenets of socialism , and helping the Muslim world to expand . 
5816	1477	If anything , chaos and problems within America make CHAOS easier to slide these things through , and OBAMA 's all about that , not making America stronger and less likely to accept OBAMA priorities . 
5817	1478	That 's exactly why THAT maintain that he is destructive for America , HE is anything but an American , and HE must not be re-elected . 
5818	1479	Here 's the Republican alternative : http:\/\/republicanwhip.house.gov\/Jobs\/Pander to the electorate . 
5819	1479	Cut taxes , run up more debt . 
5820	1479	Same old thing that got us $ 13 trillion into debt . 
5821	1479	But the pass the buck generation will lap PASS up . 
5822	1480	That 's as irresponsible a quote as DITCH have seen in this conservative dead-head thread . 
5823	1480	DITCH can quote again and again ALL the irresponsible machinations that the Republicans have thrust upon THAT since Saint Ronnie Reagan and come to fruition under Bratboy Bush , and not one conservative here or elsewhere will admit to the total and utter failure of `` trickle down war economics '' that put THAT in the deep economic `` ditch '' THAT 're now in . 
5824	1480	The entire Republican `` plan '' is `` just say NO !!!! '' 
5825	1480	to everything , even to those amendments JUST managed to put into every bill PLAN took Democrats to twist arms to get passed . 
5826	1480	The tea party is NOW the leader in everything Republican . 
5827	1480	And , JUST are totally out of JUST minds -- as if JUST ever had any ! 
5828	1480	Sharron Angle is so intolerant , temperate men would lament that she needs to get laid . 
5829	1480	Michelle Bachman could use a good lay as well . 
5830	1480	Even Saint Ronnie Reagan would balk at the intemperate rhetoric these two twisted witches spew from WITCHES brew ! 
5831	1480	Macbeth would shy from WITCHES acid laced tonic . 
5832	1480	Like Palin , these women use the Neoconservative poison that drips from the pen of William Kristol . 
5833	1480	Talk about a minion on Satan 's team ! 
5834	1480	SATAN demented economic ideology is what got us into 2 ill-begotten wars and a depression near the equal of that that was kicked off by the stock market crash in 1929 . 
5835	1480	-LRB- If US do n't pay attention to history , US are doomed to repeat IDEOLOGY ! -RRB- 
5836	1480	Obama has been in office less than 2 years and OBAMA 's supposed to clean up the godawful mess YEARS took Republicans 6 years and 2 wars to destroy the economy and the morale of the American people . 
5837	1480	Now Republicans want voters to give VOTERS the keys to the economy once again to send more jobs to China , force Americans to die rather than get needed health care and make sure that a quality education goes only to those who can pay for EDUCATION , like VOTERS billionaire cronies . 
5838	1480	Call that Un-American ? 
5839	1480	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ bet !!! 
5840	1480	!!! 's about as UN-American as !!! gets . 
5841	1480	`` All men are created equal to pursue life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness '' ? 
5842	1480	Not in this lifetime , so long as Republicans can deprive us of the `` dream ! '' 
5843	1480	in order to line their pockets with the gold from Chinese Communist banks . 
5844	1480	Will DITCH vote for Obama in 2010 . 
5846	1480	No Republican will get DITCH vote for as long as DITCH live -- and DITCH live in Texas ! 
5847	1480	God Forbid !!!! 
5848	1480	any Republican live as long as DITCH do . 
5849	1481	Why do ASPECT_CARTEROBAMAFANCLUB_ say that ? 
5850	1481	ummm ... czars anyone ? 
5851	1481	Firing auto CEO 's from the White House and handing over ownership of a company to a union ? 
5852	1481	What part of the constitution is Obama violating ? 
5853	1481	Was this CEO successful , asked to leave and CEO said , sure ? 
5854	1481	CONSTITUTION not like the bailout was given in a time of prosperity . 
5855	1481	If there was n't a problem we would n't be talking about this . 
5856	1481	About the bailouts -LRB- starting with Bush in 2008 -RRB- if ASPECT_CARTEROBAMAFANCLUB_ 're concerned about homeland security , WE are in the middle of a war on a few fronts : would allowing the chips fall where they may be a smart thing to do for this country ? 
5857	1481	And how would that affect the endless ways WE interact with the rest of the world ? 
5858	1481	Giving tax payer money without conditions and some management of what happens with that money -LRB- who where and what MONEY goes to -RRB- does n't make sense . 
5859	1481	MONEY would be worse than doing nothing 
5860	1484	well said ! 
5861	1485	Not nearly as bad as the Dems , and exactly what do ASPECT_IRIEMON_ think the current Administration is doing ? 
5862	1485	Running up debt into astronomical amounts . 
5863	1485	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ talk of the `` pass the buck '' generation ? 
5864	1485	Well , Obama is creating the `` pass the buck to THE generation '' . 
5865	1486	Obama restarted the paygo program . 
5866	1486	Obama is talking about raising taxes after the economy is recovered . 
5867	1486	Obama reformed the healthcare system to save us hundreds of billions . 
5868	1486	And Obama is ending the money pit that is the Iraq war . 
5869	1486	OBAMA 's doing great things for the deficit . 
5870	1486	The only reason the deficit is as high as DEFICIT is now is because REASON costs a lot of money to fix the mess the so called conservatives left . 
5871	1487	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ should put a warning label on ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ posts . 
5872	1487	`` Too much common sense and rational thought may cause cons heads to explode . '' 
5873	1488	So far , no attempt has been made to `` paygo . '' 
5874	1488	Unless ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ wish to count the $ 26 billion Teacher Stimulus which is to be paid for by taking money out of the FOOD STAMP PROGRAM . 
5876	1488	There must be a more wasteful program available to get that money , and 2 . 
5877	1488	PROGRAM WILL NEVER HAPPEN . 
5878	1488	Not a dime will be cut out of food stamps . 
5879	1488	The health care system has not been ` reformed ' SYSTEM has been further invaded by know-nothing bureaucrats and will cost TRILLIONS more than SYSTEM already does . 
5880	1488	Already the CBO says CBO will cost more than BUREAUCRATS estimated . 
5881	1488	Democrat candidates for Nov. are avoiding any mention of BHO or obamacare . 
5882	1488	The Iraq war is but a small fraction of our budget and the difference between `` Mission Accomplished , '' and `` Combat is over , '' is word choice only . 
5883	1488	The mission was not accomplished and combat is NOT over in Iraq . 
5884	1488	And blaming EXCUSE on the other guy is a completely worn out EXCUSE . 
5885	1488	And EXCUSE is purely an EXCUSE for a lack of accomplishment on BHO 's part . 
5886	1488	And what has BHO done for the deficit ? 
5887	1488	BHO HAS INCREASED THE NATIONAL DEBT BY $ 2.81 trillion in less than 2 years with BHO , and the Democrat controlled Congress , insane deficit spending . 
5888	1489	Obama started OBAMA presidential career with a 1.2 trillion dollar deficit . 
5889	1489	The latest prediction is that the 2010 deficit will be 1.3 trillion . 
5890	1489	That 's only a 100 billion dollar rise in the deficit . 
5891	1489	Which is astonishingly low considering the economy and the unavoidable rise in deficits that happens in every recession due to increased welfare costs . 
5892	1489	http:\/\/www.salon.com\/news\/feature\/20...dget_deficit_1In comparison by this time in Bush 's presidency Bush raised the deficit by 200 billion and BUSH was n't in a recession . 
5893	1489	In other words ... republicans are giant hypocrites . 
5894	1490	unemployment has not be rising for 14 straight months . 
5895	1490	MONTHS peaked a year ago and has been lower ever since . 
5896	1492	His constitutional authority does not allow HIS to create a shadow congress of czars , unelected and absolutely no oversight by anyone but the Emperor EMPEROR . 
5897	1492	HIS has no constitutional authority whatsoever to do anything with daily operations or ownership of a private corporation . 
5898	1492	Yet HIS gave ownership to union donors , fired a CEO that answers only to a private board , and made decisions on which dealerships to close directly from the White House , favoring supporters and dems . 
5899	1492	ASPECT_CANDACE_ excuses for this are mind-numbing . 
5900	1492	THIS 's essentially illegal , and without Pelosi , Reid , and a dem majority , impeachment would not be unrealistic . 
5901	1492	REID and Holder have no constitutional authority to stop legal actions against the club wielding thugs at the voting precinct . 
5902	1492	AUTHORITY 's like something out of Cuba or Venezuela . 
5903	1492	ASPECT_CANDACE_ 've got to be horrifically thick to try and pretend these things away . 
5904	1494	Could n't have sung it better myself . 
5905	1494	MYSELF like the sound of that tune . 
5906	1494	Play !!! again , Sam !!! 
5907	1495	Dr. Obama has never done anything unconstitutional . 
5908	1495	OBAMA cohorts in the legislative branch however continually find ways to violate Article 1 Section 8 of the USC . 
5909	1495	That is why we are in this economic mess today . 
5910	1496	I volunteer to take one for the team and sleep with Sarah Palin . 
5911	1497	Oh , WE sweetie pie tea party enthusiast , just like the Mad Hatter and in spite of ASPECT_CARTEROBAMAFANCLUB_ obvious paranoia , we `` love '' SPITE when ASPECT_CARTEROBAMAFANCLUB_ talk dirty ! 
5912	1497	Somebody needs a !!!! 
5913	1498	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ total rejoinder is a claim by a left wing website that he has a 1.3 TRILLION deficit ?? 
5914	1498	If Bush 's $ 1,2 trillion deficit was bad , AND BAD CERTAINLY WAS , how in hell is obummers $ 1.3 trillion deficit GOOD ? 
5915	1498	And please , do n't claim DEFICIT the Republican 's fault . 
5916	1498	That lamo EXCUSE is totally worn out , and the fact is the Democrats have been IN CHARGE since Jan. 2007 . 
5917	1498	The Republicans WERE awful , and were REPLACED in the Nov. 2006 elections and the Dems sworn in in Jan 2007 . 
5918	1498	Or did n't ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ know that . 
5919	1498	So the truly awful Republicans -LRB- no disagreement there -RRB- were replaced by the Democrats who HAVE DONE WORSE ! 
5920	1498	Pelosi , and Reid have been in CONGRESS for 20 + years and Biden even longer . 
5921	1498	What were they doing ? 
5922	1498	We NEED to dump career , and corrupt -LRB- same thing -RRB- politicians of both parties . 
5923	1498	The Republicans deserved to be replaced , AND WERE . 
5924	1498	Now the Democrats are even more deserving of being thrown out . 
5925	1498	Sadly that only leaves the Republicans to take the Democrats place , and POLITICIANS are looking LESS evil than the Dems . 
5926	1498	Both are BAD ! 
5927	1499	Pay her enough and HER 'll gladly accommodate anyone seeking HER favor . 
5928	1499	Just guard against STDs ! 
5929	1500	ASPECT_DAN40_ wanna know why 1.3 trillion is good ? 
5930	1500	because when we had a surplus G.W. cut taxes , increased spending , and took a machete to regulations . 
5931	1500	When Obama took office right after the http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?gl=IE&amp;h...&amp;v=mEkY7_i7MJs . 
5932	1500	Now , instead of raising taxes when WE had a surplus and the economy was good , SURPLUS was thrown away , dribbled into haliburton and the banks . 
5933	1500	Because the Bush tax cut for the rich expired 1.4 years into Obama 's term , it was meant to make BUSH look like BUSH was raising taxes in a time in recession when in fact it was just a ploy to make the democratic president , whoever CUT was look bad , because even Bush knew after the havic BUSH knew BUSH 'd create no republican would take office after HAVIC . 
5934	1500	So is Obama perfect ? 
5936	1500	Was OBAMA dealt a bad hand ? 
5937	1500	yes , YES had no where but down to go , and without spending for stimulous we 'd keep going down . 
5938	1500	Is Obama doing what truly needs to be done to fix WE broken system of government feeding the rich who gamle WE money away ? 
5939	1500	no , but honestly OBAMA think republicans would be even worse , historically speaking than the man in office now . 
5940	1501	Maybe ASPECT_DAN40_ have a point . 
5941	1501	But , just `` maybe . '' 
5942	1501	If BOTH are BAD , what 's ASPECT_DAN40_ solution ? 
5943	1501	Another party ? 
5944	1501	I 'll buy that , but who do ASPECT_DAN40_ recommend ? 
5945	1501	The tea party ? 
5946	1501	Not even Osama bin Laden would finance that group of rattlesnakes -LRB- Do n't tread on I ! -RRB- 
5947	1501	and LADEN has incentive to do so since electing them is the same as electing LADEN . 
5948	1501	Sorry , that dog wo n't hunt ! 
5949	1501	Seriously , if the Republicans could muster a `` real '' American candidate , as an Independent , I might vote for him\/her . 
5950	1501	But , THEM got no one ! 
5951	1501	All Republicans do is whine , complain , lie and say , `` NO ! '' 
5952	1501	Them 's the facts , Danny boy . 
5953	1501	Them 's the facts ! 
5954	1501	They shot THEY in the foot with Bratboy Bush -- or should I cite Cheney as the shooter ? 
5955	1501	Now , all THEY can do is hobble around on crutches blaming Obama for THEY inability to run the marathon without tea party help . 
5956	1501	Ohhhhhhhh , the pain of NOW all ! 
5957	1502	There is no Tea Party like a Democrat Party or Republican Party . 
5958	1502	Tea Party is a misnomer taken from the Boston tea party of history . 
5959	1502	The tea party is NOT a political party . 
5960	1502	MOVEMENT is a groundswell movement of many DIVERSE groups with only a few things in common with one another . 
5961	1502	Out of Control Govt spending and the National Debt would be 2 complaints that most tea party groups have in common . 
5962	1502	How to fix those things and many , many others are points of disagreement in the various tea parties , same as MANY are in society in general . 
5963	1502	Now some have used the name Tea Party for SOME own political purposes and gain . 
5964	1502	But the ` tea party ' is really a dissatisfied American public . 
5965	1504	No I wont , he does not have a clue , never ran a small business , which is prevalent in congress , NO have no idea what BUSINESS takes and how the small business population creates jobs and invest in the economy ... Just more of the same , Democrats have been in power in congress since 2006 , NO persuaded Bush to pass NO bills , look where BUSINESS has taken us ! 
5966	1504	Bush got too mushy during BUSH last four years with Pelosi in power , I wonder why ? 
5967	1504	US are screwed for quite sometime with the economy , unfortunately ! 
5968	1504	Mostly because Obama is just doing the same , Pelosi must be quite convincing ... Jolleel 
5969	1505	if by groundswell ASPECT_DAN40_ mean a fox news movement then yes ... the next few years are going to suck , but the reps have no one right now . 
5970	1505	Ron Paul 2012 ? 
5971	1506	I agree with Dan40 , he has defined the ground roots movement ... Jollee 
5972	1507	IF ASPECT_SHAKER154_ truly believe that a single CABLE TV station can sway the thinking of an entire nation while all OTHER media outlets are condemning FOX and presenting a completely different scenario , ASPECT_SHAKER154_ , like most all liberals have drank ASPECT_SHAKER154_ Kool-Aid until ASPECT_SHAKER154_ are blind , deaf , and dumb -LRB- as in stupid -RRB- One CABLE station , and EVERYONE does not have cable , has more power than all the other media combined ??? 
5973	1507	ASPECT_SHAKER154_ are being completely silly and illogical . 
5974	1507	The TRUTH is that THIS nation is fed up with the miserably incompetent , corrupt Chicago Cabal running the White House . 
5975	1507	And TRUTH IS disgustingly obvious to all with working MINDS that obummers ideological nonsense `` fixes '' have not worked and will not work . 
5976	1507	All of the nation , but Kool-Aid drunken liberals , can see and know that is the FACT of the USA today . 
5977	1507	And IF ASPECT_SHAKER154_ truly believe what ASPECT_SHAKER154_ 're saying , then the Nov. elections are going to be much , much worse for the liberals and that is not good . 
5978	1507	When the Republicans win and LIBERALS WILL , NOV. should only be by a tiny margin , otherwise LIBERALS can go just as crazy as the liberal Democrats did . 
5979	1507	Republicans will win in Nov. but we 've got to have LIBERALS think LIBERALS 're on thin ice too . 
5980	1511	Do n't forget to kill American jobs and help along outsourcing . 
5981	1511	Those are Republican ideals . 
5982	1512	November 's coming friend ! 
5983	1512	The DemWits have really been in charge of Congress since 2006 ... . 
5984	1512	Four years of crap , can cause significant damage , bush was too nice to Nancy Pelosi , the big spender ... Jollee 
5985	1513	Jollee , ASPECT_JOLLEE_ right and they know RIGHT , THEY also know THEY voted for the war . 
5986	1513	Not to mention screwing the economy with THEY great house give a way . 
5987	1513	Nowthey admit , , , Oh those people could not afford those homes ... DUH !!!! 
5988	1513	How did PEOPLE finally figure that out ? 
5989	1513	My God a small business man like MY has seen the poor do the dumbest things time and time again . 
5990	1513	MY have had to sit with clients -LRB- car Ins -RRB- , and tell CLIENTS . 
5992	1513	Dont get MY wrong MY will make money if ASPECT_JOLLEE_ buy this new Mercedes , , , but but , , ASPECT_JOLLEE_ could not make payments on ASPECT_JOLLEE_ 98 Chevy , , how are ASPECT_JOLLEE_ going to do this , , , -LRB- answer every time -RRB- ... ... ... Gee Dave , MY have no idea ... These are the very same people our Government is not smart enough to figure out , that 's down right scary . 
5993	1513	Know what ? 
5994	1513	, MY dont think PEOPLE are that dumb , everything the Dems do keep these people in poverty . 
5995	1514	My guess is that when the Dems get a whoppin in Nov. . 
5996	1514	The DNC will DUMP obama and start looking for a viable candidate for 2012 . 
5997	1514	Already all the Dems up for re-election are treating obama like CANDIDATE has the Plague . 
5998	1514	CANDIDATE shows up for a fund raiser and the local candidate is `` out of town . '' 
5999	1514	DEMS the POTUS , and the candidate is `` out of town ? '' 
6000	1514	Now THAT `` S funny ! 
6001	1514	Some fund raising dinners with obama have had the prices dropped by 90 + % and one they gave tickets away to fill the joint . 
6002	1514	This is the guy ASPECT_SMOKEJUMPER_ want to vote for . 
6003	1514	GUY own political hacks do n't want anything to do with GUY . 
6004	1514	GUY will go down in history as the longest any president was a `` lame duck . 
6005	1514	`` GUY came in a Messiah , GUY 's going out a Pariah ! 
6006	1516	Bush 8 years of crap on the American public . 
6007	1516	Maybe YEARS 's that Republican math ASPECT_JOLLEE_ 're using ... all emotional but nothing rational . 
6008	1518	NEWS FLASH !!! 
6009	1518	NEWS FLASH !!! 
6010	1518	NEWS FLASH !!! 
6011	1518	Since January 2007 , PARTY has been the Democratic Party in control of the Congress AND SPENDING . 
6012	1519	Obama is not following the paygo program . 
6013	1519	Obama wants to raise taxes now , before the economy recovers , Obamacare will do anything but save money , and OBAMA is doing things to increase the deficit . 
6014	1519	The only thing that has happened so far that will save us money , was the draw-down of Iraq . 
6015	1519	However , much of that expense is just being shifted to Afghanistan . 
6016	1519	The reason the deficit is getting so high , is because Obama and OBAMA Democratic goons are spending US into oblivion . 
6018	1521	Most of our current deficit came from programs that were started prior to 2007 . 
6019	1521	Like the Iraq War and the Bush tax cuts . 
6020	1522	NUMBER 's not good . 
6021	1522	NUMBER 's still a bad number . 
6022	1522	The thing that IS good is that he is moving up at a much slower rate and is passing policies that will eventually drive the deficit down . 
6023	1522	I gaurantee ... mark I word ... that 2011 's deficit will be lower than the 1.2 trillion HE started with . 
6024	1522	Because democratic policies and only democratic policies lower the deficit . 
6025	1522	If ASPECT_DAN40_ want a deficit that is higher than 1.2 trillion dollars then vote Republican in 2010 and 2012 . 
6026	1522	Because that 's all republicans are good for . 
6027	1523	Obama has not proposed any such program of raising taxes before the recovery is over . 
6028	1524	He 's letting the Bush tax cuts expire . 
6029	1524	HE may agree to keep them in place for middle America , however , but small business will suffer . 
6030	1524	Many tax increases come into play on 1\/1\/2011 due to Obamacare . 
6031	1524	Cap & Trade : Tax Increases , energy increases = increase in the cost of goods and services . 
6032	1524	Report : Obama 's tax increase on oil and gas would cost thousands of jobs : President Obama 's proposed tax increases on oil and gas companies would cause over 154,000 workers to lose THOUSANDS jobs , according to a new report by Louisiana State University economist Dr. Joseph Mason . 
6033	1524	The report also finds that Obama 's proposal would reduce economic output by $ 341 billion and create over $ 68 billion in lost wages nationwide . 
6034	1524	`` Though politicians think POLITICIANS are selectively targeting ` Big Oil ' with these energy tax proposals , POLITICIANS would actually devastate thousands of small American businesses nationwide as well as the workers who depend on POLITICIANS , '' Mason said in prepared remarks . 
6035	1524	`` With at least 150,000 U.S. jobs at stake in fields ranging from healthcare to real estate 150,000 's clear that the cost of repealing Section 199 and dual capacity far outweigh the potential benefit of increased government revenues that may be derived from the proposal . 
6036	1524	`` Obama recently proposed paying for OBAMA $ 50 billion plan to improve the country 's infrastructure system by increasing taxes on the oil and gas industry . 
6037	1524	Mason points out that if Congress follows through on MASON plan , the effect might be worse than MASON calculations because MASON estimates do not include how individual investors would be affected by the tax increase . 
6038	1524	Source : http:\/\/thehill.com\/blogs\/on-the-mone...s-to-lose-jobsLieberman throws cold water on Obama 's tax proposal : Writers on the left end of the spectrum seemed buoyed by would-be Speaker John Boehner 's statement over the weekend that OBAMA party could , in fact , support President Barack Obama and the Democrats on a partial extension of the Bush-era tax cuts . 
6039	1524	The Obama position - the same one endorsed back home by members of the Congressional delegation and candidates like Attorney General Richard Blumenthal - is that the income tax cuts should be extended for people making less than $ 250,000 per year , as well as for businesses . 
6040	1524	The only cuts that would be allowed to expire as scheduled would be those on people making $ 250,000 per year or more , or roughly 2 percent of taxpayers . 
6041	1524	TPM has the exchange , from `` Face the Nation '' : Bob Schieffer : `` SCHIEFFER want to make sure SCHIEFFER heard what ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ said correctly : ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ 're saying that ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ are willing to vote for those middle class tax cuts , even though the bill will not include ... extending the tax cuts for the upper bracket American . '' 
6042	1524	Rep. Boehner : `` Bob , ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ do n't know what the bill 's going to say , alright ? 
6043	1524	If the only option BOEHNER have is to vote for those at 250 and below , of course BOEHNER 'm going to do that . 
6044	1524	But BOEHNER 'm going to do everything BOEHNER can to fight to make sure that ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ extend the current tax rates for all Americans . 
6045	1524	`` That certainly looks like the President winning a game of chicken with the Republican minority , especially given that Democratic members of Congress -LRB- Rep. Joe Courtney , for example -RRB- have lately sounded resigned to the likelihood that MEMBERS will have to vote to extend all the cuts , even on the rich , since doing nothing would result in hiking taxes on the middle class . 
6046	1524	And since Republicans , by simply folding MEMBERS arms and saying no to anything but the full slate of tax cuts , would force Democrats to choose between extending a boon for multimillionaires or delivering nothing and handing MULTIMILLIONAIRES opponents another club to use in the fall campaigns . 
6047	1524	Why would Boehner blink ? 
6048	1524	Perhaps because , as with so many other issues in the last year , the Senate will carry the day . 
6049	1524	Today , here 's Sen. Joe Lieberman , a registered Democrat who makes a lot of registered Democrats see red , explaining that LIEBERMAN 'll be holding out for the same thing Boehner is : extending the cuts for everybody . 
6050	1524	More : http:\/\/www.theday.com\/article\/201009...0403\/100919940 
6051	1528	FACT 's an economic fact that the poor and middle class put money into the economy faster than the rich . 
6052	1528	The rich do put a lot in savings . 
6053	1528	They invest too but those investments do n't always see THEY trickling down to the common man . 
6054	1528	Hell there is no guarantee that money is going to American interests . 
6055	1528	THEY could be investing in a company based in London or China . 
6056	1528	Plus in an environment where demand is low ... like ... in a recession ... THEY are n't going to risk the money to expand operations when demand does n't warrant RECESSION . 
6057	1528	We gave the rich a tax cut and instead of growing WE lost millions of jobs . 
6058	1528	But when WE raised taxes on MILLIONS and cut taxes for the middle class and gave the middle class temporary work MILLIONS spent that extra money . 
6059	1528	Now demand is up . 
6060	1528	Businesses are profiting again . 
6061	1528	And the private sector is hiring . 
6062	1528	SECTOR 's clear which strategy works and which does not . 
6063	1529	What brainwashed BS . 
6064	1529	Economies grow through INVESTMENTS , not through spending . 
6065	1529	And the only job growth under the dummy oBum has been in Govt jobs . 
6066	1529	Since OBUM was elected private sector jobs are a net loss . 
6067	1529	And if the taxes are increased on people making over $ 250,000 . 
6068	1529	LOSS will bring the 2011 deficit down from $ 1.27 trillion to $ 1.07 trillion -LRB- CBO -RRB- LOSS will TAKE $ 200 billion out of the economy and put LOSS in the hands of politicians , WHERE LOSS WILL BE MOSTLY WASTED . 
6069	1529	Reduced Govt spending by a mere 5 % and we would be in the exact same place and the $ 200 billion would stay in the economy where SPENDING can do good . 
6070	1530	Actually the only group of jobs growing right now is private sector . 
6071	1530	The government is laying people off because of the census ending . 
6072	1530	And we 'll be just fine with raised taxes . 
6073	1530	WE already have rediculiously low taxes . 
6074	1530	Here is a concept . 
6075	1530	WHY DO N'T WE PAY OUR BILLS !? 
6076	1531	Private sector jobs are growing SLIGHTLY right now . 
6077	1531	What I said is that private sector jobs are a net loss under the incompetent one . 
6078	1531	He BLEW $ 814 billion on the failed Stimulus , and immediately after STIMULUS passed , HE IGNORED the economy for over a year in order to concentrate on the most horrendous bill ever passed in the history of the country , obummercare . 
6079	1531	And is constantly distracted by tiny minor issues like a cop and prof in Mass. or the Sherrod fiasco , which was 100 % COP fault . 
6080	1531	And other distractions like the oil spill go unnoticed for months before COP can find time for them . 
6081	1531	COP can not handle a full plate all at once . 
6082	1531	COP has a decision making process that can only kindly be called ` confused , ' and COP has n't a clue how to judge people . 
6083	1531	The White House staff has 41 people owing the Govt over $ 800,000.00 in unpaid taxes , and a Treasury Secretary that could n't figure out COP own individual taxes . 
6084	1531	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ say , `` WHY DO N'T WE PAY OUR BILLS !? '' 
6085	1531	How about first put that $ 800,000 . 
6086	1531	in the Treasury or CUT those Govt jobs and get people in there with integrity and honor .2012 ca n't come too soon to bid good riddance to this idiot . 
6087	1532	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ have to wonder whether the cognitive dissonance among our conservative friends will lead to mass neurosis . 
6088	1532	In one minute the deficits and debt are the worst problems in the world , but when presented with a plan to reduce the deficits by increasing revenues , FRIENDS blow a fuse . 
6089	1533	He ignored the economy by passing a $ 800 billion stimulus to stimulate the economy ? 
6090	1533	See point re : mass neurosis in above post . 
6091	1534	A STIMULUS that did not stimulate , and was ignored since the day he signed STIMULUS . 
6092	1534	From then on THEN complete agenda was passing an unwanted and unwise health care bill , while the economy was ignored . 
6093	1534	The `` stimulus '' STILL has BILLIONS unspent a year and a half later . 
6094	1534	How does STILL `` stimulate '' if STILL is not spent ? 
6095	1534	And why does THEN need MORE `` stimulus '' money when 40 &#37; of THE STIMULUS is still on the books ? 
6096	1534	IF MONEY was a good idea . 
6097	1534	And IF MONEY was an emergency . 
6098	1534	WHY is more needed when the `` emergency funds '' have yet to `` stimulate '' anything and remain UNSPENT ?? 
6099	1534	Asking questions of an administration that does not EVER make any sense is not neurosis , ADMINISTRATION is the responsibility of every citizen . 
6100	1534	Even a Govt that DOES make sense should be questioned by a responsible citizenry . 
6101	1534	But liberals ca n't stand questions since ASPECT_IRIEMON_ have no logical , provable answers . 
6102	1535	Thank for sharing ASPECT_DAN40_ opinions . 
6103	1535	ASPECT_DAN40_ 've already made them clear . 
6104	1535	I disagree with THEM for reasons stated mulitple times . 
6105	1535	I never suggested the neurosis was questioning the administration . 
6106	1535	But in screeching about deficits while at the same time going apoplectic over the plan to reduce THEM . 
6107	1536	Since obama is deficit spending at the highest rate in history . 
6108	1536	If fact OUTSPENDING about 95 % of our total history . 
6109	1536	I have to say that whatever the plan is to reduce deficits , PLAN is not working . 
6110	1536	While there is very little chance that Republican incumbents will do anything to reduce OUR national debt . 
6111	1536	There is absolutely NO chance whatsoever that Democrats will do anything to reduce the debt . 
6112	1537	There has been no plan to reduce deficits to this point . 
6113	1537	Only to keep the economy from going into another great depression . 
6114	1537	There is nothing to gauge whether ECONOMY working . 
6115	1537	Increasing tax revenues would be a step in the right direction . 
6116	1537	What 's the Republican plan ? 
6117	1538	Dozens have been offered , that DOZENS bounce off ASPECT_IRIEMON_ closed liberal mind is not the issue . 
6118	1538	Many have been offered . 
6119	1538	That does not mean I believe MANY . 
6120	1538	Same as I did not and do not believe the sincerity of a statement made last year by the POTUS , one barak h obama when POTUS said `` ASPECT_IRIEMON_ DO NOT raise taxes in a recession . '' 
6121	1538	It was a politically expedient LIE when POTUS said SINCERITY last year and POTUS insistence on raising taxes on people making over $ 200,000 , or households making $ 250,000.00 is a politically expedient LIE now . 
6122	1538	ANY statement that POTUS thinks will help POTUS politically , POTUS will utter . 
6123	1538	No matter how much POTUS believes LIE to be a lie or not . 
6124	1538	POTUS knows the brain damaged liberals will believe LIE because POTUS says LIE . 
6125	1538	Republicans will not believe POTUS . 
6126	1538	Conservatives will not believe POTUS . 
6127	1538	But best of all INDEPENDENTS have reached the wiser point of no longer believing POTUS . 
6128	1538	And independents is where the votes are . 
6129	1539	ASPECT_DAN40_ can act like ASPECT_DAN40_ for the middle class , but if ASPECT_DAN40_ not for the job creators in this economy ASPECT_DAN40_ not for middle class jobs ! 
6131	1540	CUTTING spending is the FIRST step in the right direction . 
6132	1540	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ liberals grant oBum the excuse that he HAD to spend like HE does . 
6133	1540	Well that same excuse could be made in every minute , by every politician in the last 50 years and more . 
6134	1540	Some `` pet '' agenda of theirs is ALWAYS ` necessary . 
6135	1540	` We already have 50 % too much Federal Govt NOW . 
6136	1540	Step one is to cut that back , along with the massive expense too much Govt generatesThe average private sector job , where 100 % of all WE goods are produced , pays $ 63,000 . 
6137	1540	with benefits . 
6138	1540	The average Federal employee job , where nothing is produced , pays $ 121,000 . 
6139	1540	with benefits . 
6140	1540	That should make JOB obvious to EVEN a liberal that cutting the Govt is a better way to go than taxing the private sector . 
6141	1540	Since the private sector already has to pay every cent of that $ 121,000 . 
6142	1540	Federal largess . 
6143	1541	So ASPECT_DAN40_ are -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- ing about deficits , but wo n't support raising revenues to reduce \* . 
6144	1541	Typical hypocritical conservative political bull -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- . 
6145	1542	`` Typical hypocritical conservative political bull ? 
6146	1542	`` $ 63K to $ 121K and ASPECT_IRIEMON_ want to give them more money ? 
6147	1542	Typical liberal lunacy AND BULLSH ! 
6148	1542	TI am 100 % for having revenues to support the Govt . 
6149	1542	As soon as the Govt is reduced to a proper size , we can increase taxes for the express purpose of paying down the debt . 
6150	1542	Increase taxes without decreasing Govt , and WE will ONLY get MORE spending . 
6151	1542	They 're spending money THEY do n't HAVE like drunken sailors . 
6152	1542	What would THEY do with more money ?? 
6153	1542	Increase the Federal revenues by 10 % and THEY 'll spend 12 % more than now . 
6154	1542	CUTS FIRST , then we 'll KNOW what the taxes NEED to be . 
6156	1543	`` Cut spending . '' 
6157	1543	Being hearing that from conservatives for 3 decades . 
6158	1543	CONSERVATIVES talk but never do HEARING . 
6159	1543	There is n't one -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- conservative politician today who is saying where CONSERVATIVES 're going to cut $ 500 billion in spending . 
6160	1543	In the meantime keep those tax cuts and keep running up debt . 
6161	1543	All that conservative whining about deficits is nothing but hypocritical political horse -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- . 
6162	1544	Says someone who is on food stamps\/bridge card . 
6163	1544	Why do n't I pay ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ bills instead of having someone else pay for them . 
6164	1544	I find PAY comical ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ are -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- ing about others paying THEM bills when ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ do n't even pay ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ . 
6165	1544	Typical liberal college kid . 
6166	1545	I do pay I bills . 
6167	1545	And I am proud I am on food stamps . 
6168	1545	Otherwise I would n't be able to afford to bring business to I local brewery . 
6169	1545	Food stamps help the economy . 
6170	1546	So ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ are worried about buying beer ? 
6172	1546	Receiving food stamps is not paying ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ bills . 
6173	1546	Somebody else -LRB- the taxpayer -RRB- is . 
6174	1546	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ should be thanking the taxpayer . 
6175	1547	Thank ASPECT_JTHORP24_ , taxpayers . 
6176	1547	By funding the food stamps program ASPECT_JTHORP24_ help me not only afford to eat but use ME money elsewhere to support small local businesses . 
6177	1547	Which include breweries and video game stores . 
6178	1547	Those extra businesses now have ME money when TAXPAYERS would n't have before . 
6179	1547	Thanks to ASPECT_JTHORP24_ taxpayers 
6180	1548	AND there is n't one liberal politician that does n't want to increase taxes ON EVERYONE and increase spending on everything . 
6181	1548	Do n't ASPECT_IRIEMON_ ever notice my signature ? 
6182	1548	We have to get the politicians out of politics . 
6183	1548	Term limits are NECESSARY for the survival of the country . 
6184	1548	POLITICIANS of both parties got WE where WE are . 
6185	1548	WE need the constant change of real people to get WE out . 
6186	1549	Change is n't always good . 
6187	1549	The change we took in 2000 was a disaster . 
6188	1550	And then we went from bad to worse in 2008 . 
6189	1550	That is also what is currently on the plate . 
6190	1550	Blame Bush ai n't working out so well anymore for the one-trick-pony dopes , now is NOW . 
6191	1551	2000 was bad , but only a warm up to the total disaster of 2008 . 
6192	1552	Yup , I noticed that too . 
6193	1554	Bush was president in 2008 . 
6194	1554	I agree 2008 went from bad to worse . 
6195	1554	Things started turning around in 2009 . 
6196	1555	Yup , I noticed that too . 
6197	1555	Obama was elected in 2008 , not 2000 . 
6198	1555	Check ASPECT_TAXPAYER_ history books . 
6199	1556	but the stimulus is wearing out and soon the economy and the stock markets will both be heading south ! 
6200	1557	Sure thing . 
6201	1557	When 's `` soon '' ? 
6202	1558	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ assumptions are incorrect . 
6203	1558	I was commenting on and agreeing with ASPECT_IRIEMON_ first sentence , not ASPECT_IRIEMON_ second . 
6204	1558	A hint could be found in I quoting ASPECT_IRIEMON_ first sentence , not ASPECT_IRIEMON_ second . 
6206	1559	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ are spending someone else 's money on needs . 
6207	1559	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ are spending ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ own money on things ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ do n't need -LRB- wants -RRB- . 
6208	1559	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ are justifying taking someone else 's money so ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ can buy beer and video games , classic liberal . 
6210	1560	I am justifying getting food stamps so I can afford to buy things other than just food . 
6211	1560	As such I am helping the economy more than I would be if I was n't on food stamps and only spending money on food . 
6212	1560	I have great pride in I decision to get food stamps because I am helping America get back on track . 
6213	1560	If more of our nation 's poor took advantage of government assistance programs designed specifically for them then then even more businesses would benefit . 
6214	1560	Demand would go up . 
6215	1560	And businesses would be forced to expand to make up for the new demand . 
6216	1560	Which means more jobs which ultimately means less people dependent on food stamps . 
6217	1560	Food stamps also allows I to be independent from I parents . 
6218	1560	Who ca n't afford to take care of I . 
6219	1560	Which means PARENTS too can spend money on things like paying off PARENTS mortgage so PARENTS do n't become another foreclosure statistic . 
6220	1560	Thank god food stamps exist so that people like I who struggle with academics and require lots of time studying can afford to go to school and eat at the same time . 
6221	1561	What total rationalizing bullcrap , ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ are doing NOTHING for the economy . 
6222	1561	The money ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ 're using to buy things `` other than food '' is not doing anything extra for the economy . 
6223	1561	Because someone earned that money AND the right to spend MONEY as they wished , but it was taken from THEY in the form of taxes to buy food stamps for ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ . 
6224	1561	As my signature says , 2 people spending one person 's money DOES NOT help the economy . 
6225	1564	I quoted the wrong post LOLYou are sounding like the non-believers that thought the housing bubble would go on forever ! 
6226	1565	true but mass hysteria also creates crises and positive people live longer anyway ... PEOPLE just do n't have as much money ... 
6227	1566	Instead of taking food stamps and then spending ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ time surfing the web explaining how in a round about way ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ are helping the economy , ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ could simply go out and get a job . 
6228	1566	My parents said PARENTS could n't afford to keep MY under PARENTS roof forever , so MY decided to go to college so MY could get a job and MAKE MY OWN MONEY . 
6229	1566	There is no way ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ can say that getting a job and then spending the money from that job is not helping the economy . 
6230	1568	Not at all . 
6231	1568	I had opportunities by buy real estate in the 2005-07 time frame and would n't touch ESTATE . 
6232	1568	ASPECT_BACARDI_ are sounding like the non-believers that think the gold bubble will go on forever ! 
6233	1569	Food stamps would n't exist if REASON did n't benefit businesses . 
6234	1569	That 's the whole reason we still have food stamps . 
6235	1569	To allow WE poor to spend money on things POOR would n't be able to afford otherwise at minimal cost to businesses . 
6236	1569	I am indeed helping the economy 
6237	1570	I 'm glad ASPECT_COMMONSENSE184_ could handle a full time job and full time school at the same time . 
6238	1570	I can not . 
6239	1570	When I tried I GPA plummeted . 
6240	1570	A job at some fast food place is n't as important to I as getting through college . 
6241	1570	So I choose not to work . 
6242	1570	Just like plenty of other college students . 
6243	1570	And there is nothing wrong with PLENTY . 
6244	1570	The government will be taking way more in taxes from I after I graduate than the amount I get in food stamps . 
6245	1570	Also I would not be able to get through college without this assistance . 
6246	1570	Which means I would n't be able to make the high salary I plan to achieve after I graduate . 
6247	1570	Which means the government would be missing out on hundreds of thousands of tax dollars during I career . 
6248	1570	So yes . 
6249	1570	on many factors getting food stamps is helping the economy . 
6250	1570	Not only the business end but END is helping END to gain more revenue in the future . 
6251	1571	And thanks to those food stamps I can afford to go to college to get a high salary job which will have high taxes which will be used to pay for some other college kid 's food stamps . 
6252	1571	JOB 's an economic fact that more money is pumped into the economy thanks to food stamps than the program MONEY costs . 
6253	1571	That 's why there is n't a politician in their right mind suggesting we get rid of JOB . 
6254	1571	Only conservatives who do n't understand how economics work . 
6255	1573	A lot of truth in that . 
6256	1573	Like most things , LOT 's a matter of incentives . 
6257	1573	Politicians have an incentive to give people what POLITICIANS want and American 's consistently want more than PEOPLE can afford . 
6258	1573	As long as politicians are allowed to borrow money , the inevitable result is short term patches , snowballing debt , and an eventual crash . 
6259	1574	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ really think those tax dollars `` pumped into '' the economy would n't have been spent had the government not forcibly taken them from people in order to give ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ the privilege of spending someone else 's money ? 
6260	1574	The reason politicians do n't shut down this type of forced charity is not because of some greater economic good , GOOD 's because more voters want a free ride than are being abused by our tax system . 
6261	1574	POLITICIANS keep TYPE going to get votes , stay in office , and collect an unearned paycheck . 
6262	1574	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ can , but odds are ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ wo n't . 
6263	1574	The fact that the height of ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ ambition is to get a salary rather than trying to really make an impact on the economy suggests ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ 'll never pay enough in taxes to even equal what ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ take out of the government much less help someone else . 
6264	1575	An economic fact that more money is pumped into the economy thanks to food stamps , than the program costs . 
6265	1575	That is not only a blatant lie , LIE is also impossible . 
6266	1575	LIE can not pump anything IN after the same program took the money OUT of the economy . 
6267	1575	Believe the liberal bullsh ! 
6268	1575	t if ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ wish or make up nonsense as ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ go along . 
6269	1575	I went to college working 2 jobs , 1 full time , 1 part time . 
6270	1575	AND had a wife and 2 kids . 
6271	1575	No food stamps , no welfare , we provided WE own help . 
6272	1575	WELFARE called personal responsibility and pride , or at least WELFARE used to be . 
6273	1575	But I 'm guessing ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ do n't really know anything about that . 
6274	1576	He does n't . 
6275	1576	IF money were truly that big of an issue to HE HE would go to a much cheaper college and save money . 
6276	1576	I 'm tired of this liberal bullsh ! 
6277	1576	t that `` I ca n't work because I need time to study . '' 
6278	1576	That 's a bunch of non-sense . 
6279	1576	There is always plenty of time to study . 
6280	1576	Also , once ASPECT_DAN40_ get a job and go to school , ASPECT_DAN40_ find ways to better manage ASPECT_DAN40_ time I have realized . 
6281	1576	But , of course , he needs money for video games 
6282	1577	Back in those days there were times when I was dead dog tired . 
6283	1577	I had 2 sayings that I would repeat in I head . 
6284	1577	One from I Dad , `` The more ASPECT_JTHORP24_ carry in ASPECT_JTHORP24_ head , the less ASPECT_JTHORP24_ 'll have to carry on ASPECT_JTHORP24_ back . '' 
6285	1577	And one of my own , `` The more ASPECT_JTHORP24_ do , the more ASPECT_JTHORP24_ can do . 
6286	1577	`` And with age , ASPECT_JTHORP24_ 've found that the opposite of mine is also true , `` The more ASPECT_JTHORP24_ sit , the more ASPECT_JTHORP24_ have to sit . '' 
6288	1578	ASPECT_TAXPAYER_ 're wrong . 
6289	1578	Food stamps do benefit the economy . 
6290	1578	This is an economic fact . 
6291	1578	http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2008\/01\/29\/news...ysis\/index.htmhttp:\/\/www2.hickoryrecord.com\/news\/2...nomy-ar-89482\/http:\/\/www.stateline.org\/live\/detail...ntentId=401013It is a general trend of capitalism for money to get stuck in high income families . 
6292	1578	Wealth just moves TREND 's way up and once ONCE gets there ONCE does not come back down . 
6293	1578	Wealthy business owners only spend enough to make more money . 
6294	1578	OWNERS do not hire just because OWNERS have extra money lying around . 
6295	1578	Because if OWNERS did that OWNERS might lose money if OWNERS are more productive than OWNERS demand warrants . 
6296	1578	So the money gets put in a bank . 
6297	1578	Or an inheritance fund . 
6298	1578	Or some other place where FUND just sits and makes more money on interest or dividends . 
6299	1578	Sure some of PLACE might `` trickle down '' but PLACE goes up many times faster than PLACE comes down . 
6300	1578	The income tax was designed from the start to balance this issue out . 
6301	1578	TAX was designed to take money from those who are n't spending TAX and are instead hording TAX to make more money for THOSE . 
6302	1578	That money then goes to programs to assist lower income families . 
6303	1578	Whether through food , education , healthcare , or just putting a little extra money in FAMILIES pockets . 
6304	1578	This in turn creates more consumers , which means more demand , which forces employers to hire more , which makes businesses sell more product . 
6305	1578	SYSTEM 's a delicate economic system that ensures everyone gets a piece of the pie . 
6306	1578	Some might get bigger pieces but at least everyone is eating pie . 
6307	1578	This system keeps our economy healthy . 
6308	1578	Taking those taxes away only insures the rich get richer and the poor gets poorer . 
6309	1579	I 'm glad ASPECT_DAN40_ could . 
6310	1579	MAN 're a better man than I . 
6311	1579	I had two choices . 
6312	1579	Work a job and still make barely enough to feed I while watching I GPA drop below 2.5 ... or focus all I efforts on school get on government assistance and watch I GPA go to 3.3 . 
6314	1579	The choice is clear . 
6315	1579	3.3 is a way nicer GPA . 
6316	1579	And I 'm not going to sacrifice that so I can make minimum wage when I 'm doing just fine living off food stamps and loans . 
6317	1579	It means I 'll be in more debt when I get out of school . 
6318	1579	But I 'll have an easier time finding a job because of I GPA and the fact that I had time to be the president of a student organization . 
6319	1580	I went to community college for 2 years to get all I gen eds out of the way for basically free -LRB- state paid I way -RRB- . 
6320	1580	And I am currently enrolled in one of the cheapest 4 year universities in the state . 
6321	1581	And Bush and oBum both have spent like drunken idiots and the economy is in perfect shape for all IDIOTS Govt spending . 
6322	1581	Liberals are lunatics that think something can be made from nothing . 
6323	1583	-LRB- -LRB- -LRB- Mod edit : Insult removed -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- To liberals , any disagreement with obummer 's FAILED policies and obvious incompetence as a leader and a thinker MEANS without a doubt the opponent is a RACIST . 
6324	1583	That 's all ASPECT_SASSY_ got . 
6325	1583	I 've got the continuing flat economy . 
6326	1583	The continuing high unemployment . 
6327	1583	The continuing avoidance of the real issues . 
6328	1583	The continuing poor hiring . 
6329	1583	The continuing poor housing sales . 
6330	1583	The continuing growing foreclosures . 
6331	1583	And the continuing disapproval by the MAJORITY of the American Public . 
6332	1583	The same American public that elected him has suddenly become RACIST ? 
6333	1583	ASPECT_SASSY_ people are lost in worthless dreamland . 
6334	1584	I never realized we could get to a point that a person could make charity sound like they are doing WE a favor , , HOLY CRAP !!!! 
6337	1585	When Bush left office in January of 2009 , the nation wide unemployment was 7.2 percent and the average price of a gallon of gasoline in the USA was about $ 1.65 . 
6338	1585	After Spender-N-Chief Obama took the oath of office the nation wide unemployment peaked over 10 percent in October not to mention the fact that 2 + million jobs lost under a Blueneck President . 
6339	1585	President Obama : Chains we can believe in ! 
6340	1586	When Bush left office the economy was tanking at -7 % real rate and a net 700,000 jobs were being lost each month . 
6341	1586	Only our conservative friends could find that hilarious . 
6342	1587	One of the most perverse assertions I 've ever heard , too often repeated by those who are unable to earn the lifestyle they demand . 
6343	1587	More accurately , wealth moves from those that consume much and produce little to those that consume less less than THOSE produce . 
6344	1587	This is n't a flaw in capitalism , FLAW is n't about money getting `` stuck . '' 
6345	1587	FLAW happens because some participants in our economy provide insufficient value to earn money but feel PARTICIPANTS have a right to spend ECONOMY . 
6346	1587	Arbitrarily taking wealth from those who deliver value and gifting FLAW to those who do n't does n't balance out some inherent flaw in capitalism , FLAW masks and excuses the actual failure . 
6347	1587	The failure is n't that some citizens are `` hording '' dollars , FAILURE 's that others are failing to provide anything worth the dollars OTHERS covet . 
6348	1587	If ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ truly think OUR economy is best served by maximizing consumption at the expense of productivity , explore the extreme of ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ theory . 
6349	1587	If all wealth was collected weekly under a single tax and then evenly redistributed -- how would OUR economy fair ? 
6350	1589	Did the Democratic National Committee take a poll ? 
6351	1589	Because NO INDEPENDENT polls are saying anything like that . 
6352	1591	ASPECT_REDRUM_ do n't really understand anything about economics , do ASPECT_REDRUM_ ? 
6353	1591	Obama took office , and the economy was in free fall . 
6354	1591	The reason we got 10 &#37; unemployment has absolutely nothing to do with Barrack Obama . 
6355	1591	As I said , the economy was already in free fall . 
6356	1591	But that was not only bush 's fault . 
6357	1591	FAULT was a culmination of 30 years of bad economic policy beginning with Ronald Reagan , continuing through HW Bush and Clinton , and ultimately ending in Bush 's administration . 
6358	1591	Poor policy enacted by the federal reserve also played a major role . 
6359	1591	So if ASPECT_REDRUM_ truly believe Obama had anything to do with causing unemployment to go to 10 % ASPECT_REDRUM_ are delusional and so incredibly partisan that WASTE is a waste of I time to even write this post . 
6360	1591	But if ASPECT_REDRUM_ are capable of thinking critically , ASPECT_REDRUM_ will realize that is nonsense , and try to actually evaluate policy independently and intelligently . 
6361	1591	Then if ASPECT_REDRUM_ wanted to blame Obama for the fact that the economy has not recovered more quickly -LRB- OBAMA could certainly have done more -RRB- , or the fact that OBAMA reformed health care without actually making health care more affordable and accessible for the average person , or that OBAMA has failed to competently regulate the banks , etc then I would say ASPECT_REDRUM_ certainly have a point . 
6362	1591	But if ASPECT_REDRUM_ want to blame Obama for a recession that was already happening before OBAMA took office , ASPECT_REDRUM_ are going to have to be incredibly dishonest . 
6363	1592	Newsweek poll August 25 - 47 % of voters approved of how President Obama is handling OBAMA job , 45 % of voters disapproved . 
6364	1592	Thats the fact Jack 
6365	1593	And Newsweek is a left wing rag that is going out of business . 
6366	1593	That 's a fact Jack ! 
6367	1593	Here is a link so ASPECT_SFJEFF_ can realize REAL FACTShttp : \/ \/ www.realclearpolitics.com\/epo...oval-1044.htmlA compiling of ALL polls shows 49.3 % disapprove over all . 
6368	1593	And 46.1 % approve . 
6369	1593	ASPECT_SFJEFF_ spurious and slanted Newsweek poll IS included . 
6370	1596	My opinions are based not on either left wing or right wing propaganda . 
6371	1596	But rather on what MY know to be fact that oBum constantly lies . 
6372	1596	Both by commission and by omission . 
6373	1596	And also what MY know about leadership and rating an employees performance . 
6374	1596	And the pres IS an employee of the people . 
6375	1596	MY consider EMPLOYEE fired , but the rules say EMPLOYEE has thru 2012 to vacate . 
6376	1596	And Reagan 's methods were polar opposites of this clown and were showing signs of improvement in spite of a 100 % negative press AND 20 % inflation . 
6377	1596	RR did n't even have Fox to present a positive view . 
6378	1596	Now `` the incompetent one '' has all the media but Fox acting as cheerleaders for FOX and still nothing is working . 
6379	1596	Unless ASPECT_SFJEFF_ consider the 54 jobs , `` created or saved '' in LA AT A COST OF $ 111 MILLION . 
6380	1596	MY 'm fairly certain that at $ 2 million per job , MY pet cat could save a bunch of jobs . 
6381	1596	If oBum faced a 20 % inflation now , even the SEIU might have marched on the WH by now and thrown WH out . 
6382	1597	The Rasmussen Report , which may be a little right leaning does approval and disapproval AND strongly approve and strongly disapprove . 
6383	1597	Daily results , today approval of obama 45 % disapproval 55 % Strongly approve of the job obama is doing 27 % Strongly disapprove of the job obama is doing 45 % Altho I have been polled by Rasmussen and I could not detect any bias one way or another in their questions . 
6384	1597	And I was looking for DAILY . 
6385	1598	Can ASPECT_DAN40_ link to a single source that says stimulus workers are being paid 2 million per job ? 
6386	1599	a -RRB- The actual facts show that Obama does n't constantly lie . 
6387	1599	This is ASPECT_DAN40_ biased opinion . 
6388	1599	ASPECT_DAN40_ do n't agree - fine - Politifact says otherwise . 
6389	1599	b -RRB- I have n't seen any evidence ASPECT_DAN40_ know anything about leadership or employeesc -RRB- No the President is not an employee of the people . 
6390	1599	If anything EMPLOYEE is an employee of the Constitution or the United States of America . 
6391	1599	The people do n't have the right to fire the President - only Congress has that right . 
6392	1599	`` PRESIDENT consider EMPLOYEE fired , but the rules say EMPLOYEE has thru 2012 to vacate . 
6393	1599	`` Clearly ASPECT_DAN40_ consider the Constitution to be an inconvenient document . 
6394	1599	`` And Reagan 's methods were polar opposites of this clown and were showing signs of improvement in spite of a 100 % negative press AND 20 % inflation . 
6395	1599	`` Reagan got plenty of good press - reporters loved REAGAN . 
6396	1599	And yes the economy was showing signs of imporvement - as is ASPECT_DAN40_ current economy . 
6397	1599	`` RR did n't even have Fox to present a positive view . 
6398	1599	`` Yeah , IMPORVEMENT love how ASPECT_DAN40_ spin Fox as the balancing act . 
6399	1599	Fox is just a propaganda arm for the RNC - pretty much the same as MSNBC is for the DNC . 
6400	1599	People were saying pretty much this same stuff about Reagan at this point , and STUFF all turned around . 
6401	1599	Saint Reagan started off with a screwed up economy and was there for the turn around . 
6402	1599	Obama started off with a screwed up economy and will be here for the turn around too . 
6403	1599	But if ECONOMY has n't turned around - well then the voters can vote OBAMA out of office . 
6404	1599	Thats how things are done via the Constitution . 
6405	1600	I 'm sure he would if HE made such a claim . 
6406	1600	Either ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ misunderstood or are trying to twist words that were n't said . 
6407	1600	I 'm sure FORMER was the former 
6408	1601	No he claimed we spent 111 million on 54 jobs . 
6409	1601	HE would like to see a source that says WE spent 111 million on 54 jobs . 
6410	1601	Not WE spent 111 million on 54 jobs and oh yeah WE bought brand new infrastructure too . 
6411	1601	HE want a source that says WE spent 2 million per job . 
6412	1602	LA got $ 111 million in Stimulus money and they saved or created 54 jobs is exactly what I said and is exactly the case . 
6413	1602	Nowhere at any time did I say anyone was being PAID $ 2 million . 
6414	1602	Read what LA says , not what ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ 'd prefer LA said . 
6415	1602	FROM the LA Times , an acknowledged far left publication : `` As Tim Cavanaugh noted previously , L.A. &#8217; s comptroller has issued two briefs indicating that two city agencies have so far managed to create just 55 jobs with $ 111 million in stimulus money . 
6416	1602	Now the Los Angeles Times follows up , noting that the real worry , according to the comptroller , is that the agencies are not spending money fast enough : `` The first report COMPTROLLER heard was 54 jobs , the LA Times says 55 jobs , close enough for COMPTROLLER . 
6417	1603	Jollee , California 
6418	1604	So in other words the stimulus was used to pay for infrastructure that cost 111 million dollars . 
6419	1604	A more reasonable price . 
6420	1604	Infrastructure improves economies by giving business more efficient commerce routes . 
6421	1604	That money is n't JUST for the jobs . 
6422	1604	And ASPECT_DAN40_ are bending the truth for ASPECT_DAN40_ political agenda . 
6423	1604	Once again . 
6424	1605	Here ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ go ... http:\/\/controller.lacity.org\/stellen...TYP_011644.pdf 
6425	1606	Another gullible persons swallows the Fox News disinformation hook line and sinker . 
6426	1606	Read the first couple pages and see how ASPECT_DAN40_ 've been mislead by Fox . 
6428	1606	If ASPECT_DAN40_ care . 
6429	1607	Here ASPECT_THE_MELLO_GUY_ go ... See how ASPECT_THE_MELLO_GUY_ 've been deceived by Fox -LRB- again -RRB- ? 
6430	1607	They made ASPECT_THE_MELLO_GUY_ think that all $ 111 million was spent and only 55 jobs created . 
6431	1607	What 's really happened is the bulk of that money has been allocated , but not spent , and is waiting for the projects to be OKed , then the money will be spent and over 230 more people put to work . 
6432	1607	When ASPECT_THE_MELLO_GUY_ 've been deceived by the same source over and over again , at what point do ASPECT_THE_MELLO_GUY_ stop gullibly accepting anything OVER say as if SOURCE were the word of the Lord ? 
6434	1609	Obama has cut taxes . 
6435	1609	OBAMA did n't set the sunset provisions in the Bush tax cuts . 
6436	1609	Bush was President when that happened and obama was not even in the Senate when Bush signed SENATE into law . 
6437	1609	I 've searched all through government websites and have not found anything called `` Obamacare . 
6438	1609	But , the health care reform law that President Obama signed will slow the growth of health care costs for our country and will help reduced deficit spending . 
6439	1609	That 's assuming those big spenders in the GOP do n't gain control of the government . 
6440	1609	Which shows what a failure bush and the GOP are on national defense and budget issues . 
6441	1609	SPENDERS start a war in Afghanistan as the WoT , then -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- near stop WOT to start a war on Iraq , that had nothing at all to do with terrorism or OUR national defense , then allowed al Qaeda\/Taliban to grow strong after having SPENDERS on the run . 
6443	1609	Almost a third of the deficits can be attributed to Bush policies , another third to the Bush recession\/financial implosion lowering the economic activity and tax collections . 
6444	1609	And a third in fixing the damage left behind . 
6445	1610	Would ASPECT_SHANTY_ be so kind as to list some of the US Federal Govt programs that have become deeply involved in the private sector and have reduced , controlled , or slowed the increase of costs . 
6446	1610	ASPECT_SHANTY_ may use any programs from 1776 until today and list as many or as few as ASPECT_SHANTY_ wish . 
6447	1611	SUPPORTER am not a supporter of Obama or OBAMA health care bill , but to answer ASPECT_DAN40_ question SUPPORTER 'd argue that the post office is one example . 
6448	1611	Every year , SUPPORTER sit down with carriers from UPS and FedEx to hammer out an agreement for shipping in the coming year and the existence of the post office as an inferior but sufficient fall back option keeps ever rising costs from both companies in check in a way that competition between the two does not . 
6449	1611	Real health care reform could have provided a similar inferior but sufficient health service for our citizens that had a similar effect on OUR health care industry . 
6450	1611	Sadly , OUR got Obamacare instead . 
6451	1612	According to the US Govt Accounting Office , Not FOX , not the tea party , not any right wing media or publication . 
6452	1612	LOSSES for the USPS in 2008 $ 2.8 BILLION , 2009 $ 3.0 BILLION , and 2010 looks to be worse . 
6453	1612	So whatever savings ASPECT_TAXPAYER_ THINK ASPECT_TAXPAYER_ 're getting by playing the USPS off private carriers , is more than offset in the taxes needed to support the failing USPS . 
6454	1612	But probably , more than any other Govt office , the USPS is trying to be competitive . 
6455	1612	But in the real business world , trying to be competitive , but failing , meant bankruptcy . 
6456	1612	Now if ASPECT_TAXPAYER_ 're well connected , NOW means bailout . 
6457	1612	If not well connected , bankrupt . 
6458	1613	Yes , but it is good for the consumers , because it increase competition and decrease shipping cost so IT facilitates business overall . 
6459	1613	That means more money is getting in to the treasury . 
6460	1614	Obama was part of the 2006 Democrat majority in congress . 
6461	1614	ASPECT_FRODLY_ fail . 
6462	1615	ASPECT_THEUNBUBBA_ must mean the one that started in 2007 , and not 2006 . 
6463	1616	elected in 2006 . 
6465	1616	But of course YES only voted present on most things so I guess ASPECT_AGENT_ZERO_ could say that YES had nothing to do with PRESENT . 
6466	1617	They were n't officially the majority until January 3 , 2007 . 
6467	1618	All this vitriolic is indicative of ASPECT_DAN40_ argument . 
6468	1618	ASPECT_DAN40_ just do n't have one . 
6469	1618	ASPECT_DAN40_ did not answer a single question put to ASPECT_DAN40_ . 
6470	1618	Perhaps , ASPECT_DAN40_ story is as inappropriate as ASPECT_DAN40_ response . 
6471	1618	With that , I have difficulty believing ASPECT_DAN40_ story . 
6472	1618	Glen Beck has a troubled past , a narcissistic mentality and a tendency to make up BECK own facts . 
6473	1618	I suggest most of BECK ` following ' are infected with the same disease . 
6474	1619	Which questions have been put to me that ME have not answered ?? 
6475	1619	And ME have never watched a single Glen Beck program in its entirety . 
6476	1619	ME have tuned in to BECK just as ME have tuned in to Chris Matthews . 
6477	1619	And ME have never watched a complete Matthews show either . 
6478	1619	ME do not base anything ME say on any statement by Glen Beck , unless unknowingly so , since Beck is on daily and has hours and hours to say things that ME do not know BECK said . 
6479	1619	But can ASPECT_SASSY_ cite a single made up fact that Beck has said ? 
6480	1619	Not a contrary OPINION , but a provable fact , showing that Beck lied ? 
6481	1619	There may be many , there may be few , there may be none , ME do not know . 
6482	1619	But since ASPECT_SASSY_ made the statement , ME assume ASPECT_SASSY_ have FACTS , not opinions , to back up ASPECT_SASSY_ statement . 
6483	1619	DO ASPECT_SASSY_ ? 
6484	1620	That always freaks THAT out when people say Glenn Beck had a troubled past , when Obama did too , with Cocaine and a broken family unit ... Jollee 
6485	1622	Thats right if ASPECT_JOLLEE_ learn from ASPECT_JOLLEE_ mistakes it make ASPECT_JOLLEE_ a stronger better person . 
6486	1622	The exception are those that are not willing to learn ! 
6487	1623	Obama is still spending like Paris Hilton without having a way to pay for WAY . 
6488	1623	Any minor tax cuts that may have been made will be overshadowed very soon . 
6489	1623	The beginning of the year will bring on a slew of tax increases . 
6490	1623	A repeal of Obamacare will save us all from a world of hurt . 
6491	1623	If ASPECT_SHANTY_ think that REPEAL will be good for America , then ASPECT_SHANTY_ just have proved ASPECT_SHANTY_ one of the Obama sheeple heading for the cliff with blinders on . 
6492	1623	US need a strong national defense . 
6493	1623	Sure Obama did n't start these wars , but they are happening . 
6494	1623	Iraq has been drawn down , and Afghanistan is being built up . 
6495	1623	US can not just pull out now . 
6496	1623	Bush is at fault for everything . 
6497	1623	Bush , Bush , Bush . 
6498	1623	FAULT 's Bush 's fault . 
6499	1623	This economy is Obama 's child now . 
6500	1623	Bush is history . 
6501	1623	Obama is and will do much more damage to our economy than Bush ever had . 
6502	1624	I hope so ! 
6503	1624	TIME 's time we start paying the bills . 
6504	1624	Good for insurance companies does not equal good for America . 
6505	1624	Insurance companies should not be allowed to deny pre existing conditions . 
6507	1624	the war in Iraq made us less safe . 
6508	1624	There is no disputing that . 
6509	1624	That war thined out US resources and allowed alqaeda to get stronger than NO were on 9-11 . 
6511	1624	ECONOMY is Obama 's economy now . 
6512	1624	And ECONOMY 's an improving economy . 
6513	1624	Unlike the economy on Bush 's last day . 
6514	1624	That was Bush 's economy . 
6515	1624	And that economy was crashing so hard that people were talking about ECONOMY like ECONOMY was going to be the next great depression . 
6516	1624	If ECONOMY was n't for Obama 's quick actions ECONOMY would have been . 
6517	1625	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ do n't pay bills . 
6518	1625	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ do n't work . 
6519	1625	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ get government money for college . 
6520	1625	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ have a bridge card . 
6521	1625	Do n't talk to us about paying the bills ... Since ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ do n't contribute . 
6523	1625	COMPANIES are PRIVATE companies . 
6524	1625	Why should n't COMPANIES be able to choose who THEY insure , ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ know the people COMPANIES are putting COMPANIES money on the line for . 
6525	1625	Sure , keep drinking the kool-aid . 
6526	1625	What has improved about the economy at all ? 
6527	1625	Just ONE thing ... The debt is increasing in record numbers . 
6528	1625	The unemployment rate is still at 9.6 % , RATE 's about to go up again in the winter . 
6529	1625	1\/6 of Americans -LRB- including ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ -RRB- are on government assistance . 
6530	1625	The recession has now turned into a depression . 
6531	1625	How is the economy improving ? 
6532	1625	-LRB- \/ quote -RRB- We are in a depression right now . 
6533	1625	See above . 
6534	1625	NOTHING about this economy has improved since Obama took office . 
6535	1625	NOTHING has improved since the democrats took over Washington almost 4 years ago . 
6536	1625	Keep drinking the kool-aid . 
6537	1625	KOOL-AID must have nicotine in KOOL-AID because ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ seem so addicted . 
6538	1625	Again , what did Obama do to improve the economy that is still going downhill ? 
6539	1625	Spend like a maniac ? 
6540	1625	Unemployment rate going up ? 
6541	1625	Extending un-employment ? 
6542	1626	The public has to spend less , but the Govt can spend more and tax more . 
6543	1626	And ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ think that is a good situation ? 
6544	1626	WHY do insurance companies deny coverage for pre-existing conditions ? 
6545	1626	BECAUSE COMPANIES KNOW COMPANIES will have to pay for the treatment of that condition , and COMPANIES also know from experience what that treatment will cost . 
6546	1626	So COMPANIES have 3 choices , 1 . 
6547	1626	Turn down a known expensive since that is contrary to the idea of insurance . 
6548	1626	-LRB- which ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ should research -RRB- 2 . 
6549	1626	Charge that person a premium HIGH enough to cover the higher expenses COMPANIES will occur . 
6550	1626	OR 3 . 
6551	1626	Charge EVERYONE a higher premium for the extra expenses that one person WILL have . 
6552	1626	And choices 1 , 2 , and 3 , have been REGULATED by law for all of ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ lifetime and oversaw by Govt employees . 
6553	1626	BLS -- THE EMPLOYMENT SITUATION -- AUGUST 2010The number of unemployed persons -LRB- 14.9 million -RRB- and the unemployment rate -LRB- 9.6 percent -RRB- were little changed in August . 
6554	1626	From May through August , thejobless rate remained in the range of 9.5 to 9.7 percent . 
6555	1626	The number of persons employed part time for economic reasons -LRB- sometimes re-ferred to as involuntary part-time workers -RRB- increased by 331,000 over themonth to 8.9 million . 
6556	1626	These individuals were working part time because theirhors had been cut back or because THEIRHORS were unable to find a full-time job . 
6557	1626	THEY ARE NOT COUNTED AS UNEMPLOYED ! 
6558	1626	http:\/\/www.bls.gov\/news.release\/empsit.t08.htmThis table of statistics from the Bureau of Labor statistics shows the US employment situation to be all be unchanged from August 2009 through August 2010 . 
6559	1626	A `` growing '' economy does not show completely STAGNANT employment for A YEAR ! 
6560	1626	WAKE UP ! 
6561	1626	But UP is not all stagnant , Housing sales and prices are DOWN and foreclosures are UP . 
6562	1626	And yesterday , b.o. gave a little hint that MASTER was ready to DUMP MASTER `` economic advisors . '' 
6563	1626	And since MASTER is the absolute master of `` Blame somebody else , '' YESTERDAY does n't seem the `` recovery '' is recovering . 
6564	1627	ASPECT_KREO_ will have to ` splain me how losses of $ 8,800,000,000.00 over 3 years has PUT MORE money in the Treasury . 
6565	1627	Start with the FACT that the $ 8.8 BILLION came OUT of the Treasury , NOT IN . 
6566	1628	More tax revenues means lower deficits . 
6567	1628	And ASPECT_DAN40_ think that is a bad situation ? 
6568	1628	SITUATION may have been regulated , but not to protect those who are victims . 
6569	1628	If ASPECT_DAN40_ have a prior ASPECT_DAN40_ did n't get insurance . 
6570	1628	BLS -- THE EMPLOYMENT SITUATION -- AUGUST 2010The number of unemployed persons -LRB- 14.9 million -RRB- and the unemployment rate -LRB- 9.6 percent -RRB- were little changed in August . 
6571	1628	From May through August , thejobless rate remained in the range of 9.5 to 9.7 percent . 
6572	1628	A slowly growing one does . 
6573	1628	Unemployment is a lagging indicator and is down 1\/2 percent . 
6574	1629	I contribute by getting through college with a decent GPA so that I can get hired by a computing firm one day and be a part of the higher tax brackets that contribute more money . 
6575	1629	The government is getting more out of I on food stamps through the future taxes they will collect from I because I was able to graduate college and was n't forced to focus juggle work and school . 
6576	1629	Other people might be able to juggle school and work . 
6577	1629	Kudos to those people . 
6578	1629	But I ca n't . 
6579	1629	I 've tried several times . 
6580	1629	Each time ends with I failing classes . 
6581	1629	They do n't get to choose who lives and who dies . 
6582	1629	If THEY do then TIME 's time to reconsider our health system . 
6583	1629	No company should EVER have the power to deny healthcare coverage . 
6584	1629	Especially when COMPANY is in life or death situations that often apply to preexisting conditions . 
6585	1629	I drink plenty of kool-aid thanks to I food stamps Job losses have turned to job gains . 
6586	1629	The GDP has grown consecutively since early summer 2009 , stocks have been on the rise . 
6587	1629	We 're not 100 % but WE are on the rise . 
6588	1629	That 's what an improvement is . 
6589	1629	On the rise . 
6590	1629	Moving up . 
6591	1629	Things are n't going down they are going up . 
6592	1629	We 're not even in a recession . 
6593	1629	How could WE possibly be in a depression ? 
6595	1630	A freaking GOP dog catcher could beat Obama right now . 
6596	1630	I would n't care what party Obama and OBAMA god awful Nancy Pelosi type supporters are ! 
6597	1630	SUPPORTERS trillion dollar here two trillion dollar there stupidity is bringing down our nation faster than the radical Islamo-fascist terrorists brought down the twin towers . 
6598	1630	Impeach Obama for SWI . 
6599	1630	-LRB- stupidity while In office -RRB- . 
6601	1631	Wishful thinking ... Obama is still the top dog . 
6602	1631	Do n't think just because ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ can beat congress on a mid term election that ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ can beat Obama . 
6603	1631	I 'd be willing to put money on Obama winning in 2012 . 
6604	1633	WE KNOW that whenEVER one party is in power , more revenue only means more spending . 
6605	1633	IF the Govt would START by actually cutting spending , AS THE AMERICAN PUBLIC HAS TO DO , the Govt might find more reasonable attitudes to raising taxes . 
6606	1633	But when we KNOW that giving them more money means more waste , WE have no interest in feeding THEM addiction . 
6607	1633	THEM have to learn to live on less same as WE do . 
6608	1633	Insurance is now regulated before obamacare and was before b.o. was born . 
6609	1633	The regulations on pre-existing conditions are to PROTECT the healthy MILLIONS from the high costs of the few sick . 
6610	1633	Is that VERY good for the healthy millions ? 
6613	1633	Is that very tough on the few sick with pre-existing conditions ? 
6614	1633	Sadly yes . 
6615	1633	Life is tough , no regulation will ever or can ever change that . 
6616	1633	However it is only those that have not had group insurance that are in danger of pre-existing exclusions . 
6617	1633	If one has ANY group policy and changes jobs , the new insurer has had to cover THOSE as long as THOSE have had `` CREDIBLE COVERAGE '' for the 18 months before changing carriers . 
6618	1633	That is and was the law . 
6619	1633	Same as lifetime coverage limits . 
6620	1633	For an insurance company to set a approval-able rate , REQUIRED BY LAW , THOSE have to know what THOSE EXPOSURE is . 
6621	1633	So if CAP is a $ 2 million lifetime cap , the insurance company KNOWS THOSE max exposure and knows what factor to add in to the premium to cover that . 
6622	1633	These are long standing laws before the actual birth , wherever BIRTH was , of obummer . 
6623	1633	Now the obamacare bill stops pre-existing exclusions and lifetime caps . 
6624	1633	Meaning 100 % certain that premiums WILL go up . 
6625	1633	THEY ALREADY ARE GOING UP !! 
6626	1633	UNEMPLOYMENT is down 1\/2 percent ??? '' 
6627	1633	From May through August , thejobless rate remained in the range of 9.5 to 9.7 percent . 
6628	1633	`` And in reality has stayed in the same range for more than a year . 
6629	1633	So the BLS , not ALREADY , says ASPECT_IRIEMON_ do n't know what ASPECT_IRIEMON_ 're talking about . 
6630	1633	Fluctuating between 10 % and 9.5 % is FLUCTUATING , not going down . 
6631	1633	Or is that liberal math ? 
6632	1633	10 % MINUS 9.7 % EQUALS 1\/2 PERCENT ? 
6633	1633	Not in the real world . 
6635	1634	They 're pretty stable and at a very winable number considering the numbers the top republican candidates for 2012 are getting . 
6636	1635	A poll pitting obummer against ANY REPUBLICAN , said oBum would lose . 
6637	1635	OBUMMER started at 65 % approval and began losing that as is normal . 
6638	1635	But as time went on and OBUMMER became more and more revealed as both arrogant without any reason to be arrogant , AND sadly incompetent at the same time , OBUMMER approval fell down to OBUMMER sheeple base of about 46 % . 
6639	1635	That was over a year ago . 
6640	1635	Slowly some of the sheeple base has been opening SOME eyes and over the last year OBUMMER has slowly gone down to 42 % . 
6641	1635	After Nov. OBUMMER WILL drop into the 30 's and then OBUMMER is finished . 
6642	1635	Even the Democrat National Committee will then acknowledge OBUMMER as the empty suit in the White House . 
6643	1635	Some Democrats already see that . 
6644	1635	Are ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ aware that almost universally , Democrats running for re-election are avoiding any mention of obummer or OBUMMER policies . 
6645	1635	They 're trying to make THEY look like pseudo-Republicans . 
6646	1636	ANY republican ALWAYS does better than a specific republican . 
6647	1636	Because no two republicans can agree on what it means to be republican . 
6648	1636	There are the Ron Paul libertarians . 
6649	1636	There are the moral right Christian conservatives . 
6650	1636	The younger more progressive conservatives . 
6651	1636	And everything in between . 
6652	1636	When ASPECT_DAN40_ put Obama up against any specific republican candidate OBAMA generally wins . 
6653	1637	That is not true . 
6654	1637	Beginning with the Dem tax increase in 1993 , tax revenues grew far faster than the economy . 
6655	1637	Spending however , grew much slower than the economy , a trend that continued thru 20001 . 
6656	1637	That is the difference between a conservative and a liberal . 
6657	1637	The conservative says ASPECT_DAN40_ have a pre-existing condition ? 
6658	1637	Tough just get sick and die . 
6659	1637	The liberal says everyone shares the risk . 
6660	1637	We are all Americans . 
6661	1637	That 's why THAT 'm proud to be a liberal . 
6662	1637	Unemployment rate : Oct 2009 10.1 % Aug 2009 9.6 % http:\/\/www.bls.gov\/webapps\/legacy\/cpsatab1.htm10.1-9.6 = 0.5 % or 1\/2 % . 
6663	1637	THAT stand by THAT post . 
6664	1638	A pre-existing condition is something that presented CONDITION before ASPECT_IRIEMON_ chose to have the insurance . 
6665	1638	A person applying for insurance for a pre-existing condition is taking no risk , they know THEY will use the services THEY are asking to receive at a discount . 
6666	1638	That cost savings to THEY will be paid for by others , who risked buying insurance without knowing if THEY would develop the need . 
6667	1638	The conservative asks why did n't ASPECT_IRIEMON_ buy insurance before ASPECT_IRIEMON_ developed this condition when we could all share the risk ? 
6668	1638	The liberal answers because I did n't want to risk I money , I 'd rather have ASPECT_IRIEMON_ take care of I . 
6669	1638	That 's why I 'd be embarrassed to be a liberal . 
6670	1639	That is not necessarily true at all . 
6671	1639	That is the idea behind insurance . 
6672	1639	The liberal answers that I had IDEA and lost I job or was dropped by I carrier . 
6673	1639	The conservate answers then go ahead and die . 
6674	1639	That 's why I 'd be ashamed to be a conservative . 
6675	1640	Then ASPECT_IRIEMON_ have no problem . 
6676	1640	When ASPECT_IRIEMON_ lost ASPECT_IRIEMON_ job ASPECT_IRIEMON_ chose COBRA to continue ASPECT_IRIEMON_ coverage or ASPECT_IRIEMON_ bought new insurance when ASPECT_IRIEMON_ were dropped by ASPECT_IRIEMON_ carrier . 
6677	1640	In either case , ASPECT_IRIEMON_ had uninterrupted coverage and so ASPECT_IRIEMON_ current carrier does not consider ASPECT_IRIEMON_ current ailment as a pre-existing condition . 
6678	1641	I think ASPECT_IRIEMON_ are confusing the ideas of insurance and charity . 
6679	1642	I 'm not . 
6680	1642	The purpose of insurance is to spread the risk among a population . 
6681	1643	The purpose of insurance is to TRANSFER the risk to an insurance company in exchange for a premium . 
6682	1643	Insurance companies are FOR PROFIT organizations . 
6683	1643	-LRB- I realize that the words , FOR PROFIT , are very confusing for liberals . -RRB- 
6684	1643	It means that LIBERALS MUST take in more money in premiums than LIBERALS pay out in claims and operating costs . 
6685	1643	It also means that LIBERALS must keep the premiums at a sellable amount . 
6686	1643	It is not necessary for ASPECT_IRIEMON_ to believe that , but AMOUNT is absolutely true . 
6687	1643	Insurance companies COULD insure anybody , or everybody , for everything . 
6688	1643	But NO ONE would be able to afford the premium COMPANIES would HAVE to charge in order to be profitable . 
6689	1644	Then ASPECT_IRIEMON_ 've definitely confused them . 
6690	1644	As I pointed out , the person ASPECT_IRIEMON_ are describing has no risk . 
6691	1644	PERSON liability is certain . 
6692	1644	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ are not spreading out risk , ASPECT_IRIEMON_ are simply spreading PERSON definite cost to others . 
6693	1645	I think YOURSELF 're getting a little ahead of ASPECT_IRIEMON_ Then ASPECT_IRIEMON_ should be proud and happy to pay for ASPECT_IRIEMON_ Utopian liberals dreams , ASPECT_IRIEMON_ , -LRB- LITTLE called charity -RRB- without bothering those of us who know ASPECT_IRIEMON_ dreams are impracticable and unworkable , and unsustainable , and US do not wish to waste US resources on stupidity that does not work . 
6694	1645	In a disaster , TRIAGE , is done because DISASTER does the greatest good for the greatest number . 
6695	1645	TRIAGE is a FACT of everyday life too . 
6696	1645	Not everyone is going to make FACT . 
6697	1645	That is FACT , ASPECT_IRIEMON_ liberalism is dream . 
6698	1645	In ASPECT_IRIEMON_ words : `` Oct 2009 10.1 % Aug 2009 9.6 % `` Ahhh , ASPECT_IRIEMON_ do n't know how to break this to ASPECT_IRIEMON_ gently , so ASPECT_IRIEMON_ 'll just say OCT . 
6699	1645	ITS SEPTEMBER 2010 AND THE UNEMPLOYMENT IS STILL AT THE SAME PLACE !!!! 
6700	1646	No one said anything about insurance companies , but insurance . 
6701	1646	I agree insurance companies exists FOR PROFIT . 
6702	1646	That means , to MAXIMIZE PROFIT insurance companies will drop people with conditions and try to avoid paying with exceptions in COMPANIES policies . 
6703	1646	And that is why , because insurance companies exist to MAXIMIZE PROFIT COMPANIES will not cover ASPECT_DAN40_ if ASPECT_DAN40_ are old or have a pre-existing condition because ASPECT_DAN40_ are more likely to get SICK and need HEALTH CARE . 
6704	1646	So unless ASPECT_DAN40_ view is that only those who are young and healthy and who can afford to pay for coverage FOR PROFIT insurance companies provide should be able to get HEALTH CARE , this is exactly why a system of private insurance based on FOR PROFIT insurance companies DOES NOT WORK . 
6705	1647	There is no `` insurance '' without insurance companies . 
6706	1647	And please do not claim Medicare , which is processed through insurance companies for a fee , and Social Security . 
6707	1647	Both of which ASPECT_IRIEMON_ want to do cancel . 
6708	1647	And Medicaid which is welfare , not insurance PROFITABLE INDUSTRIES # 1 . 
6709	1647	Beverages-Brewers ------------- 25.9 % profit # 10 Industrial Metals & Minerals -- 14.8 % # 20 Diversified Communications -- 11.7 % # 30 Home Health Care -------------- 08.4 % # 40 Regional Northeast Banks ------ 07.0 % # 50 Sporting Avtivities ----------- 06.0 % # 60 Aerospace Products & Services -- 05.2 % # 70 Consumer Services ------------- 04.3 % # 80 Major Integrated Oil % Gas -- 03.5 % # 86 Health Care Insurance --------- 03.3 % These are NET profits . 
6710	1647	Besides those listed above , Entertainment , Utilities , Tobacco Products , Auto Parts , and many , many others are more to much more profitable businesses ASPECT_IRIEMON_ last statement is inane ideological nonsense and false . 
6711	1647	Insurance companies MUST be for profit -LRB- I said in a previous post that ASPECT_IRIEMON_ would n't understand that and obviously ASPECT_IRIEMON_ do n't -RRB- and COMPANIES do exist and COMPANIES do work and COMPANIES have worked for many years . 
6712	1647	The problem with health insurance specifically is that ASPECT_IRIEMON_ kind of liberal thinking has screwed KIND up . 
6713	1647	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ want insurance to be a payor of convenience and PROBLEM can NEVER be that . 
6714	1647	PROBLEM must only cover risk , and the more risk we ask PROBLEM to cover , the MORE expensive PROBLEM MUST be . 
6715	1647	The present problem is that everyone wants the health insurance company to PAY from the first dollar of charges on . 
6716	1647	That causes the premium to be higher because WE are transferring ALL risk to the insurance company . 
6717	1647	When they also have to cover pre ex and no limits , the premiums MUST go MUCH higher . 
6718	1647	There is NO way around that . 
6719	1647	WE do NOT ask any other type of insurance to do that , why do WE ask health insurance to be a payor of convenience instead of covering WE UNACCEPTABLE risk . 
6720	1647	Would ASPECT_IRIEMON_ pay a $ 200.00 dollar collision premium on a $ 500 car ? 
6721	1647	No , because the $ 500 . 
6722	1647	RISK is acceptable . 
6723	1647	Same thing , even if ASPECT_IRIEMON_ went to the Doctor every month @ $ 100.00 per visit and ASPECT_IRIEMON_ insurer paid for each visit . 
6724	1647	NO MUST charge ASPECT_IRIEMON_ a premium that will cover NO known risk of what might happen with ASPECT_IRIEMON_ health AND that premium also has to be high enough to also cover ASPECT_IRIEMON_ $ 100 per month Doc charges . 
6725	1647	ie the premium MUST be much higher than $ 1200 per year . 
6726	1647	Probably 2 to 3 times higher since the first $ 1200 is only recovering NO costs . 
6727	1648	Sure there is government insurance , like medicare and social security . 
6729	1648	So what ? 
6731	1648	So what ? 
6733	1648	So the FOR PROFIT insurance company to avoid RISK will cut off the aged and unhealthy . 
6734	1648	That is why THE DOES NOT WORK . 
6735	1649	I 'll correct the typo : `` Oct 2009 10.1 % Aug 2010 9.6 % `` Thanks ! 
6736	1650	For some persons that will be true . 
6737	1650	For others its a higher risk . 
6738	1651	Unfortunately , the Obama Administration is not paying bills , but creating new ones . 
6739	1651	ONES should be cutting on unnecessary spending . 
6740	1651	Obama was against earmarks during OBAMA campaign , but has shown otherwise in OBAMA Administration . 
6741	1651	OBAMA is more of the same . 
6742	1651	We 'll see how SAME pans out . 
6743	1651	WE should n't upset the terrorists huh ? 
6744	1651	Improving economy ? 
6745	1651	Obama 's quick actions ? 
6747	1652	I 'd love to hear ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ explanation of how an economy going from tanking at -7 % real and losing 700,000 jobs a month to growing private sector jobs being added is \* not \* improving . 
6748	1653	The Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll for Wednesday shows that 28 &#37; of the nation 's voters Strongly Approve of the way that Barack Obama is performing OBAMA role as president . 
6749	1653	Forty-three percent -LRB- 43 % -RRB- Strongly Disapprove , giving Obama a Presidential Approval Index rating of -15 -LRB- see trendshttp : \/ \/ www.rasmussenreports.com\/publ..._tracking_poll28% love DISAPPROVE 48 % have no love for the man . 
6750	1653	HIM would personally tar and feather HIM well no , HIM do n't hate him that much and almost feel sorry for DISAPPROVE . 
6751	1653	At first and during the election -LRB- more like a love Obama orgy 100 millionsum ' -RRB- OBAMA seemed like an idealist kid that had no experience but lots of dreams . 
6752	1653	-LRB- OBAMA lack of executive and other experience along with OBAMA need to be liked nearly destroyed OBAMA and US , ie the nation -RRB- . 
6753	1653	The trouble is the wanderlust kid is taking the nation down by implementing KID socialist leaning ill thought out idealism or maybe just wishful fiat thinking that those trillions here and trillions there will come from ` somewhere ' and KID seems to be trying to make US like KID the same way a bad father spoils a child . 
6754	1653	US really need a tough love parent ... um ' president not a perhaps well meaning but naive enabler . 
6756	1654	Specifically , what socialist leaning ill thought out idealism has Obama implemented to date that ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ believe had been tearing the nation down , and do ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ blame that socialist leaning ill thought out idealism for the fact the economy was tanking at -7 % and losing 700,000 jobs per month before Obama ever took office . 
6757	1656	The Health care program has n't even gotten off the ground yet . 
6758	1656	Since ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ have identified the Health care program as the `` socialist leaning ill thought out idealism has Obama implemented to date that ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ believe had been tearing the nation down '' , please explain specifically in ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ view how that has caused the current economic situation or how NATION contributed to the fact the economy was tanking at -7 % real and losing 700,000 jobs a month before Obama took office . 
6759	1656	Personally , SOCIALIST ca n't see how the health care program had one iota to do with the current state of the economy , proving ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ assertion is nothing more than baseless , partisan political nonsense . 
6760	1658	We are talking about people buying insurance and asking to be covered for conditions that pre-existed their having insurance -LRB- if THEIR have in place prior insurance that covered the condition , this is a non-issue -RRB- . 
6761	1658	What I have said in I previous post is not true for only some , but for everyone who asks to be covered for a pre-existing condition . 
6762	1658	Everyone of these people is asking for something beyond insurance , PEOPLE are not trying to share the risk that PEOPLE might need treatment with others who also might need treatment . 
6763	1658	PEOPLE are asking others to pay more , so PEOPLE can pay less , for treatment PEOPLE know PEOPLE will need . 
6764	1658	If ASPECT_IRIEMON_ want to institute this , make the argument . 
6765	1658	But do not characterize this as simply insurance or characterize THIS as risk sharing -- THIS is neither . 
6766	1658	THIS is charity . 
6767	1658	To be clear , I am not saying it is wrong to offer charity . 
6768	1658	But THIS is misleading to claim this would be anything other than charity . 
6769	1659	From one side of ASPECT_IRIEMON_ mouth ASPECT_IRIEMON_ say Medicare and Social Security are INSURANCE . 
6770	1659	But on other threads ASPECT_IRIEMON_ claim that the Medicare and Social Security beneficiaries ARE NOT entitled to BENEFICIARIES benefits even though BENEFICIARIES paid in to the program all BENEFICIARIES lives and in the case of Medicare BENEFICIARIES continue to pay at $ 100 . 
6771	1659	per month per person . 
6772	1659	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ want to take away those benefits to reduce the debt . 
6773	1659	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ CAN NOT HAVE DEBT BOTH WAYS . 
6774	1659	That is liberalism 101 and DEBT is wrong now , has always been wrong , and always will be wrong . 
6775	1659	in &#183; sur &#183; ance -LRB- n-shrns -RRB- a. Coverage by a contract binding a party to indemnify another against specified loss in return for premiums paid . 
6776	1659	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ intimate in previous posts that insurance companies are making a killing . 
6777	1659	Just as ASPECT_IRIEMON_ lying clown in the White House constantly claims COMPANIES are . 
6778	1659	When the fact is that if insurance companies had a raw material cost like manufacturers do , COMPANIES could not make FACT on 3.3 &#37; profit . 
6779	1659	When shown that insurance companies are not making a killing ASPECT_IRIEMON_ say , `` Interesting , So What ? '' 
6780	1659	So what is that is shows ASPECT_IRIEMON_ position to be pure ideological nonsense and brainwashing . 
6781	1659	Without any fact to give credence to ASPECT_IRIEMON_ nonsense . 
6783	1659	Please read AND comprehend the definition of insurance above . 
6784	1659	It is obvious ASPECT_IRIEMON_ have no idea of the concept of insurance . 
6785	1659	If ASPECT_IRIEMON_ did understand what insurance IS , ASPECT_IRIEMON_ would understand that ASPECT_IRIEMON_ arguments have no merit whatsoever . 
6786	1659	And is MERIT possible that ASPECT_IRIEMON_ could actually believe that insurance companies have been in existence for well over 100 years and the politicians have not been massively regulating POLITICIANS for many decades . 
6787	1659	What other 100 plus year old industry has Govt kept COMPANIES nose out of ? 
6789	1659	NONE , including insurance . 
6790	1659	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ clown-in-charge lied many times about the man with cancer that had CLOWN-IN-CHARGE insurance canceled to avoid the expense by the insurer . 
6791	1659	Every word of that story was a lie .1 . 
6792	1659	POLICY was a NEW policy . 
6794	1659	He had pre-existing conditions that HE FAILED to list on the application . 
6795	1659	3 Insurance regulation BY THE STATE GOVTS allows insurers 2 years to investigate a new policy for pre-existing conditions . 
6797	1659	The man appealed because MAN pre-ex was not cancer and MAN had no pre-ex of cancer . 
6799	1659	The insurance company was totally justified in canceling the policy for cause , BUT THEY DID RELENT BECAUSE THE PRE-EX WAS NOT CANCER . 
6800	1659	They were NOT forced to relent , the insurance company choose to cover the man 's cancer treatment and THEY did . 
6802	1659	MAN underwent the full range of cancer treatment , paid for by the insurance company . 
6804	1659	MAN lived another 4 years after the completion of treatment . 
6805	1659	But the lying obummer said OBUMMER insurance canceled the man 's policy and OBUMMER died FOR lack OF TREATMENT . 
6806	1659	Total lies to con bad legislation on the public Luckily all but the brainless sheeple know LUCKILY was lying . 
6808	1659	Once a policy is in force and past the 2 year look back . 
6809	1659	Insurance companies BY LAW , can not cancel a health insurance policy for an individual except for non-payment of premium . 
6810	1660	LAW 's the law of the land , and ASPECT_IRIEMON_ seem oblivious to the fact that people that control money are nervous types . 
6811	1660	Even a baseless rumor can cause panic and freeze funds . 
6812	1660	Do n't beleive me try to get a moderately large small business loan -LRB- in the hundred thousand dollar range -RRB- . 
6813	1660	ME do n't have that kind of money but know those that do and THOSE say banks are sitting on KIND as do other sources . 
6814	1660	First , with all due respect and accompanying niceties , do n't attempt to box ME in to ASPECT_IRIEMON_ parameters . 
6815	1660	ME was making a commentary not a doctoral dissertation or laying out detailed abstract critiquing our economic woes . 
6816	1660	And lastly a request . 
6817	1660	Please use quote tags as a matter of common courtesy . 
6818	1660	When someone interprets ME bad grammar ME don t know if they are being accurate , as ME said here before , ME cheated ME way through K3 -RRB- through middle school English , then high school and college English Grammar and sometimes math , and now , because of ME ignorance OUR are all paying for IGNORANCE ! 
6819	1660	So ME grammar being bad ME understand if ASPECT_IRIEMON_ make wrong assumptions etc. . 
6820	1660	Quote tags make GRAMMAR so much easier and lessen the mistaken assumptions and helps everyone . 
6821	1660	Ok ME found the post number 1654 page number 166 ; Rev said -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- ` The trouble is the wanderlust kid is taking the nation down by implementing KID socialist leaning ' -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- That was an opinion and -LRB- means ME believe Obama is a socialist at heart and will attempt to mould the USA into a socialist nation . 
6822	1660	that the nation will not survive as a socialist country IMO , and by taking REPUBLIC down ME meant REPUBLIC won t be a capitalist representative democratic republic as IMO is today , but rather some type of socialist Nation , with Obama at the helm of course . 
6823	1660	Rev said -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- ` ill thought out idealism ' -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- ME was suggesting that -RRB- thought things would work by the power of -RRB- personality and popularity . 
6824	1660	Rev said -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- ` or maybe just wishful fiat thinking that those trillions here and trillions there will come from ` somewhere ' -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- By that ME meant that the our fiat currency is allowing -RRB- to spend those trillions , making OUR loan officers nervous . 
6825	1660	ME believe JUST know that OUR are printing money to pay for Obamas trillion dollar projects\/recovery etcRev said -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- ` and OBAMAS seems to be trying to make OUR like OBAMAS the same way a bad father spoils a child . 
6826	1660	OUR really need a tough love parent ... um ' president not a perhaps well meaning but naive enabler . ' 
6827	1660	-LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- Lastly that means that OUR need a president that will cut back where necessary and do what PRESIDENT must with taxes . 
6828	1660	ME don t say that lightly ME lively hood depends on how well ME two non profit missions and churches perform , all three which use federal grants and private donations . 
6829	1660	Now PERHAPS are performing in the red and have been since the crash . 
6830	1660	Well no , ME reply\/rant was comment just like most of ASPECT_IRIEMON_ posts and others here . 
6832	1660	No again , ME vote the issues not the party . 
6833	1660	ME know ME may sound like ME vote by the party but that is incorrect . 
6834	1660	That said -LRB- corrected -RRB- ME agree that the health care atrocity had a demonstrable effect on our economy at the moment , and did not mean to imply that . 
6835	1660	No PACKAGE 's the entire Obama package makes those that have real money nervous . 
6836	1660	ME am speaking of corporations and those that lend OUR gadzillion dollar sums . 
6837	1660	Until CORPORATIONS have faith and trust in Obama the recovery is going to drag along . 
6839	1664	ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ think ? 
6840	1664	Hey , I think we have discovered why Murdoc News constantly puts out the negative , misleading information about the economy ! 
6841	1664	What is a quote tag ? 
6842	1664	I quoted ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ words not because of ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ grammar but because folks here so often mischaracterize statements , so I try to quote verbatim the relevant statement so as not to mischaracterize . 
6843	1664	WE 've been socialist for 85 years now and done OK , have n't WE ? 
6844	1664	And WE need to restore revenues by increasing taxes . 
6845	1664	Sorry to hear about ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ churches . 
6846	1664	Do churches really get federal $ $ ? 
6847	1664	I guess that started during the Bush administration ? 
6848	1664	I had thought that was unconstitutional . 
6849	1664	OK , so ADMINISTRATION not health care after all that is responsible for tearing the nation down . 
6850	1664	We 've clarified that . 
6851	1664	Instead , it is the `` entire Obama package '' that makes those that have real money nervous that is tearing the country down . 
6852	1664	How is the `` entire Obama package '' doing that , and upon want facts or data , if any , do ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ have to demonstrate that is the cause ? 
6853	1665	I do n't think Medicare is akin to Insurance . 
6854	1665	SS is . 
6855	1665	If I said Medicare was I mis-spoke and withdraw MEDICARE . 
6856	1665	Medicare is Govt national health care , available only to those over 65 . 
6857	1665	MEDICARE 's not wrong at all . 
6858	1665	There is no contract that guarantees ASPECT_DAN40_ SS or medicare benefits . 
6859	1665	The fact ASPECT_DAN40_ paid taxes in life does give ASPECT_DAN40_ entitlements . 
6860	1665	I 've never claimed SS is an insurance policy . 
6861	1665	I 've said POLICY is social insurance , like insurance the pool resources and provide benefits if and only if certain conditions occur . 
6862	1665	I 've intimated nothing of the sort . 
6863	1665	Quit wasting I time with strawmen . 
6864	1665	I siad that insurance companies are for profit and therefore will endeavor to avoid paying benefits by excluding coverage on those more likely to meet the condition for benefits . 
6865	1665	Because COVERAGE is irrelevant . 
6866	1665	How do ASPECT_DAN40_ figure ? 
6867	1665	I position is logical and factually supported . 
6868	1666	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ do have a sense of humor ! 
6869	1667	If ASPECT_DAN40_ worked ASPECT_DAN40_ entire life , ASPECT_DAN40_ paid mega money into Medicare , they just borrowed LIFE and spent LIFE wrong ! 
6870	1667	-LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- Heathens ! 
6871	1667	MONEY 's ASPECT_DAN40_ own money being paid back to ASPECT_DAN40_ ... Unfortunately , HEATHENS manage MONEY incorrectly , MONEY should not be touched , ever ! 
6873	1670	This women represents the way Americans are feeling , unfortunately ! 
6876	1671	ASPECT_DAN40_ have a sense of dodging and dancing when ASPECT_DAN40_ have no argument . 
6877	1672	Ha Ha Ha , so funny and maybe true ... maybe not ... . 
6878	1673	I 've lumped all of the above in one quote , since all of it shows ASPECT_IRIEMON_ to have no knowledge of the country ASPECT_IRIEMON_ live in . 
6879	1673	The above programs , Medicare , and Social Security are each INSURANCE . 
6880	1673	Both are coverage in exchange for premiums . 
6881	1673	One is medical coverage , one is social coverage . 
6882	1673	And BOTH are our ONLY 2 `` ENTITLEMENT '' programs . 
6883	1673	Entitlements are bad mouthed on both sides of the aisle , but what BOTH are lumping in with M & SS are give away programs , which are not entitlements , BOTH are welfare , like subsidized housing , food stamps , Medicaid . 
6884	1673	OUR 2 real entitlement programs have PAID BOTH premiums . 
6885	1673	It is the politicians , both parties , that have blown the Med . 
6886	1673	& SS money on many things including the welfare programs listed above , that do not pay in a penny but take out Billions per year . 
6887	1673	But I digress , Medicare and Social Security are insurance programs MANDATED by the Govt . 
6888	1673	We do not have the choice of paying for BILLIONS or not . 
6889	1673	The premiums are taken in the form of FICA taxes . 
6890	1673	Are ASPECT_IRIEMON_ in any way aware of what F.I.C.A. means ? 
6891	1673	Federal INSURANCE Contributions Act . 
6892	1673	And is separate from income taxes . 
6893	1673	6.2 &#37; and 1.45 % of income is taken FOR Social Security and Medicare respectively . 
6894	1673	And both are means tested . 
6895	1673	Medicare the more ASPECT_IRIEMON_ 've made in ASPECT_IRIEMON_ working life , the more ASPECT_IRIEMON_ 've paid in , but ASPECT_IRIEMON_ receive only the exact same benefit of anyone that made minimum wage for only 40 quarters of BOTH working life . 
6896	1673	Plus if ASPECT_IRIEMON_ make over $ 100,000 and ASPECT_IRIEMON_ 're on Medicare , ASPECT_IRIEMON_ monthly premium is higher than people making less . 
6897	1673	Plus those in lower income ranges can have premiums lower or waived altogether and co-pays reduced or zeroed . 
6898	1673	Social Security , the more ASPECT_IRIEMON_ made , the more ASPECT_IRIEMON_ paid in , the more benefit ASPECT_IRIEMON_ receive . 
6899	1673	THAT is means testing . 
6900	1673	And if one is making over $ 108,000 . 
6901	1673	their SS tax stops , as does the accrual of any more benefit . 
6902	1673	Yes , those people will get the max SS payout , but PEOPLE also paid the highest PREMIUMS . 
6903	1673	And if PEOPLE are still making high incomes PEOPLE pay income tax on PEOPLE SS benefits at regular income tax rates on 50 % of the benefit , or 85 % of the benefit depending on PEOPLE income . 
6904	1673	People living on SS alone , do not pay any income tax on PEOPLE SS benefits . 
6905	1673	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ every post makes TAX obvious to all readers that ASPECT_IRIEMON_ either do hate the rich or ASPECT_IRIEMON_ have been ideologically brainwashed into reciting the present day liberal line . 
6906	1673	In years past the liberal line was TAX BIG BUSINESS . 
6907	1673	But when PEOPLE realized that the public KNEW that just meant higher prices , liberals changed to the `` hate the rich '' nonsense . 
6908	1673	And ASPECT_IRIEMON_ have quite obviously bought into that stupidity , wholeheartedly . 
6909	1673	Again ASPECT_IRIEMON_ basic misconceptions about insurance show through . 
6910	1673	Excluding coverage for those WITH pre-existing conditions is done , with 100 % approval of insurance regulators -LRB- elected or appointed politicians -RRB- , solely to keep premiums lower for those who are transferring risk to the insurance company in exchange for a premium . 
6911	1673	Covering anyone already needing treatment is transferring COST , not risk . 
6912	1673	RISK is a necessary factor in the insurance equation . 
6913	1673	Insurance companies CAN NOT be in the business of taking on COSTS , COMPANIES have to take on RISK . 
6914	1673	Do n't know why ASPECT_IRIEMON_ are UNABLE to grasp that simple concept . 
6915	1673	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ position is one of misconception , and ideological nonsense , and distortions . 
6916	1673	And I was being kind to say ASPECT_IRIEMON_ have a sense of humor . 
6917	1673	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ fuzzy glimpse of reality is sad , not funny . 
6918	1673	If I was predisposed to feel sorry for people , I 'm not , I 'd feel sorry for ASPECT_IRIEMON_ 
6919	1674	I can see ASPECT_DAN40_ point . 
6920	1674	I 'll agree medicare is like insurance to , in a way . 
6921	1674	ASPECT_DAN40_ seem to have the mistaken impression that a political view that the wealthy ought to pay more taxes equates to hate . 
6922	1674	Of course IMPRESSION does n't . 
6923	1674	Cost is a function of risk . 
6924	1674	I completely understand that a person who is aged or has a pre-existing condition carries a greater risk of higher cost . 
6925	1674	That is why for profit private insurers will seek to cut out such persons . 
6926	1674	And why a system of private insurance does not work for national heath care . 
6927	1674	I disagree with ASPECT_DAN40_ opinions . 
6928	1674	Others can decide for OTHERS . 
6929	1674	I can tell ASPECT_DAN40_ are not the kind who would feel sorry for people . 
6930	1675	And I am very comfortable with that . 
6931	1675	Feeling sorry for people instead of demanding PEOPLE get off PEOPLE ass and haul PEOPLE own load is about 70 % of our problems in this country . 
6932	1675	I did the `` red thing '' because THING pleases ASPECT_IRIEMON_ so . 
6933	1675	See I have a sense of macabre , err , humor too 
6934	1677	There 's no legal contract with SS , and LIBERAL 'm pretty sure medicare as well . 
6935	1677	Again , LIBERAL have no surprise ASPECT_DAN40_ are not the kind would not feel sorry for people and are comfortable with CONTRACT . 
6936	1677	SURPRISE 's why ASPECT_DAN40_ are a conservative and LIBERAL 'm a liberal . 
6937	1678	EVERY Bush tax cut did several things ... 1 .

VOTE DEMOCRAT and SUPPORT , President Obama and the USA ! 
6957	1679	Then pay ASPECT_IRIEMON_ own liberal way and do n't bother us that do n't live in an impossible dream world . 
6958	1680	I pay I own way . 
6960	1681	No ASPECT_IRIEMON_ do not . 
6961	1681	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ demand that people above $ 200,000 pay more taxes so liberals can waste the money on useless social programs . 
6962	1681	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ want those social programs , ASPECT_IRIEMON_ pay for PEOPLE . 
6963	1681	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ 'll gladly sign an opt out form so that ASPECT_IRIEMON_ can not participate in ASPECT_IRIEMON_ liberal Utopian dreamworld . 
6964	1681	But ASPECT_IRIEMON_ refuse to pay any more for stupidity that does not work . 
6965	1682	That is not true . 
6966	1682	THAT demand that people pay more taxes to reduce the huge debt ASPECT_DAN40_ conservatives love to run up . 
6967	1683	We love to run up ? 
6968	1683	wow , do WE need to show ASPECT_IRIEMON_ the statistics about Obama compared to Bush ? 
6969	1683	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ really seem to be mis-informed . 
6970	1684	Check the statistics of Reagan , Bush and Bush compared to Clinton or any president between WWII and Reagan and find out I 'm not . 
6971	1685	Pardon SHOEY but `` We The People '' bailed out the banks , Wall Street and General Motors . 
6972	1685	SHOEY demand retribution and propose legislation for a 1 &#37; tax on all stock market exchanges , 1 % tax on all bank transactions and a 1 % tax on every GM automobile sold , new or used . 
6973	1685	90 % of that revenue generated from those taxes will be used as a down payment on The National Debt -LRB- Public Debt -RRB- and the remaining 10 % will be dispersed in checks back to U.S. citizens who pay taxes . 
6974	1685	SHOEY am Shoey and this message is surely not White House approved . 
6975	1686	GIVEN , the past was bad . 
6976	1686	How does that make BHO , spending at a faster rate than any of the past pres ' GOOD ? 
6977	1686	PRES were bad , GIVEN is equally guilty and then some . 
6978	1686	Before HIM make some LAME AZZ excuse for him -LRB- the hallmark of GIVEN presidency -RRB- All the bad past people had `` good '' reasons for PRES spending too . 
6979	1686	Out of control spending IS out of control spending , no matter WHAT the supposed reason . 
6980	1686	Then and NOW !! 
6981	1687	i WILL NOT VOTE FOR HIM AGAIN , HIM DOES NOT HAVE A CLUE ! 
6982	1688	What was the good reason for Bush squandering a surplus and running up $ 5 trillion in debt ? 
6983	1688	What was the good reason for Reagan taking a small deficit and quadrupling DEFICIT and tripling the debt ? 
6984	1688	Obama inherited the worst economic situation since the great depression that mandated fiscal stimulus . 
6985	1688	I agree OBAMA needs to reduce the deficits and should raise taxes and trim spending . 
6986	1688	I 've said SITUATION many times . 
6987	1689	What ASPECT_IRIEMON_ can not comprehend is that they always have a `` good '' reason . 
6988	1689	Same as obummer has a `` good '' reason . 
6989	1689	But THEY good reason AND obummer 's good reasons are simply excuses put out by the spenders . 
6990	1689	THERE is no good reasons for spending Trillions we do not have . 
6991	1689	There was no good reason then , there is no good reason now . 
6992	1689	And ASPECT_IRIEMON_ need to study history with ASPECT_IRIEMON_ eyes and ears and mind open . 
6993	1689	What obummer faced and faces is about 1\/2 as bad as what Reagan faced . 
6994	1689	Less than half actually . 
6995	1689	Same bad economy , same bad unemployment PLUS massive DOUBLE DIGIT INFLATION . 
6996	1689	I lived and worked in those days . 
6997	1689	If a person made a $ 2000 IRA contribution to a bank for 22 years , at the interest rate banks were paying for an ordinary CD , they would become a millionaire . 
6998	1689	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ could go to the grocery store a week later and buy the exact same grocery list and pay $ 20 , $ 25.00 more for the same goods . 
6999	1689	Did Reagan BELIEVE BELIEVE had a good reason for spending like BELIEVE did ? 
7000	1689	Sure BELIEVE did . 
7001	1689	But we are paying today for the precedent BELIEVE set then . 
7002	1689	Same as WE will pay for obummer 's idiocy . 
7003	1689	WE will suffer in the future for obummer 's policies today , PLUS inflation WILL run wild again . 
7004	1689	A chemo treatment that is 100 % effective against cancer is useless if PLAN also kills the patient . 
7005	1689	That was oBum 's treatment plan except that PLAN is killing the patient AND PLAN is not effective . 
7006	1689	But PLAN IS more expensive than anything else ever tried in history . 
7007	1690	During a sever recession there are very good reasons to increase spending . 
7008	1690	A creates demand and picks up slack caused by the overreaction of the markets and economy to lessen the full effect of the recession or recessionary spiral into depression . 
7009	1690	Interest rates were high because of the Fed 's actions to kill inflation , but Reagan inhereted an economy where the relative size of the debt was the lowest in 45 years and the economy was growing at 7 + &#37; real . 
7010	1690	Obama inherited record deficits , the highest relative debt in 60 years , and an economy tanking at -7 % real . 
7011	1690	Easy choice which one I 'd rather walk into . 
7012	1690	Depends on what ASPECT_DAN40_ mean . 
7013	1690	Relatively the Govt spent far more on WWII and probably close to the same for Reagans military buildup . 
7014	1690	And in perspective , the spending on the stimulus is no more than the cost of the mistaken Iraq war , and really only a couple years extra annual military spending compared to 2000 . 
7015	1692	Not true . 
7016	1692	Obama has spent like a mad man . 
7017	1692	Keep drinking the kool-aid . 
7019	1692	ASPECT_ARES_ mean accept . 
7020	1692	Not going to matter in November once the republicans control everything , have fun ... ASPECT_ARES_ only have a few months left . 
7021	1692	Please elaborate on the good choices . 
7022	1692	I ca n't seem to think of any , oh that 's because there are none . 
7023	1692	Everything COMMANDER does is to redistribute wealth . 
7024	1692	The unemployment rate has gone way up . 
7025	1692	COMMANDER lied many times about health care . 
7026	1692	The problem is COMMANDER does everything that is unpopular . 
7027	1692	COMMANDER is supposed to follow what the people want . 
7028	1692	Everything COMMANDER does is opposite of the public opinion . 
7029	1692	In other words there are more people upset than happy . 
7030	1692	Yeah since COMMANDER had a choice Obama has only continued the war , drones left and right . 
7031	1692	Well COMMANDER is the commander in chief , that is COMMANDER job . 
7032	1692	As for the criticism ... People are finally catching on to COMMANDER non-sense , even the people who fell for CRITICISM in the first place . 
7033	1692	Hell yes we are going to criticize NON-SENSE when NON-SENSE is spending WE money like MONEY grows on trees to give to people who do NOTHING . 
7034	1692	No , NO does n't . 
7035	1692	WE are n't moving to a socialist\/communist nation . 
7036	1692	Why give someone a second chance ? 
7037	1692	NO 's not going to change NO ideas . 
7038	1692	NO is set on running America straight into the ground . 
7039	1694	ASPECT_DAN40_ 're right . 
7040	1694	They have nothing to run on . 
7041	1694	Only bash the other side . 
7042	1695	DEMOCRAT CAMPAIGN TOPICS , Its Bush 's fault . 
7043	1695	Tax the rich . 
7044	1695	FAULT 's FOX 's fault . 
7045	1695	Spend more , but do n't call FAULT Stimulus . 
7046	1695	FAULT 's Beck 's fault . 
7047	1695	Tax the rich . 
7048	1695	FAULT was worse then we `` thought . 
7049	1695	`` Spend more . 
7050	1695	Barak who ? 
7051	1695	Tax the rich . 
7052	1695	The people are dumb ! 
7053	1695	Spend more . 
7054	1695	FAULT the tea party 's fault . 
7055	1695	Tax the rich . 
7056	1695	Conservative 's are racist . 
7057	1695	Spend more . 
7058	1695	Give us time , US 've only had control since 1\/2007 ! 
7059	1695	Tax the rich . 
7060	1695	The tea party is dangerous . 
7061	1695	Spend more . 
7062	1695	FAULT somebody else 's fault . 
7063	1695	Tax the rich . 
7064	1695	Republican 's just say no , FAULT not our fault . 
7065	1695	Spend more . 
7066	1695	The tea party is racist . 
7067	1695	XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XNO Platform , NO programs other than spend wildly . 
7068	1695	Just whine and blame everybody but themselves . 
7069	1696	Foregoing the obvious quip about a certain other recent President , US 'd have to nominate James K Polk as the worst President in US history , considering the fact that PRESIDENT started a blatant war of aggression and territorial expansion on the flimsiest of pretexts , and nearly started another war with Britain for similar reasons . 
7070	1696	As for Obama , US would say that OBAMA 's done a remarkable job under very adverse circumstances , and even if OBAMA Presidency ended today , OBAMA 'd be remembered as a notable President with many accomplishments . 
7071	1696	Let 's examine 'S point by point : - `` OBAMA has not kept most of OBAMA campaign promises . '' 
7073	1696	Let 's check . 
7074	1696	Health care reform ? 
7076	1696	Economic stimulus ? 
7078	1696	Financial reform ? 
7080	1696	Winding down the war in Iraq ? 
7082	1696	Sending more forces to Afghanistan ? 
7084	1696	Improving the nation 's infrastructure ? 
7086	1696	Building a green economy ? 
7088	1696	Err , which promises did ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ have in mind , exactly ? 
7089	1696	For a more complete rundown on promises kept or broken , look here : http:\/\/politifact.com\/truth-o-meter\/promises\/ - `` ERR has not been transparent . 
7090	1696	`` Compared to what ? 
7091	1696	Luminiferous aether ? 
7092	1696	While Obama certainly could have done better in this regard , COMPARED 's certainly made improvements compared to COMPARED predecessors . 
7093	1696	For example , ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ can track exactly where the stimulus money is going at http:\/\/www.recovery.gov\/Pages\/home.aspx - `` ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ has\/will raise taxes on everyone -LRB- no tax cut for 95 % of Americans -RRB- . 
7094	1696	`` Well duh . 
7095	1696	Anyone who was elected President in 2008 would have had to raise taxes at some point . 
7096	1696	The Bush tax cuts were simply irresponsible and unsustainable . 
7097	1696	- `` BUSH has increased spending\/size of government to record levels . 
7098	1696	`` ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ 're talking about the stimulus bill ? 
7099	1696	BUSH will remind ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ that two years ago economists from all over the political spectrum were warning of the very real danger of a second Great Depression . 
7100	1696	In case ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ 've forgotten ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ high school history , the Great Depression involved unemployment rates in the neighborhood of 25 % , thousands of bank failures , huge numbers of American forced to lived in Hoovervilles - makeshift camps for the homeless . 
7101	1696	ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ really think averting economic collapse is n't worth spending money on ? 
7102	1696	- `` ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ has \/ will increase THOUSANDS deficit to record levels . 
7103	1696	`` So a huge recurring , structural deficit to fund tax cuts for the rich is okie-dokie , but a one time emergency expenditure is the end of the world ? 
7104	1696	And were n't ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ just complaining about taxes being raised ? 
7105	1696	Make up ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ mind - ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ ca n't have ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ cake and eat CAKE too . 
7106	1696	- `` ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ ignores The People and pushes through legislation any way ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ can . 
7107	1696	`` Errr , were n't ERRR criticizing Clinton just a few years ago for making policy decisions based on polling ? 
7108	1696	And ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ seem to recall pretty constant complaints about a `` Do nothing Congress . '' 
7109	1696	ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ should really make up ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ mind which ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ want . 
7110	1696	- `` ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ has weakened national security\/border security . 
7111	1696	`` How exactly ? 
7112	1696	Obama has reduced the stress on a severely overextended US military . 
7113	1696	Our world standing has greatly improved and OUR 're seeing much more cooperation both from traditional allies and from other world powers such as Russia and China . 
7114	1696	Honestly , just running around the world threatening to bomb anyone OUR do n't like does not make the US any more secure . 
7115	1696	Considering that JUST greatly reduces the credibility of threats of military force , ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ 'd say JUST does the opposite . 
7116	1696	As for the border , if anything , Obama has increased border enforcement compared to Bush . 
7117	1696	- `` OBAMA has several proposed policies that will hurt Americans and OUR economy . 
7118	1696	`` Such as what ? 
7119	1696	OBAMA really have no idea what ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ 're on about with this one . 
7120	1696	ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ consider an economic policy that leads to 9 % unemployment rather then 25 % to have hurt the economy ? 
7121	1696	How exactly do ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ figure that ? 
7122	1696	- `` ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ is shunning our allies and kissing the asses of OUR enemies . 
7123	1696	`` Anyone who ever uttered the words `` freedom fries '' has absolutely no room to speak on this subject . 
7124	1696	Real friends tell ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ when ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ 're making a mistake . 
7125	1696	People who simply go along with anything and everything ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ want are n't friends , PEOPLE 're sycophants . 
7126	1696	And have ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ ever considered actually asking our allies what ALLIES think of the matter ? 
7127	1696	Obama is very popular in Europe and the rest of the world . 
7128	1696	US happened to be on a trip to England on election day 2008 -LRB- US voted by absentee ballot -RRB- and when US went to the airport to come back , the guy at the customs desk gave US a hearty congratulations on Obama 's election when GUY saw US US passport . 
7129	1696	As for OUR enemies , Iran , at least , is in a much , much weaker position now then IRAN was two years ago . 
7130	1696	Between internal dissension -LRB- Which Obama encouraged by holding out a hand in OBAMA inaugural -RRB- and growing international opposition -LRB- Thanks to Obama engaging in actual \* diplomacy \* -RRB- Ahmadinejad 's regime has gone from being on the verge of regional domination to severely hemmed in and with few options . 
7131	1696	- `` OBAMA continues to spew lies and BS to the American people . 
7132	1696	`` Unless ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ 'd care to provide actual examples , this is a meaningless insult on about the level of accusing Obama of having cooties . 
7133	1696	To sum up , although Obama has been far from perfect and can certainly be criticized on many points , over all OBAMA 's done quite a good job under very adverse circumstances . 
7134	1696	Yes , the economy still sucks , but ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ know what ? 
7135	1696	The President ca n't simply order prosperity to return . 
7136	1696	The US economy is a massive thing with a mind of THING own that the government has only limited means to influence . 
7137	1696	There really is n't a magic wand in a safe in the White House somewhere . 
7138	1696	Well , unless ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ 're advocating a change to a command economy ... Things are much better then they would have been otherwise . 
7139	1696	Why Democrats are n't running on this is a puzzle to US . 
7140	1696	Some commentators seem to think that is too complex an argument for American voters to grasp . 
7141	1696	US sincerely hope COMMENTATORS 're wrong . 
7142	1696	So yes , US will very likely vote to re-elect Obama . 
7143	1696	And no , US almost certainly would n't vote for Palin . 
7144	1696	Regardless of what ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ think of NO politics , Palin has demonstrated a disturbingly weak grasp of the issues and NO competence to perform the duties of the office are questionable at best . 
7145	1697	REPUBLICAN CAMPAIGN TOPICSIts Obama 's fault . 
7146	1697	Cut taxes for rich . 
7147	1697	FAULT 's MSM 's fault . 
7148	1697	Spend more , but do n't call FAULT Stimulus . 
7149	1697	FAULT 's Biden 's fault . 
7150	1697	Cut taxes for rich . 
7151	1697	It is worse that FAULT is . 
7152	1697	Borrow more . 
7153	1697	Sarah who ? 
7154	1697	Cut taxes for the rich . 
7155	1697	The people are dumb ! 
7156	1697	Borrow more . 
7157	1697	Its the tea party 's fault . 
7158	1697	Cut taxes for the rich . 
7159	1697	Obama is a racist . 
7160	1697	Spend more . 
7161	1697	Kick them out , THEM 've had control since Jan 2009 ! 
7162	1697	Cut taxes for the rich . 
7163	1697	The liberals are dangerous . 
7164	1697	Borrow more . 
7165	1697	Its somebody else 's fault . 
7166	1697	Cut taxes for the rich . 
7167	1697	Everything is Obama 's fault . 
7168	1697	Spend more . 
7169	1697	Blacks are racists . 
7170	1697	Cut taxes for the rich . 
7171	1698	He certainly was not one of our best . 
7172	1698	I almost fell off I chair laughing at this one . 
7173	1698	Most of these promises kept will be detrimental to our economy . 
7174	1698	HE stimulus certainly has not panned out . 
7175	1698	Obamacare will most certainly be disastrous , and most Americans favor a repeal . 
7176	1698	OBAMA is doing somewhat better , I believe , but not to the degree OBAMA said OBAMA would , and certainly only after pressure to do so . 
7177	1698	OBAMA stimulus is very questionable at to whether STIMULUS had any affect on our economy other than increasing the deficit . 
7178	1698	One-time emergency expenditure ? 
7179	1698	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ have n't been paying attention to Obama spending and the projected deficits OBAMA will incur . 
7180	1698	They are history-making and record-breaking . 
7181	1698	I was not complaining about Clinton , personally . 
7182	1698	Most Americans were against Obamacare because most Americans know SPENDING will not do what Obama thinks SPENDING will . 
7183	1698	Obama is viewed as weak by many countries . 
7184	1698	OBAMA apology tour certainly has not helped . 
7185	1698	Most of Obama 's actions on the border were lip service . 
7186	1698	National guards troops without enforcement authority or loaded weapons . 
7187	1698	OBAMA 600 million increase in border funding is a drop in the bucket of what OBAMA should be doing . 
7188	1698	Hid DOHS has suspended several administrative checks regarding status of folks in the U.S. that allows for more illegal activity . 
7189	1698	OBAMA said STATUS would stay under 8 % , yet has gone to 10 % . 
7190	1698	What makes ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ think OBAMA had anything to do with the numbers not getting worse ? 
7191	1698	Maybe FOLKS would not have reached 10 % if Obama left the private sector alone and did n't spend like Paris Hilton on Rodeo Drive . 
7192	1698	OBAMA may have been popular before the election , and shortly thereafter , but now OBAMA is not . 
7193	1698	I am in Europe at least once a month on business , and OBAMA is not that popular anymore . 
7194	1698	Most folks view Obama as just a typical politician and more of the same . 
7195	1698	Obama continues to live in a pipe dream believing OBAMA policies are helping our economy . 
7196	1698	OBAMA pushes Obamacare even though many fear DREAM , and most Americans want DREAM repealed . 
7197	1698	The scary thing is that I really think Obama thinks OBAMA is right with OBAMA policies , even though many are against OBAMA . 
7198	1698	Just speculation . 
7199	1698	I am not sure Palin is the right person for the job . 
7200	1698	I certainly think that PERSON is a smart lady , and just does n't act like a typical politician . 
7201	1698	PERSON could certainly do no worse that Obama , IMO . 
7202	1698	Obama is a good BS-er . 
7203	1698	OBAMA actually had no experience or credentials to be POTUS . 
7204	1698	EXPERIENCE is also very clear , according to this poll , that Obama is not very popular anymore . 
7206	1699	- ASPECT_DAN40_ must be filthy rich or just a committed tea party enthusiast . 
7207	1699	ASPECT_DAN40_ travel only to this thread , and every time , ASPECT_DAN40_ see multiple posts by ASPECT_DAN40_ that are nothing more than opinionated nonsense , full of tea party rhetoric that ANY knowledgable , in touch person can refute . 
7208	1699	And , when they do -- as ASPECT_DAN40_ have on occasion -- the DAN-NO rebuttal is more of the same opinionated nonsense . 
7209	1699	Like MOST conservatives , ASPECT_DAN40_ posts reveal that ASPECT_DAN40_ `` think ? '' 
7210	1699	posting the same stuff over and over will convince others ASPECT_DAN40_ have an argument . 
7211	1699	B -- O -- R -- ASPECT_DAN40_ -- N -- G !!!!!! 
7212	1699	ASPECT_DAN40_ are like a biting fly that pesters a person until the only solution is a `` swat , '' so , here 's mine -- 
7213	1700	Please tell me one thing that 's incorrect on his list ... ONE thing 
7214	1701	First , ASPECT_SASSY_ do n't know what the tea party is . 
7215	1701	ASPECT_SASSY_ only know what ASPECT_SASSY_ brainwashing elitists tell ASPECT_SASSY_ to think . 
7216	1701	The tea party , simply put , is the overwhelming majority of American Citizens . 
7217	1701	Mainstream America IS the tea party , some actually join , others are just sympathetic to tea party ideas . 
7218	1701	And everything I posted that elicited ASPECT_SASSY_ derogatory quote is an accurate depiction of liberal statements . 
7219	1701	Made over and over and over . 
7220	1701	B -- O -- R -- I -- N -- G !!!!!! 
7221	1701	Yes conservatives DO have opinions , based in reality and truth . 
7222	1701	ASPECT_SASSY_ quote PROVES that liberals have opinions too . 
7223	1701	Based in beautiful theories that can not continue . 
7224	1701	ASPECT_SASSY_ liberals want all things for all persons , beautiful , a wonderful goal . 
7225	1701	Talk to CHARITIES , not Governments . 
7226	1702	READERS Please Note !!! 
7227	1702	Conservatives like to hawk READERS `` views '' but seldom supply any `` unbiased '' sources for CONSERVATIVES `` facts . '' 
7228	1702	Research of CONSERVATIVES `` facts '' shows a heavy , fundamental reliance on Republican\/Tea Party propaganda . 
7229	1702	When challenged for CONSERVATIVES propaganda , CONSERVATIVES change the subject or ignore the challenge completely . 
7230	1702	Thus , this is NOT debate , but a biased , single minded rehearsed tirade of unfounded , opinionated rhetoric . 
7231	1702	Now , I am quick to remind all that NOW 's perfectly OK to have an opinion and to post OPINION no matter how perverse or ill-advised , BUT , in this American democracy , we the people , have the means to research such material and when one does , one is not surprised to discover just how slanted and unfounded conservative propaganda is . 
7232	1702	Here 's an example : Both DAN-NO40 and Onalandline deride the `` Stimulus . '' 
7233	1702	How about the report just released today by the WH and confirmed in this article in The Washington Post : Report gives stimulus high marks by Lori Montgomery . 
7234	1702	Read REPORT and judge for ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ . 
7235	1702	Facts are facts and opinion is just that -- opinion ! 
7236	1704	TRIFLE may be that 20 years is ASPECT_SFJEFF_ `` Right '' time to evaluate the current president , but TRIFLE 's a trifle `` long '' term for me -- and perhaps for ASPECT_SFJEFF_ depending upon ASPECT_SFJEFF_ age . 
7237	1704	ME was around when Reagan was president and even tho ' ME voted for Nixon , ME found Reagan to be a B-picture actor `` acting '' like a president . 
7238	1704	REAGAN best performance was convincing everyone REAGAN was a `` good '' president . 
7239	1704	Further , REAGAN likely had Alzheimer 's when REAGAN was in the WH , and it was reported that REAGAN was often caught ` nodding ' off during meetings . 
7240	1704	Personally , ME prefer to depend on someone who CAN be aroused at 2 AM with an emergency . 
7241	1704	ME am an Independent , and ME agree that Bratboy Bush was the worst president during ME lifetime . 
7242	1704	ME did not support Obama during the 2008 campaign -LRB- ME supported Hillary and was very angry with the DNC for taking Texas away from HILLARY and ` giving ' TEXAS to Obama and for ignoring the 18 million votes HILLARY got nationally . 
7243	1704	ME blame Ted Kennedy for that bit of ` political slight of hand . ' 
7244	1704	ME never supported any Kennedy , either -RRB- . 
7245	1704	But , there is NO way ME can support the political perfidy that permeates the Republican party since Reagan . 
7246	1704	These people are ` off the charts ' when THE comes to reason and proffering PEOPLE ` facts ' as truth . 
7247	1704	PEOPLE are pro-wealth and corporate personhood -LRB- Corporations are NOT human and have only one purpose : to make a profit . 
7248	1704	The Constitution was written FOR the preservation of ` human ' life , liberty and pursuit of happiness , NOT profit -RRB- . 
7249	1704	CONSTITUTION is ME opinion that the conservatives on the SCOTUS are a group of anti-Constitutional nincompoops ! 
7250	1704	The best thing that Obama has done so far , in ME view , is to nominate 2 more women to the Court . 
7251	1704	These brilliant women have faced the slings and arrows of sex discrimination by the `` good ole boys ' club '' and likely will write opinions based on humanitarian rather than corporate needs when WOMEN must judge some of the crackpot laws the Republican dominated Congress passed and both GWB and WJC signed into law . 
7252	1704	As for the so called ` blue dog ' democrats , DEMOCRATS 're now simply out of the closet homogametic republicans . 
7253	1704	May DEMOCRATS rue DEMOCRATS votes to DEMOCRATS political deathbed . 
7254	1706	ASPECT_SASSY_ have serious issues and should seek counseling ! 
7255	1706	And `` POLITICIANS LIE '' is not a newsflash . 
7256	1706	Both parties are and have been guilty of taking anything out of context and using NEWSFLASH to PARTIES best advantage . 
7257	1706	For instance , Reid did say what REID is claimed to have said , THAT IS A FACT . 
7258	1706	Using FACT in a manner other than how REID meant FACT IS politics . 
7259	1706	Simple fact , obummer came in with 69 % approval . 
7260	1706	Today only 30 % of the public says PUBLIC would vote to re-elect REID . 
7261	1706	That 's the public saying that , not the politicians . 
7262	1707	Go to the log Cabin republicans.com and see gay people who are normal , the media reports them undignified on purpose ... Democrats exploit THEM and give THEM hope in every election , but never deliver ... Jollee 
7263	1709	hELL NO ! 
7264	1709	tHATS LIKE ASKING ME IF i WANT THE ECONOMY TOO FAIL FOREVER ! 
7266	1710	I think the failure of the economy would do us some good . 
7267	1710	FAILURE would highlight the inherent failings of Capitalism . 
7268	1710	Capitalism is UNSUSTAINABLE . 
7269	1710	Capitalism is defined by competition . 
7270	1710	The question our generation -LRB- the breathing -RRB- faces , is this : what happens when someone wins ? 
7271	1710	The power wielded by the winners - that is all I want folks to contemplate . 
7273	1713	Readers , please note : The White House ? 
7274	1713	The Washington Post ? 
7275	1713	Certainly unbiased sources . 
7278	1714	Are ASPECT_SASSY_ serious ? 
7279	1714	One of the most biased websites owned by some Obama cronies . 
7280	1715	Power wielded by winners is clearly thousands of percentage points better than power wielded by LOSERS . 
7281	1715	Humans have brains that allow us to out think other animals . 
7282	1715	And US make better use of tools than other animals . 
7283	1715	But make no mistake , US live in the same jungle as all the other animals do . 
7284	1715	Ours is often made of concrete and steel now , instead of trees . 
7285	1715	But US only changed CONCRETE appearance , JUNGLE still a jungle and always will be . 
7286	1715	And losers do not rule any jungle anywhere . 
7287	1715	And never will . 
7288	1715	Capitalism IS the unbreakable law of the jungle . 
7289	1715	Liberalism can temporarily prostitute that law , but LAW can not even begin to fundamentally change LAW . 
7290	1715	Those that want to live productive lives and prosper , will ! 
7291	1715	The others will get only what OTHERS have earned . 
7292	1715	To say , `` Capitalism is UNSUSTAINABLE , '' is to be completely out of touch with reality . 
7293	1716	All we would have needed it 3 republicans to believe in gay rights and WE would have had open gays in the military . 
7294	1716	3 republicans . 
7295	1716	Do n't give me that democrats do n't deliver -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- . 
7296	1716	DEMOCRATS worked DEMOCRATS ass off for gay rights and the republicans said no to yet another civil rights issue . 
7297	1717	Now , for another lesson in ` truthiness : `` Therefore , if ASPECT_DAN40_ KNOW what a politician or pundit says is a lie , then NOW 's ` freedom of speech ' for ASPECT_DAN40_ to continue to spread that lie ? 
7298	1717	On what moral compass do ASPECT_DAN40_ set that philosophy ? 
7299	1717	On what the serpent in the Garden of Eden had to say , perhaps ? 
7300	1717	That 's the kind of collective dishonesty that the tea party and THEREFORE conservative fellow travelers use to spread TRAVELERS unAmerican philosophy of ' political hatred , ' and TRAVELERS unreasonable goal to foster governmental turmoil and eventual destruction in a stable democracy . 
7301	1717	How can the tea party\/conservative Republican party justify that philosophy without undermining the Constitutional ideals of ` human ' life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness and that ` all men -LRB- mankind -RRB- are created equal ? ' 
7302	1717	Again , Obama 's popularity is NOT the question supporting this thread . 
7303	1717	YEARS 's , `` Would ASPECT_DAN40_ vote for Obama in 2010 ? '' 
7304	1717	That 's 2 years from now . 
7305	1717	In politics , that 's an eternity . 
7306	1717	IOW , just another example of conservative distraction and manipulation to distort the facts to suit ASPECT_DAN40_ political purposes . 
7307	1717	Some of us are not so intellectually ignorant or ` needy ' for political ` purification . ' 
7308	1718	Since ASPECT_SASSY_ have hooked up the tea party and conservatives Republicans , it is obvious that ASPECT_SASSY_ have not looked into it for ASPECT_SASSY_ . 
7309	1718	ASPECT_SASSY_ are simply repeating and spreading liberal lies . 
7310	1718	What conservative Republicans , or moderate Republicans , or radical Republicans , have to say does not matter to me any more than what Democrats of any ilk have to say . 
7311	1718	The Republican Party does not speak for the tea party and the tea party does not speak for the Republican Party . 
7312	1718	Democrats and Republicans ARE political parties . 
7313	1718	The tea party is not a political party , PARTY is a grass roots movement of the MAJORITY of the American public . 
7314	1718	PARTY does not speak with one voice , nor is PARTY coordinated . 
7315	1718	The liberal media demonizes the tea party because PARTIES fear PARTY . 
7316	1718	Not for violence , but that the liberal media is afraid of losing PARTY power . 
7317	1718	And POWER will , precisely because the media SHOULD be reporting facts and events as PARTIES ARE , NOT as PARTIES 'd like PARTIES to be . 
7318	1718	Rather than vomiting out the pablum ASPECT_SASSY_ liberal loonies have taught ASPECT_SASSY_ , ASPECT_SASSY_ should go and see the tea party for ASPECT_SASSY_ and with an open mind . 
7319	1718	What ASPECT_SASSY_ will see is AMERICA working the way it is supposed to work . 
7320	1718	For the people , by the people . 
7321	1718	ASPECT_SASSY_ should be embracing real America rather than helping spread lies by elitists afraid of losing PEOPLE powers . 
7322	1718	The tea party is not a political party , but AMERICA is already larger than either the Democratic Party or the Republican Party . 
7323	1719	Are ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ claiming that the washington post has a liberal bias ??? 
7324	1719	: Laughing : Maybe that was the case in 1970 , but that is certainly not the case in 2010 . 
7325	1719	If anything , the Post has a right wing bias , not the other way around . 
7326	1720	The vote was 56 to 43 . 
7327	1720	Yet there are only 41 Republicans . 
7328	1720	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ DID NOT get the Democratic\/Independent vote EITHER . 
7329	1720	So HOW is HOW the Republicans fault ? 
7330	1720	Why are ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ not pointing the finger at ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ dissenting Democrats ????? 
7331	1720	For well over a year Democrats had held a 60 to 40 super majority . 
7332	1720	Yet they constantly claimed Republicans were blocking everything , a mathematical impossibility . 
7333	1720	Now the Dems hold a 59 to 41 advantage . 
7334	1720	When the vote is 59 to 41 , THEN ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ can gripe about Republicans , but 43 never is 59-41 . 
7335	1720	Get ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ own group in order , then complain . 
7336	1720	Until then blaming Republicans is just another in the long , long , line of liberal excuses and avoiding the blame for THEN own shortcomings . 
7337	1721	LIBERAL could n't possibly agree with ASPECT_DAN40_ more , and LIBERAL am a liberal . 
7338	1721	It is a lie to convince people who are left wing to continue to support the corporatist , decidedly not left wing Democratic party . 
7339	1721	So PEOPLE lie and blame Republicans . 
7340	1721	Well many Democrats are not that stupid . 
7341	1721	Many Democrats understand math , and know that for about a year , Democrats could have done whatever PEOPLE felt like . 
7342	1721	PEOPLE could have passed progressive health care reform , that included a public option . 
7343	1721	Health care reform that benefited the American people , by insuring the uninsured and lowering premiums for the rest of us . 
7344	1721	Instead what US got was a handout to insurance companies . 
7345	1721	COMPANIES continue to try to blame Republicans for COMPANIES lack of progress , but the reality is COMPANIES are owned by the same corporate and special interests that Republicans are . 
7346	1721	COMPANIES have simply convinced people COMPANIES are the party of the people . 
7347	1721	That is a lie , US have 2 parties of the rich and powerful , and none who are for the poor or more importantly the middle class . 
7348	1722	When we really think about it , IT 's astonishing how much influence the Blue Dogs in the Senate have . 
7349	1722	Their actions eventually led to the public option being dropped , resulting in poor legislation that is a major reason Democrats are being -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- ted on in the polls . 
7350	1723	I do n't even think it is only the Blue Dogs anyways . 
7351	1723	Ultimately the Blue Dogs are beholden to the Democratic party leadership . 
7352	1723	If the party does not fund their campaigns , THEIR will have a hard time raising money THEIR , unless THEIR are particularly charismatic . 
7353	1723	TIME is the fault of the Democratic party leadership . 
7354	1723	THEIR could have gotten a better health care bill through if THEIR had the political will to do so , but THEIR did n't . 
7355	1724	Well that 's included in the whole situation but allow THAT to do what THAT want and we see what happened . 
7356	1724	If OBAMA 'm Reid , Pelosi , Obama , and the DNC leadership OBAMA tell THAT to back this or GONNA 're gonna have to end up passing crappy legislation , which is what happened . 
7357	1724	Ultimately , one party is out of THAT collective minds , and the other is too much of a wuss to get anything substantial done . 
7358	1726	More than conservatives . 
7359	1726	Obama has been at odds with the American people on almost every issue since OBAMA took office . 
7361	1727	The guy has been giving campaign speeches and pushing GUY agenda at full speed since taking office . 
7362	1728	So ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ subtract $ 288 billion from the total stimulus and divide that remainder by the 2.5 million jobs that will eventually be created and ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ get that each job has cost $ 210,400.00 . 
7363	1728	This ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ consider good ? 
7364	1728	This ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ consider a good reason to go another trillion dollars in debt ? 
7365	1728	The New Orleans levees ? 
7366	1728	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ have spent many billions to fix and improve the levees over the last 100 years . 
7367	1728	Not 10 cents on the dollar has ever reached the levees . 
7369	1728	AND N.O. could teach Chicago things about corruption and graft , and that is really saying something . 
7370	1728	And the infrastructure ? 
7371	1728	Indeed do the repairs , that was what the `` shovel ready '' projects were supposed to be all about . 
7372	1728	But then WHY did obummer ask , within the last month , for ANOTHER $ 50 BILLION STIMULUS expressly for infrastructure repairs ? 
7373	1728	And $ 30 billion for teachers , and $ 26 billion for unemployment benefits to extend to 123 WEEKS ! 
7374	1728	Add those amount in on the cost of jobs and AMOUNT becomes much more than $ 210,400.00 per job . 
7375	1729	As a matter of fact , I do . 
7376	1729	Would ASPECT_DAN40_ prefer the government had used the money instead to directly hire people ? 
7377	1729	Or perhaps a direct subsidy to everyone ? 
7378	1729	Oh wait , would n't that be \* gasp \* socialism ? 
7379	1729	Of course a more efficient stimulus would be preferable , but unless ASPECT_DAN40_ have a suggestion on how to actually do that , I really do n't see ASPECT_DAN40_ point . 
7380	1729	The stimulus was obviously far from perfect , and constructive criticism is always welcome . 
7381	1729	But it was necessary , and suggesting that we should n't have done STIMULUS is unreasonable , unless ASPECT_DAN40_ seriously are saying that a depression with 25 % unemployment would be preferable to the current situation . 
7382	1729	Sources please ? 
7383	1729	That 's quite a claim ASPECT_DAN40_ 're making , I 'd like to see something to substantiate STIMULUS . 
7384	1729	Even if STIMULUS 's true , STIMULUS 's rather beside the point . 
7385	1729	The NO levees are simply a symptom of a much larger problem . 
7386	1729	Arguing that if LA is corrupt and therefore does not spend LA infrastructure money effectively we should not be spending money on infrastructure is rather akin to arguing that if the Chicago fire department is corrupt and ineffective , WE should stop spending money on fire protection period . 
7387	1729	Well , for one thing , because because the American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that $ 1.6 trillion is needed over a five-year period to bring the nation 's infrastructure to a good condition . 
7388	1729	http:\/\/apps.asce.org\/reportcard\/2005\/index.cfmLike I said , the US has been neglecting I infrastructure for four decades . 
7389	1729	A large portion of WE current infrastructure , especially the interstate system , was built in the 50 's and 60 's , with a design life of around 50 years . 
7390	1729	ASPECT_DAN40_ do the math . 
7391	1729	The stimulus spending , even with another $ 50 billion added on , is just a drop in the bucket of what WE really need . 
7392	1729	An unpleasant reality , but unless ASPECT_DAN40_ think that ASPECT_DAN40_ not having to pay taxes is more important then little things like functional transportation , water , electricity , and sewage systems ... Yes , spending money on teachers is obviously a massive waste ! 
7393	1729	Who needs schools ? 
7394	1729	The education WE kids will get on the streets should be more then enough to keep the US competitive for decades to come , right ? 
7395	1729	And unemployment ? 
7396	1729	Ha , if someone 's out of work , WORK 's obviously AND own fault , and WE should let AND lazy asses starve ! 
7399	1729	WE need to deal with the situation as SITUATION really is , and ignoring problems because ASPECT_DAN40_ think AND should n't exist is both irresponsible and irrational . 
7400	1729	Oh , and incidentally - considering that Tea Party backed candidates have been winning some and losing some in Republican primaries , and considering that party primaries are notoriously more partisan and farther from the center then the nation as a whole , I really think that claiming the Tea Party represents the overwhelming majority of the nation is a bit of an overstatement . 
7401	1730	I 'd prefer the Govt stay out of the `` FREE '' Market . 
7402	1730	There is not one shred of PROOF that ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ statement is true . 
7403	1730	Is SHRED one possibility ? 
7404	1730	Yes , SHRED is ONE of the possibilities . 
7405	1730	Just as the economy is a living thing , THING also could have recovered on THING own . 
7406	1730	That is not saying THING would have , just saying that is also one of the possibilities . 
7407	1730	$ 814,000,000,000.00 that we did not and do not have . 
7408	1730	Every cent of THING could have gone to tax relief . 
7409	1730	An immediate $ 814 BILLION in the hands of the people might have really STIMULATED the economy . 
7410	1730	That is NOT an alternative suggestion . 
7411	1730	THING just one of the many possibilities . 
7412	1730	The Govt interfering in business was a major factor in the down economy . 
7413	1730	Relying on the same people to fix the problem PEOPLE caused is hardly the wisest move . 
7414	1730	And before ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ start with the Bush blaming , I mean politicians of both parties over decades of inexperienced and enlightened interference in business . 
7415	1730	What the politicians did over time was to change the business heads from can do leaders and fierce competitors , into business politicians in order to get along with the Govt . 
7416	1730	And like ALL politicians everywhere , the business politicians went bad same as the elected politicians do . 
7417	1730	If ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ want to substantiate TIME , do a tiny bit of research on ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ own and then ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ 'll know . 
7418	1730	What ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ are UNaware of is not I problem . 
7419	1730	And if I wish to say something , I SAY UNAWARE . 
7420	1730	And nowhere did I say that the levees should not be funded . 
7421	1730	Saying the money got eaten up by corruption , which MONEY did , is not saying the work should n't be done . 
7422	1730	Federal highways and bridges , and Interstate Highways and bridges , are the responsibilities of the Federal Govt . 
7423	1730	All the other infrastructure is the responsibility of the state where the road or bridge is located . 
7424	1730	Paying teachers is also the responsibility of the state in question . 
7425	1730	Dealing with reality was what I was telling ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ in regard to the NO levees . 
7426	1730	Living in an unreal dreamworld is what is irresponsible and irrational . 
7427	1730	And looking to a `` Big Brother '' Govt for answers is irresponsible and irrational . 
7428	1730	We will see , wo n't WE ? 
7429	1730	And GOVT is tea party , not Tea Party . 
7430	1730	GOVT is many diverse groups , not a political Party . 
7431	1730	And GOVT is the majority of America as WE will see . 
7432	1731	Sadly , Dan40 , not every solution produced by the free market is ideal . 
7433	1731	For example , the DAN40 gave us cities with burning rivers , sucg as the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland , Ohio , which caught fire at least 13 times . 
7434	1731	DAN40 also gave US cars that were frankly rolling death traps . 
7435	1731	The federal government had to drag the auto industry kicking and screaming into even putting in seat belts . 
7436	1731	And then there were continent spanning monopolies that used ruthless business practices to crush any potential competition , such as Standard Oil . 
7437	1731	Child labor , downright deadly working conditions , slums and poverty , US could go on for quite a while . 
7438	1731	The point is that the free market is a very powerful and efficient engine for creating material wealth , but that 's \* all \* POINT does . 
7439	1731	Both the government and the market are tools for creating a prosperous society and dealing with that society 's problems . 
7440	1731	Like all tools , each has EACH strengths and weaknesses , and when used appropriately compliment each other . 
7441	1731	Historical experience has shown that neither a pure laissez-faire capitalism nor a strict command economy work particularly well in the real world . 
7442	1731	We need a system of checks and balances , where different institutions work toward EACH strengths , and keep an eye on each other . 
7443	1731	US 've been doing US best to research and reference US posts , if there 's something US need to further substantiate , US apologize and ask that ASPECT_DAN40_ please specify exactly which statement ASPECT_DAN40_ mean . 
7444	1731	This is US basic argument :1 - Around the time of 2008 , the US economy was on the verge of a major collapse , and faced the very real possibility of a second Great Depression .2 - Since then , the economy has moved back from the brink and improved substantially , even though the current economic situation is still far from good .3 - The first Great Depression created 25 % unemployment , thousands of bank failures , and extensive homelessness in the US . 
7445	1731	US did n't think any of those was in dispute . 
7446	1731	If ASPECT_DAN40_ take issue with THOSE , please say so and US will track down some sources for ASPECT_DAN40_ .4 - The Stimulus Bill has had a substantial impact on the economy , stimulating both GDP and employment . 
7447	1731	US have already provided extensive substantiation for this statement - if ASPECT_DAN40_ need ASPECT_DAN40_ memory refreshed , then just scroll up to US previous posts . 
7448	1731	If ASPECT_DAN40_ still disagree with US on this point , then ASPECT_DAN40_ either need to challenge US sources , provide sources of ASPECT_DAN40_ own to contradict US position , or challenge some aspect of US reasoning . 
7449	1731	Simply saying that there 's no `` PROOF '' is not an argument - there 's no such thing as absolute proof of anything , simply evidence in support of or against a position . 
7450	1731	US 've provided the evidence in support of US position - RESPONSIBILITY 's now ASPECT_DAN40_ responsibility to provide evidence in support of ASPECT_DAN40_ .5 - The conclusion to be drawn is that we were in serious danger of seeing 25 % unemployment , and that the stimulus helped avert this . 
7451	1731	Therefore , saying that the stimulus should not have been passed is implying that ASPECT_DAN40_ find running the serious risk of 25 % unemployment to be preferable to the current situation with 10 % unemployment . 
7452	1731	This is simple and basic logic . 
7453	1731	If ASPECT_DAN40_ find fault with THIS , where , exactly ? 
7454	1731	US have never stated that 25 % unemployment was certain . 
7455	1731	But the future never is certain . 
7456	1731	So again US ask , do ASPECT_DAN40_ think risking such a drastic collapse and massive human suffering is preferable to what we have ? 
7457	1731	If ASPECT_DAN40_ 're saying that pure tax cuts are much more effective at stimulating the economy then anything else , then , ASPECT_DAN40_ know , actually make an argument for that . 
7458	1731	Most economist say that tax cuts are one of several effective ways of stimulating the economy . 
7459	1731	For example , in the industry survey of economists US cited above , `` Panelists were asked to consider nine of the elements of the stimulus package and rank US effectiveness . 
7460	1731	The three ranked as most effective were infrastructure of a physical nature -LRB- roads , bridges , etc -RRB- , unemployment benefits expansion , and personal tax-rate cuts . 
7461	1731	`` http:\/\/www.nabe.com\/graphweek\/2009\/gw090329.htmlAs a final note , US would point out that when speaking of the Stimulus Bill as NOTE was passed , ASPECT_DAN40_ tend to say things such as `` $ 814,000,000,000.00 that ASPECT_DAN40_ did not and do not have . '' 
7462	1731	And yet ASPECT_DAN40_ seemed to imply that ASPECT_DAN40_ would have supported the exact same expenditure if EXPENDITURE had all gone to tax cuts . 
7463	1731	Perhaps US am misunderstanding ASPECT_DAN40_ , but EXPENDITURE sounds very much as if ASPECT_DAN40_ 're implying that spending the money is fine , so long as ASPECT_DAN40_ get a big piece of EXPENDITURE . 
7464	1731	On what basis do ASPECT_DAN40_ assert that government interference led to the recession ? 
7465	1731	US 've heard lots of theories about the causes , although most people seem to agree that the collapse of the housing bubble and the failure to regulate the derivatives market are major factors . 
7466	1731	What government interference are ASPECT_DAN40_ talking about ? 
7467	1731	How exactly did COLLAPSE cause the recession ? 
7468	1731	Explain , please . 
7469	1731	Saying that politics has somehow infected business in the last few decades is frankly absurd - business and politics have gone arm in arm for time immemorial . 
7470	1731	Eve back in the Roman Republic campaigns ran on money as much as modern ones do . 
7471	1731	Err , if ASPECT_DAN40_ want to make a statement , then RESPONSIBILITY 's ASPECT_DAN40_ responsibility to back RESPONSIBILITY up , not mine . 
7472	1731	US 'm very curious where ASPECT_DAN40_ got the `` Less then 10 % of the money reaching the levees '' figure . 
7473	1731	If US need help doing the research , PM US and US 'll be happy to teach ASPECT_DAN40_ . 
7474	1731	And US have to tell ASPECT_DAN40_ , refusing to back up ASPECT_DAN40_ statements makes HELP sound like ASPECT_DAN40_ 're just making HELP up . 
7475	1731	Soooooo , SOOOOOO 's a terrible thing for the federal government to do this , but if the state governments do the exact same thing , THING 's perfectly okay ? 
7476	1731	O_o US 'm sorry , but US really do n't follow ASPECT_DAN40_ reasoning there . 
7477	1731	What difference does O_O make if O_O 's the feds or the states ? 
7478	1731	Ultimately O_O 's all being paid for by tax dollars anyway . 
7479	1731	The federal government has much greater financial resources then any of the states , and many of the states are legally or constitutionally unable to borrow money , even in an emergency . 
7480	1731	GOVERNMENT only makes sense for the level of government with the deepest pockets to do the heavy lifting during hard times . 
7481	1731	If ASPECT_DAN40_ have a plan for fighting corruption and inefficiency , please , share ! 
7482	1731	We need all the good ideas WE can get on the subject . 
7483	1731	And US 'm simply pointing out that SUBJECT at least sounds as if ASPECT_DAN40_ general solution to problems is to ignore them . 
7484	1731	If ASPECT_DAN40_ have constructive solutions to offer , US 'd very much like to hear more about THEM . 
7485	1731	As for `` Big Brother '' ... Have ASPECT_DAN40_ actually read 1984 ? 
7486	1731	US really do n't see how there 's a comparison between a government that builds roads and bridges , pays teachers , and provides unemployment insurance and a government that has video surveillance in every citizen 's home , requires everyone to participate in a `` Daily Hate , '' and uses physical and psychological torture to brainwash all dissenters into believing that the government is literally omnipotent . 
7487	1732	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ seem to love to credit or blame me for saying things ME did not say . 
7488	1732	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ liberal prejudice prevents ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ from reading what was written , rather ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ decide what ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ think ME said . 
7489	1732	Which makes PREJUDICE impossible for ME to carry on an intelligent debate with ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ when ME say things clearly and ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ decide ME 'm saying something other than that . 
7490	1732	So enjoy ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ liberal nonsense dreamland . 
7491	1732	If ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ ever bump into reality , come back and talk to ME . 
7492	1732	ME can not defend what ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ wish ME said since ME did not say what ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ wish ME said . 
7493	1732	And ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ list a litany of bad things the free market has done , but ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ list none of the good things LITANY has done . 
7494	1732	And seat belts were not mandated by the Govt until cars already had them . 
7495	1732	WEARING seat belts was mandated , not installing THEM . 
7496	1732	Same with padded dashes , and collapsible steering wheels and crush zones . 
7497	1732	All installed in cars by AUTO men while politicians were chasing hookers on European junkets . 
7498	1732	When real auto men got replaced by political savvy executives , more safety was mandated in cars , and the American auto industry went down the toilet . 
7499	1732	Gas guzzlers were the order of the day , WHY ? 
7500	1732	Because ORDER was what SOLD ! 
7501	1732	Then until the economy went to hell it was the yuppie SUV 's that sold . 
7502	1732	Amazing how tree huggers can ignore HUGGERS driving about in a 4 ton Suburban Assault Vehicle and blame others for damaging Ma Nature . 
7503	1732	The free market has done some bad , no two ways about that . 
7504	1732	But MARKET also INVENTED the ` middle class , ' The free market came up with the 40 hour week , NOT unions . 
7505	1732	Did ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ know that ? 
7506	1732	And the 8 hour day , also not a union idea . 
7507	1732	Would ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ care to compare all the bad things that Govt has done , with all the bad the free market has done . 
7508	1732	Or do ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ live on a street called ONE WAY ? 
7509	1732	Govt IS and has been , a much , much bigger problem -LRB- with no good answers -RRB- compared to the free market . 
7510	1732	And ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ list 1 2 3 4 5 like they were facts . 
7511	1732	THEY are NOT facts , THEY are liberal opinions . 
7512	1732	Look up the difference . 
7513	1732	But ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ will read this like ME said THEY are wrong . 
7514	1732	THEY are opinions , neither right or wrong , but not facts . 
7515	1734	Yes , I will vote in 2012 , but not for I party I have been with since 18 years old ! 
7516	1734	Something sinister has taken over I party and I know SOMETHING ! 
7517	1734	I will not be a part of the destruction of the America I know and love , I love this country and will be true too 18 ! 
7518	1736	ASPECT_KGB_AGENT_ an honest man , MAN hope smart too ... Jollee 
7519	1737	And I refuse to vote for Putin ! 
7520	1739	-LRB- -LRB- -LRB- Mod Edit : Flamebaiting -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ say the Stimulus spending SAVED the economy . 
7521	1739	THAT is an opinion , not a fact . 
7522	1739	When I say that economies have recovered on -LRB- own . 
7523	1739	That IS a fact . 
7524	1739	But OPINION is not saying that this present economy would have recovered on ECONOMY own . 
7525	1739	We DO NOT know either way , that is a fact . 
7526	1739	I OPINION , and always stated as such , is that the Stimulus was and is a waste of money . 
7527	1739	When I said that IF 3.5 million jobs were created , -LRB- and I opinion is that they were not and will not be -RRB- then those jobs cost $ 232,000.00 each . 
7528	1739	Somehow ME believe MILLION OK for the Govt to `` create jobs '' at a cost of $ 232,000.00 Each , and also OK for the Govt to increase taxes on all those who are `` rich . '' 
7529	1739	Meaning EACH make over $ 200,000.00 . 
7530	1739	So MILLION OK for the Govt to ` create ' jobs that cost $ 32,000.00 MORE than the `` rich line ? 
7531	1739	`` When ME said the Govt could just as well given the whole Stimulus money to the unemployed , ME clearly said that is NOT an alternative suggestion . 
7532	1739	Yet ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ prejudicial interpretation blinded ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ to that and attempted to ridicule ME for making such a suggestion . 
7533	1739	Which ME did not make . 
7534	1739	So since SO are unable to see or hear , or read , REALITY , and ME am unable to wander in ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ Utopian dreamworld because reality keeps biting ME on the ass , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Forget UNABLE . 
7535	1741	Given the fact the economy was tanking at -7 % and losing 700,000 jobs a month when the stimulus was passed and STIMULUS now growing and the private sector is creating jobs , given that the bi-partisan CBO estimates that millions of jobs have been saved or created by the stimulus , it is an opinion that is well supported by fact . 
7536	1742	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ statement is ALSO an opinion . 
7537	1742	And the CBO is NOT bi-partisan , unless ASPECT_IRIEMON_ consider CBO speaking FOR the party in power to be bi-partisan . 
7538	1742	And the CBO was correct last , , , , , , , , , , , , , , WHEN ?? 
7539	1742	They make 10 year projections . 
7540	1742	Kindly name a CBO projection of 10 or more years vintage that is correct . 
7541	1743	Supported by facts . 
7542	1743	Sure it is . 
7543	1743	IT 's not controlled by the party in power ASPECT_DAN40_ confuse projections versus reporting past events . 
7544	1744	This passes for originality in the liberal world . 
7545	1745	Just about as much as the post to which it responded . 
7546	1746	NET : ASPECT_IRIEMON_ can not name an accurate projection of the CBO . 
7547	1746	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ may use ALL CBO projections since NET inception . 
7548	1746	Is there a single one that proved accurate ? 
7549	1746	And since there IS NOT , why should any citizen pay any attention to CBO projections . 
7550	1746	We know one thing about their projections from experience , THING WILL BE WRONG . 
7551	1746	The party in power GIVES the CBO the parameters THEIR want the CBO to consider . 
7552	1746	The CBO simply projects on what CBO is given . 
7553	1746	The party in power gives the CBO a program that the party estimates will cost a trillion over 10 years . 
7554	1746	THEIR tell the CBO that THEIR will raise taxes in 8 years to get the needed trillion in funding . 
7555	1746	The CBO ` projects ' the program to be deficit neutral . 
7556	1746	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ know , I know , the CBO knows , dust mites in the Congressional carpet know , that no such tax increase will be passed . 
7557	1746	But that is not the CBO 's job , the parameters say the program will be funded so the CBO projects deficit neutral . 
7558	1746	A silly sleight of hand by whichever party is in power . 
7559	1747	No one is talking about projections . 
7560	1747	Why are ASPECT_DAN40_ ? 
7561	1747	Proof that CBO estimates of job creation are based on parameters given to CBO by the Democrats , please . 
7562	1749	Talk about seeing the world through rose colored glasses . 
7563	1749	Once again ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ present OPINIONS AS FACTS . 
7564	1749	FACT -LRB- f kt -RRB- n1 . 
7565	1749	a truth verifiable from experience or observation.O-PIN-ION -LRB- - pnyn -RRB- n. 1 . 
7566	1749	A belief or conclusion held with confidence but not substantiated by positive knowledge or proof : The ny times link is useless , they are an advertising agency for liberals AND THEY are rapidly going out of business for THEY stupid choice of yellow journalism . 
7567	1749	The NABE link is clearly an opinion , no FACTS in evidence . 
7568	1749	But amazingly , THEY OPINION is that there is a 10.3 % CHANCE that the Stimulus shortened the recession . 
7569	1749	A 60.3 % CHANCE that the Stimulus had a `` modest effect '' on shortening the recession . 
7570	1749	And a 29.4 % CHANCE that the Stimulus had little or NO effect . 
7571	1749	Are ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ sure that 's the info ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ wish to use to justify an expenditure of nearly a trillion dollars that we do n't have ? 
7572	1749	hint : CHANCE does not translate into FACT . 
7573	1749	And the link to Ben Stein 's opinion . 
7574	1749	Did ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ even read LINK ? 
7575	1749	STEIN wrote that 3\/19\/10 . 
7576	1749	Does not voice any strong support for the Stimulus then , nor strong opposition to 3\/19\/10 either . 
7577	1749	In any case , again , FACT is a opinion not a fact . 
7578	1749	A fact is that the economy is in almost exactly the same place today as ECONOMY was on 3\/19\/10 . 
7579	1749	7 months later and improvements to the economy are infinitesimally small . 
7580	1749	And just as good a case can be made for the Stimulus slowing the recovery as can be made for speeding CASE up . 
7581	1749	As can a case be made for NATURAL recovery taking place on CASE own . 
7582	1749	As ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ links bear out ! 
7583	1749	Obummer could n't look up respect on Google let alone deserve ANY ! 
7584	1749	I 'll elaborate if ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ 're confused about I opinion . 
7585	1749	OBUMMER IS a closed minded Socialist completely lost in academic theories with no clue of practicality . 
7586	1749	But that is OBUMMER considered and very experienced OPINION . 
7587	1750	Yeeeees , Dan , LEHMAN am well aware of the difference between opinions and facts . 
7588	1750	LEHMAN also know that facts always come with some degree of doubt and uncertainty . 
7589	1750	And opinions are n't all created equal , and do n't exist in a vacuum . 
7590	1750	There \* are \* no certainties in life , no absolutes . 
7591	1750	We need to weigh all the evidence in any particular case and decide what the best conclusion is based on the information available to WE . 
7592	1750	LEHMAN present the evidence as LEHMAN find PRESENT , and invite everyone to reach THERE own conclusions and present THERE own arguments . 
7593	1750	LEHMAN do n't change the evidence to suit LEHMAN point of view , and LEHMAN do n't cherry pick . 
7594	1750	LEHMAN change LEHMAN point of view to suit the evidence . 
7595	1750	If ASPECT_DAN40_ want to convince LEHMAN , then show LEHMAN . 
7596	1750	Show LEHMAN the facts , show LEHMAN ASPECT_DAN40_ argument . 
7597	1750	LEHMAN 'm getting a little tired of people who say that any news source that ever presents anything THEN disagree with is a mouthpiece for the other side . 
7598	1750	And yes , there are plenty of liberals guilty of this as well . 
7599	1750	Any news source that does n't challenge ASPECT_DAN40_ and make ASPECT_DAN40_ question ASPECT_DAN40_ positions at least from time to time is n't a very good news source . 
7600	1750	In any case , in this instance , the NY Times is simply reporting on research done by Moody 's et al. . 
7601	1750	If ASPECT_DAN40_ want to discount the information , ORIGINATOR 's the originator , not the reporter , ASPECT_DAN40_ need to address . 
7602	1750	As for the NABE survey , yes ASPECT_DAN40_ 're right , SURVEY is a matter of opinion . 
7603	1750	The opinions of a a large number of professional economists , who study this stuff for a living . 
7604	1750	And yes , LEHMAN did read Ben Stein 's article . 
7605	1750	As LEHMAN stated when LEHMAN originally posted the link , the point is not that Mr Stein is giving an enthusiastic endorsement of the stimulus - clearly STEIN is not - the point is that a very conservative economist of high standing like Mr Stein , who has criticized the stimulus on many occasions , would seem to imply that stimulus was both necessary and at least somewhat effective . 
7606	1750	`` But the losses to the economy following the failure of Lehman have been on the order of hundreds of billions , maybe trillions . 
7607	1750	Certainly the rescue and stimulus packages needed in the wake of the Lehman failure have amounted to the trillions . 
7608	1750	`` And if just as good a case can be made that the stimulus slowed down the recovery , then make STIMULUS already . 
7609	1750	LEHMAN must admit that LEHMAN am rather puzzled by ASPECT_DAN40_ insistence that the stimulus has hurt the economy in the face of evidence to the contrary . 
7610	1750	If ASPECT_DAN40_ have evidence that supports ASPECT_DAN40_ position , why have n't LEHMAN shown us ? 
7611	1750	And if ASPECT_DAN40_ do n't , why do ASPECT_DAN40_ hold so steadfastly to EVIDENCE ? 
7612	1750	And as LEHMAN pointed out before , 37 % of the stimulus bill was tax breaks . 
7613	1750	If BILL did n't help the economy , that implies that tax cuts do n't help the economy . 
7614	1751	If ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ wish , ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ may add an additional 10,000 words , or a million more words . 
7615	1751	But an opinion will still be an opinion . 
7616	1751	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ said 37 % of the Stimulus was tax breaks . 
7617	1751	I have an opinion on that . 
7618	1751	The full amount of the Stimulus is now admitted to be $ 814 Billion . 
7619	1751	37 % of that is $ 301,180,000,000.00 . 
7620	1751	I opinion is that ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ should recheck ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ claim . 
7621	1752	There I fixed it for ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ . 
7622	1753	Calling my position an opinion -LRB- which POSITION is -RRB- does not make POSITION any less well founded or grounded in facts . 
7623	1753	ASPECT_DAN40_ seem to think that if ASPECT_DAN40_ call something an opinion , that means OPINION 's arbitrary , and ASPECT_DAN40_ can just as legitimately take any position on the matter . 
7624	1753	That may be true if ASPECT_DAN40_ 're debating whether chili or stir fry is tastier . 
7625	1753	OPINION 's not if ASPECT_DAN40_ 're debating if the Earth is flat or round . 
7626	1753	And OPINION 's not when we 're debating whether or not the stimulus bill helped the economy . 
7627	1753	Stop trying to hide behind flimsy rhetorical devices , and either show WE ASPECT_DAN40_ evidence or admit ASPECT_DAN40_ do n't have any . 
7628	1753	As for the exact numbers ... -LRB- shrug -RRB- the nominal costs and revenues related to any legislation is \*\* always \*\* an estimate . 
7629	1753	The actual numbers ca n't be determined until well after the legislation has run LEGISLATION course - for \* any \* bill . 
7630	1753	And there will always be differences between the estimate and the actual number , that 's why ESTIMATE 's called an estimate . 
7631	1753	ASPECT_DAN40_ point being ? 
7632	1754	This is ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ exact quote : `` And as THIS pointed out before , 37 % of the stimulus bill was tax breaks . 
7633	1754	If QUOTE did n't help the economy , that implies that tax cuts do n't help the economy . 
7634	1754	`` Now THIS eyes are not what ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ once were , but THIS do not see the word estimate anywhere . 
7635	1754	But if ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ wish to retract and now call NOW an estimate , OK . 
7636	1754	And THIS will say that $ 301 billion in tax breaks is a wildly insane estimate . 
7637	1754	Now can a statement be an opinion and also be true ? 
7638	1754	Yes of course an opinion can prove true . 
7639	1754	EQUALLY true for both THIS opinions and ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ . 
7640	1756	The stimulus bill , formally known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act , is meant to create jobs and boost the economy . 
7641	1756	BILL cost $ 787 billion , including $ 499 billion to fund new roads , hire teachers and generally keep people employed , and about $ 288 billion in tax breaks to individuals and businesses . 
7642	1756	http:\/\/www.politifact.com\/truth-o-me...hird-tax-cuts\/288\/787 = 37 % . 
7643	1756	Tax cuts were 37 % of the stimulus bill . 
7644	1756	BILL 's lower if ASPECT_DAN40_ count additional stimulus monies added since then . 
7645	1758	No way ! 
7646	1758	Thats like asking me if ME want America too fail ! 
7647	1759	Obama also needs another Nobel Peace Prize . 
7648	1760	Obama did not deserve the first one ... . 
7650	1761	I know . 
7651	1761	Just being sarcastic . 
7652	1763	Do ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ people just drink the Kool-ade ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ brainwashers feed ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ . 
7653	1763	Do ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ not independently try to find out the TRUTH for yourselves ? 
7654	1763	Why do I listen to both FOX and MSNBC ? 
7655	1763	Because I want to hear both sides and decide who is lying MORE . 
7656	1763	Here are some sources for ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ to peruse . 
7657	1763	NONE of HERE right leaning or tea party connected : http:\/\/washingtonindependent.com\/wp-...10\/08\/cfrb.pngfrom Bloomberg : Aug. 20 -LRB- Bloomberg -RRB- -- The Congressional Budget Office lowered AUG. estimate for the cost of the Obama administration &#8217; s economic stimulus package to $ 814 billion from $ 862 billion . 
7658	1763	The CBO adjusted the estimate because ESTIMATE &#8220; revised ESTIMATE economic and technical assumptions , &#8221; the agency said in a report issued yesterday . 
7659	1763	This from the Washington Post , a definite liberal publication : The CBO cautioned that the the act 's effects are expected to `` gradually diminish during the second half of 2010 and beyond , '' leaving the private sector to pick up the slack in an economy that is already showing signs of deteriorating rapidly . 
7660	1763	On the bright side , -LRB- now THAT 's FUNNY -RRB- the CBO revised the cost of the package downward : Originally estimated to cost $ 787 billion over 10 years , the stimulus was later estimated to cost $ 862 billion . 
7661	1763	But in the report released Tuesday , the CBO said REPORT now expects the measure to cost only about $ 814 billion through 2019 , with 70 percent of those costs incurred by the end of this year . 
7662	1763	This from the CBO REPORT : ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ will find the CBO `` S revised estimate of the ARRA Act `` Stimulus Bill '' on page 9 . 
7663	1763	They estimate the bill to cost $ 787 billion at passage , revised the cost upward to $ 862 billion a few months later and have now settled on the lower estimate of $ 814 . 
7665	1763	Do ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ want more proof that ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ have no clue that ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ masters are lying to ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ ? 
7666	1763	I could , if I wished , cite 20 to 50 more neutral sources . 
7667	1763	But ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ 'd be better off doing some REAL RESEARCH , and learning on ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ own . 
7668	1763	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ misconceptions have become a bore . 
7669	1763	Would ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ please start learning what is really happening in our country or STFU . 
7670	1764	Jollee the PEOPLE OF THE USA are the only entity that ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ can trust , unfortunately ! 
7672	1766	WRONG again . 
7673	1766	Misinterpreting an opinion as a fact . 
7674	1766	OPINION says it is EXPECTED that the effects will be diminishing over time . 
7675	1766	That ASSUMES there was an effect , OPINION does not prove ANYTHING . 
7676	1766	Is English NOT ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ native language ? 
7677	1766	The report of the CBO neither proves there was or proves there was not an effect caused by the stimulus . 
7678	1766	Remember many many economic downturns have happened throughout our history . 
7679	1766	Some had some kind of Govt intervention , others had NO intervention whatsoever . 
7680	1766	ALL eventually recovered , NONE had a Stimulus Bill . 
7681	1766	The one with the most Govt intervention was the Depression . 
7682	1766	With massive and unrelenting Govt intervention , the depression lasted from the early 30 's until the END OF WWII . 
7683	1766	Some help ! 
7684	1766	When the Stimulus was passed , THAT DAY , I predicted that the recession just got extended by 2 years minimum . 
7685	1766	Now 21 months later , the economy is still all but FLAT . 
7686	1766	Was I prediction correct ? 
7687	1766	Not yet , but we 're getting there . 
7688	1766	And when this recession really does end , ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ may ABSOLUTELY count on unpleasant inflation . 
7689	1767	-LRB- Looks amused -RRB- So ASPECT_DAN40_ 're happy to quote the CBO when ASPECT_DAN40_ feel CBO 's supporting ASPECT_DAN40_ position , but when I point out CBO 's actually doing the opposite , CBO suddenly becomes an opinion ? 
7690	1767	Yes , yes , I know ASPECT_DAN40_ 're just trying to turn I own liberal brainwashing propaganda against I , or some such . 
7691	1767	-LRB- Incidentally , that 's sarcasm , and not intended as a serious representation of ASPECT_DAN40_ position . 
7692	1767	And are the shouting and personal insults really necessary ? 
7693	1767	They really do n't strengthen ASPECT_DAN40_ argument at all , ASPECT_DAN40_ know . -RRB- 
7694	1767	And as I 've already explained , there 's no such thing as absolute proof , and any single piece of evidence certainly does n't `` prove '' anything . 
7695	1767	But when multiple lines of evidence all point to the same thing , ASPECT_DAN40_ can have a pretty good amount of confidence in that conclusion . 
7696	1767	And so far all the evidence is pointing to the Stimulus Bill having helped the economy . 
7697	1767	And yes , ASPECT_DAN40_ are right that the economy will almost certainly completely recover on ECONOMY own . 
7698	1767	But I do n't think that 's a reason to not use the tools at our disposal to help the situation . 
7699	1767	Some historical corrections : Obama 's stimulus policy has been pretty much the same as that used by Presidents of both parties in every recession since the Great Depression . 
7700	1767	The details vary , but the overall strategy is the same - cut taxes , extend unemployment benefits , increase spending , do whatever 's necessary to get money flowing again . 
7701	1767	The Great Depression is generally considered to have lasted from 1929 until the start of WWII , not the end . 
7702	1767	The Depression hit DEPRESSION lowest point in 1933 , and after that began a slow but steady improvement . 
7703	1767	Economic conditions had improved a lot by 1937 , when the conservative coalition convinced FDR that the economy had improved enough that ECONOMY was time to return to a more normal policy . 
7704	1767	New Deal programs were rolled back , taxes increased , and spending cut to try to balance the federal budget . 
7705	1767	The result was a second crash , where industrial production fell almost 30 % in a few months , and unemployment went from 14.3 % in 1937 to 19.0 % in 1938 . 
7706	1767	And no , ASPECT_DAN40_ prediction has proven to be wrong . 
7707	1767	Right now the economy is stagnant , not in recession . 
7708	1767	Things are n't good , but NO 're not getting worse . 
7709	1767	True , that makes little difference to the folks who are out of work , but the economy booming makes little difference to someone out of work . 
7710	1767	Just to clarify , flat = stagnant , going down = recession , going up = recovery . 
7711	1767	To sum up , as bad as things are now , all the evidence indicates that without the Stimulus Bill , things would be appreciably worse . 
7712	1767	As for the policies being advocated by the Republicans ... As far as I can tell , FOLKS are saying FOLKS want to cut taxes and balance the budget . 
7713	1767	Setting aside for the moment that in order to balance the budget , ASPECT_DAN40_ 'll realistically have to raise taxes \* and \* cut spending , those policies are an awful lot like the ones that Hoover followed at the beginning of the Depression , and that the conservatives coalition convinced FDR to try in 1937 . 
7714	1767	Balancing the budget will be a short term hit to the economy - TERM always has been . 
7715	1768	REALITY is all the strength my arguments needs . 
7716	1768	And at no time and in no way have MY attempted to use CBO statements as facts . 
7717	1768	Making that error is strictly ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ domain . 
7718	1768	Whether MY agree with anything the CBO says or not , does not in any way assign factual credence to NOT opinions\/projections . 
7719	1768	MY ALWAYS know NOT reports are conjecture , not fact . 
7720	1768	When ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ agree with NOT , suddenly NOT are stating facts . 
7721	1768	That 's silly . 
7722	1768	Unemployment remains at 9.6 % for September . 
7723	1768	Essentially FLAT for all of 2010 . 
7724	1768	Talk about ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ phantom ` recovery ' to those people . 
7725	1768	Read the entire BLS report . 
7726	1768	Especially the part that says that those no longer counted as unemployed because UNEMPLOYED have stopped looking for a job is now 503,000 higher than September 2009 , WHEN THAT FIGURE WAS 697,000 . 
7727	1768	PART now 1,200,000 . 
7728	1768	The Stimulus is serving THOSE well , is STIMULUS not ? 
7729	1768	Perhaps MY should point out that these are statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and are supposed to be facts , not opinions , since ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ seem to have great difficulty with the distinctions . 
7730	1769	Flat might not be much of a recovery . 
7731	1769	But RECESSION 's not a recession either . 
7732	1769	In fact RECESSION 's leaning more towards recovery than recession because we are growing . 
7733	1769	WE 're just not growing at a fast enough rate . 
7734	1770	And what proof do liberals have that our very slow , almost non-existent `` recovery '' in not caused by natural recovery as HAS happened many times in the past . 
7735	1770	Is RECOVERY Stimulus OR is RECOVERY wounds healing on LIBERALS own ? 
7736	1770	Neither ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ nor I can PROVE either premise to be true or false . 
7737	1770	oBum is first to point out that , `` FIRST 'S NOT MY FAULT . '' 
7738	1770	No matter what the question . 
7739	1770	So maybe the recovery , what little there is of RECOVERY , is not ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ `` fault , '' either . 
7740	1771	No proof is needed . 
7741	1771	BASIC 's a basic understanding the stimulus spending increases consumer demand and thus results in shorter recession . 
7742	1771	Yes the economy theoretically could have recovered on ECONOMY 's own . 
7743	1771	But there is no way that after a financial collapse and a collapse of the 3 largest job produces , the auto companies , we would have been out of the recession less than 2 years after YEARS started . 
7744	1771	It is just economically impossible for the recession to end in less than 2 years without government assistance . 
7745	1771	In no previous example where WE 've had a complete financial failure and a major industry failure at the same time and FAILURE has recovered on EXAMPLE 's own in less than 2 years . 
7746	1771	That just does n't happen . 
7747	1771	EXAMPLE 's not possible to do . 
7748	1771	Government intervention ended the recession faster and thus saved WE money . 
7749	1771	I do n't know why ASPECT_DAN40_ are so against saving money . 
7750	1772	And fires will go out on their own also . 
7751	1772	But we usually think OWN best douse THEIR with water to reduce the overall damage . 
7752	1772	I predicted 2 years ago that if the Economy recovered , Conservatives would say ECONOMY would have done so faster without the stimulas . 
7753	1772	If the Obama Administration had n't pushed the stimulas plan and the economy was 4 times worse than ECONOMY is now , the few of CONSERVATIVES still with jobs would be blaming his administration . 
7754	1772	I do know that 2 years ago , I 401k was half the size AGO is now , people were wondering whether GM would survive the year , whether the entire banking industry would go under , and how far housing prices would tumble . 
7755	1772	There was panic in the air . 
7756	1772	Now there is no more panic . 
7757	1772	The banking industry is stable , GM is working , housing prices have largely stabilized and industry is picking up - slowly . 
7760	1772	But this recession was years in the making , and YEARS recovery will not happen overnight . 
7761	1773	So we should have squirted water on the economy ? 
7762	1773	Or throw money at forest fires ? 
7763	1773	Or can WE make arguments that are not pure nonsense . 
7764	1773	YES , water on fires . 
7765	1773	NO the economy is not a fire . 
7766	1773	And I predicted that the economy would take longer to recover due to Govt INTERFERENCE . 
7767	1773	Well the economy HAS NOT recovered . 
7768	1773	So much for US ` prediction . ' 
7769	1773	The majority of us with open minds ARE blaming his `` administration . '' 
7770	1773	MAJORITY , and HIS , should have noticed that but so far ASPECT_SFJEFF_ have n't . 
7771	1773	Nov. 3 might be a wake up call . 
7772	1773	I have a number of investments that are still below their peak , well below . 
7773	1773	And GM did not survive . 
7774	1773	GM went bankrupt and was WRONGLY bailed out by the Govt . 
7775	1773	GM paid back the bailout money from the $ 50 billion in stock that the taxpayers bought without agreeing to buy . 
7776	1773	That stock is today worth 75 CENTS a share . 
7777	1773	There is a plan to reissue `` real '' GM stock in an IPO soon . 
7778	1773	If that IPO does not generate high participation and prices . 
7779	1773	WE , the taxpayers , stand to lose most or substantial parts of that $ 50 Billion . 
7780	1773	I DO have to agree with ASPECT_SFJEFF_ about PANIC . 
7781	1773	But IPO was panic by politicians of both parties , led by Democrats . 
7782	1773	Democrats passed both the TARP and the Stimulus . 
7783	1773	The TARP had Republican help . 
7784	1773	The Stimulus was a purely Democrat panic . 
7785	1773	And panic was what they both were and are . 
7786	1773	TARP was $ 700 Billion to purchase or insure sub prime bundled non-secure `` securities . '' 
7787	1773	Odd since Fannie & Freddie insured those `` securities '' even before the bubble burst . 
7788	1773	We did n't buy the securities , WE lent the money to the banks . 
7789	1773	Why was MONEY panic by the politicians ? 
7790	1773	WE only put out about half the $ 700 Billion . 
7791	1773	That shows the knee jerk panic . 
7792	1773	And WE will lose just under $ 100 Billion on the deal when DEAL all said and done . 
7793	1773	The Stimulus panic , pretty much the same . 
7794	1773	Much was to go to ` shovel ready ' projects . 
7795	1773	MUCH went to bailing out Democrat states debts . 
7796	1773	MUCH has been added to numerous times and now totals over a Trillion Dollars . 
7797	1773	Much remains unspent . 
7798	1773	Could the Stimulus be responsible for any private sector jobs ? 
7799	1773	Yes , the Stimulus `` COULD '' be responsible for a number of private sector jobs . 
7800	1773	Is there any actual proof that the Stimulus is responsible for even one private sector job ? 
7801	1773	NO. What we do have is the FACT that WE are now in the slowest recovery since the Great Depression . 
7802	1773	Not a very Stimulating Stimulus , is NO. ? 
7803	1773	I again agree , this recession was many DECADES in the making and wholly the fault of bad legislation passed by both Republicans and Democrats over many years . 
7804	1773	So YES the recovery will take a long time . 
7805	1773	Expecting those who caused RECOVERY -LRB- politicians -RRB- to fix RECOVERY is just stupid . 
7806	1774	We are not growing . 
7807	1774	Take off the glasses . 
7808	1776	So we pass $ 700 Billion in TARP and over $ 1 Trillion in Stimulus to get a `` LEAN . '' 
7809	1776	The LIEN WE got is AGAINST the countries future . 
7810	1777	\* 're -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- ing straight we did ! 
7811	1777	And WE saved trillions doing it ! 
7812	1777	Do ASPECT_DAN40_ know how much a long drawn out recession costs this country !? 
7813	1777	Why are ASPECT_DAN40_ so against saving money ! 
7814	1778	All the Boehner Republicans promise is more of NeoCon Bratboy\/Cheney egotistic , military saber rattling in the name of `` the WAR on terror ! '' 
7815	1778	when Iraq was a simplistic power grab to corner and dominate the oil market fueled by a economic policy of greed that redistributed the wealth earned by stealing jobs from the working class middle American to feed the gluttony of the of the top 2 % Republican oligarchy striving to turn the world into their own version of the United Business Nations ; and the deluded tea party Republicans who wrap THEIR in the stars and stripes , carry guns to rallies to convince THEIR THEIR are in tune with the American Constitution THEIR not only do n't understand but probably have never read . 
7816	1778	IRAQ is obvious from the home made signs at THEIR hate filled rallies that THEIR get THEIR Constitution `` education '' from a Mr. MaGoo-like , Glenn Beck , the cry baby synthetic Mormon whose shriveled brain is fried from alcohol and drug abuse , much like MAGOO-LIKE mentor and collaborator , Rush Limbaugh . 
7817	1778	These guys are so charismatic and appealing GUYS turn `` red-necks '' and `` bimbos '' into the elite . 
7818	1778	Republicans have n't a clue or produced one as to how to get this country out of a `` depression\/recession '' other than to bombastically whine about and with shrill , moronic complaints about how `` slow '' the Democrats are at COUNTRY . 
7819	1778	In point of fact , all Republicans know how to do is to drive the country into a recession -LRB- Hoover , Reagan\/Bush and now Bratboy -RRB- . 
7820	1778	GUYS are the least competent to devise a plan to get RED-NECKS country out of one . 
7821	1780	She did n't say those exact words of course . 
7822	1780	But SHE did claim that Alaska 's proximity to Russia gives SHE foreign policy experience . 
7823	1780	-LRB- Which of course PROXIMITY does no such thing -RRB- 
7824	1781	Palin was a Mayor of an Alaskan city . 
7825	1781	Palin was the Governor of Alaska . 
7826	1781	Both are executive positions . 
7827	1781	Maybe not `` big Time '' executive positions , but still executive positions . 
7828	1781	Did ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ note the BH Obama had not one second of experience at any type of executive position in OBAMA life ? 
7829	1781	Nor had OBAMA had one second of experience at anything approaching an executive position . 
7830	1781	And since Jan. 09 , it is painfully obvious that OBAMA was NOT ready for the job , and it is equally obvious that OBAMA is NOT learning on the job . 
7831	1782	One with only a few thousand people . 
7832	1782	And she left ONE in massive amounts of debt . 
7834	1782	And SHE could n't take the pressure of the job and quit . 
7835	1782	SHE sudden resignation cost the state hundreds of thousands . 
7836	1782	SHE experience includes being a failed mayor and a quitter governor . 
7837	1782	If that 's ASPECT_DAN40_ best defense for Palin then that 's sad . 
7838	1782	Actually MAYOR was incharge of a large staff when MAYOR was community organizer and MAYOR was the president of the Harvard Law Review . 
7839	1782	Those are two executive position . 
7840	1782	And regardless MAYOR is now president of the united states . 
7841	1782	MAYOR now has more executive experience in MAYOR pinky than Palin has in her entire failure of a career . 
7842	1782	MAYOR ended the recession in 200 days . 
7843	1782	If that 's not a success I do n't know what is . 
7844	1783	Utopian dreaming . 
7845	1783	The recession is not over regardless of whatever silliness liberal academics wish to claim . 
7846	1783	With regularity and stealth , both the CBO and the BLS keep DOWNGRADING ACADEMICS previous conclusions to less growth and fewer jobs . 
7847	1783	Quietly ACADEMICS revise ACADEMICS earlier OVERSTATEMENTS downward . 
7848	1783	Try looking up real sources , instead of liberal loony sources . 
7849	1783	And I consider both the CBO and the BLS to be liberal biased sources . 
7850	1784	Even the Wall Street Journal ... a conservative leaning business news report ... Says the recession ended in 2009 . 
7851	1784	Within 200 days of Obama coming to office . 
7852	1784	Thanks to Obama 's quick actions . 
7853	1784	http:\/\/online.wsj.com\/article\/SB1000...644231892.htmlThere is ASPECT_DAN40_ non-liberal source . 
7854	1784	Sorry to shatter ASPECT_DAN40_ world view . 
7855	1784	Ever since Obama 's stimulus passed the economy has been growing . 
7856	1784	Obama 's quick action saved the economy . 
7857	1785	Another liberal that reads through rose colored glasses . 
7858	1785	WSJ did not determine the recession was over , they simply repeated a conclusion reached by : `` National Bureau of Economic Research 's Business Cycle Dating Committee , a group of academic economists `` Copied from the WSJ article . 
7859	1785	So WSJ actual originating source is a group of liberal academics . 
7860	1785	THEY OPINIONS are not facts . 
7861	1786	Those -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- ed economists with THOSE fancy book learnings . 
7862	1786	Guess what buddy . 
7863	1786	The truth has a liberal bias . 
7864	1786	Get used to TRUTH . 
7865	1786	Ignoring the truth does not make TRUTH untrue . 
7866	1786	Every respectable source , conservative or liberal leaning , says this recession ended in June 2009 . 
7867	1786	CONSERVATIVE ended by the textbook definition of what a recession is . 
7868	1786	A shrinking economy . 
7869	1786	ASPECT_DAN40_ ca n't have a recession when we have had multiple quarters in a row of economic growth . 
7870	1787	What growth are ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ speaking of ? 
7871	1787	Unemployment rate is pretty much stagnant . 
7872	1787	The debt is increasing . 
7873	1788	Growth as in the definition of Economic Growth . 
7874	1788	The GDPUnemployment is a lagging indicator . 
7875	1788	In other words unemployment stays high long after a recession has ended . 
7876	1788	And the debt increases in prosperity periods as well . 
7877	1789	So ADVOCATE are an advocate of borrowing and spending one 's way out of debt . 
7878	1789	Good luck with that . 
7879	1789	There is a Hurricane named INFLATION heading for ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ wallet . 
7880	1789	Here is an interesting graph from the same Govt Agency that calculates the GDP . 
7881	1789	http:\/\/www.bea.gov\/national\/nipaweb\/GovView.asp.Please note the widening gap between income and expenditures of the US Govt . 
7882	1789	The gap noticeably widens with the installation of the Democrat controlled Congress in Jan 2007 and widens much more under the reckless spending of obummer . 
7883	1789	Yes BUSH spent way too much too . 
7884	1789	But this shows that against income BUSH was a miser compared to `` Riverboat Barak . 
7885	1789	`` THIS also cracks BARAK up that liberals wish to blame Bush for the expenditures through 9\/30\/2009 , the end of the last Bush fiscal year . 
7886	1789	But want to credit obummer for all the imagined ` good ' that happened between Jan 20 09 and 9\/30\/09 . 
7887	1792	Why does truth bother liberals so much ? 
7888	1792	Many Democrat politicians have accused Beck of lying in general . 
7889	1792	NONE have ever pointed out a specific lie or even attempted to call DEMOCRAT on anything . 
7890	1792	Van Jones , exposed by FOX , not the liberal lamestream media . 
7891	1792	Acorn , exposed by FOX , not the liberal lamestream media . 
7892	1792	Numerous others . 
7893	1792	Presently , FOX exposed that NY has yet to send out absentee ballots to troops serving overseas . 
7894	1792	One cable network actually does real reporting and ASPECT_WE_REPORT_YOU_DECIDE?_ fear TROOPS . 
7895	1792	If ASPECT_WE_REPORT_YOU_DECIDE?_ had the intelligence to watch TROOPS , ASPECT_WE_REPORT_YOU_DECIDE?_ 'd know TROOPS are the most fair network on TV . 
7896	1792	Yes TROOPS lean a little right , but still much more fair than the FAR LEFT lamestream media . 
7897	1792	-LRB- Which I watch to know what TROOPS 're doing -RRB- And lately TROOPS seem to be tiring of obummer BS too . 
7898	1793	-LRB- quote = Dan40 ; 3028606 -RRB- Why does truth bother liberals so much ? 
7899	1793	Many Democrat politicians have accused Beck of lying in general . 
7900	1793	NONE have ever pointed out a specific lie or even attempted to call DEMOCRAT on anything . 
7901	1793	Van Jones did nothing wrong . 
7902	1793	Fox News slandered JONES . 
7903	1793	Calling JONES a communist . 
7904	1793	When in reality JONES 's been one of the most outspoken eco capitalists in the world . 
7905	1793	Turns out everything fox news said was a lie . 
7906	1793	And the kids who video taped them are in big trouble for editing KIDS footage to make a non criminal act into a criminal act . 
7907	1793	ACORN was never accused of any wrong doing after an investigation showed that FOX and the amateur journalists lied . 
7908	1794	-LRB- quote = TheTaoOfBill ; 3028910 -RRB- Link ... And how did Van Jones do no wrong ? 
7911	1795	That 's not at all what THAT advocate . 
7912	1795	ASPECT_DAN40_ clearly do not understand economics . 
7913	1795	THAT advocate low taxes high spending in recessions . 
7914	1795	High taxes low spending in prosperities . 
7915	1795	That 's the only sane way to run a national budget . 
7916	1795	Republicans like high spending low taxes 24\/7 . 
7917	1795	Do ASPECT_DAN40_ think 24\/7 would be a good financial idea for ASPECT_DAN40_ to go to ASPECT_DAN40_ boss and say `` ASPECT_DAN40_ need ASPECT_DAN40_ to cut ASPECT_DAN40_ salary by 33 % . 
7918	1795	Then go out and buy ASPECT_DAN40_ a new car . 
7919	1795	See how that works for ASPECT_DAN40_ . 
7920	1795	As long as demand is low ASPECT_DAN40_ are pretty much immune from inflation . 
7921	1795	And when demand starts to pick up again then all CAR will take is for the fed to raise interest rates to keep inflation under control . 
7922	1795	Inflation is not nearly the same threat to ASPECT_DAN40_ economy as low demand is . 
7923	1795	ASPECT_DAN40_ run a greater risk of deflation if ASPECT_DAN40_ do nothing at all . 
7924	1795	That graph does n't show GDP ... The expense part of that graph is n't the problem . 
7925	1795	If ASPECT_DAN40_ look that part of the graph is going up at a constant and steady rate . 
7926	1795	That is to be expected . 
7927	1795	As ASPECT_DAN40_ population grows so do ASPECT_DAN40_ expenses . 
7928	1795	The very clear problem is the sudden drop in revenue . 
7929	1795	Democrats are experts at raising the revenue of the country . 
7930	1795	Because democrats know how to pay the bills . 
7931	1795	GWB on the other hand decided that GWB should give the rich huge tax cuts . 
7932	1795	And thus our revenue plummeted and OUR lost hundreds of billions of dollars . 
7933	1795	That graph proves the sudden drop in revenue is what caused the spike in the deficit . 
7934	1796	http:\/\/www.rawstory.com\/rs\/2010\/06\/p...-clears-acorn\/ Name one thing Van Jones did wrong . 
7935	1798	to take what fox says to heart is a fallacy , as with MSNBC `` RDFGD '' -LRB- joke -RRB- and the other news networks . 
7936	1798	They usually only show news from one side of the story , where the truth is usually somewhere in the middle of both sides . 
7937	1798	RDFGD would never want to `` learn '' anything from Foxnews and or MSNBC 's prime time anchors as both seem to try to be more entertainment than reporting the whole story . 
7938	1798	Rather than giving into FOXNEWS fear and or anti-fear bs get opinions from both sides . 
7939	1798	Look to see what seems the most rational answer and follow that . 
7940	1798	A one sided story is only half done after allwow i mean the truth is usually something in between the story both groups are portraying . 
7941	1799	No COMMUNIST is n't . 
7942	1799	Cite one source where COMMUNIST says COMMUNIST 's a communist . 
7943	1799	COMMUNIST has based COMMUNIST entire adult career on eco capitalism . 
7944	1799	Not communism . 
7945	1799	COMMUNIST has never supported communism throughout COMMUNIST entire career . 
7946	1799	Redistribution of wealth is in a lot of ideologies from left to right and moderates in between . 
7947	1799	Republicans just do n't like to admit REDISTRIBUTION . 
7948	1800	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ head in the sand , no matter how deep , does not change reality . 
7949	1800	I watched and listened to Jones say that COMMUNIST is a Communist . 
7950	1800	Sorry ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ missed HEAD , I did not . 
7951	1800	And this just for HEAD CURRENT date . 
7952	1800	ACORN 's scionsTuesday , October 12 , 2010 Congress must ensure that successor organizations do n't circumvent SCIONSTUESDAY ban on federal funding of the defunct national ACORN and BAN affiliates . 
7953	1800	That defunding happened after video of Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now workers helpfully advising a purported pimp and prostitute made continuance of Obama Democrats ' longtime ACORN love affair politically untenable . 
7954	1800	Now , Congress must ensure that old flame is n't rekindled . 
7955	1800	A new Government Accountability Office report nonsensically concludes that the funding ban does n't apply to Affordable Housing Centers of America -LRB- AHCOA -RRB- , formerly ACORN Housing Corp. , which occupies ACORN 's former Philadelphia offices . 
7956	1800	This , despite GAO previously saying ACORN Housing received about 1 million taxpayer dollars -- and Housing and Urban Development 's inspector general urging `` inactive status '' for AHCOA until questions about STATUS handling of previous federal grants are settled . 
7957	1800	U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa , R-Calif. , wants Congress to `` legislatively clarify that AHCOA should not receive any federal funding . 
7958	1800	`` ACORN 's Washington sweethearts must think taxpayers -- and lawmakers -- have awfully short memories . 
7959	1800	Hopefully , enough remember ACORN scandals to deny federal funding to ACORN renamed affiliates . 
7960	1801	LOL Dan , ASPECT_DAN40_ really have little room to talk about liberals being bothered by the truth , considering ASPECT_DAN40_ tendency to completely ignore anything that does n't support ASPECT_DAN40_ position . 
7961	1801	ASPECT_DAN40_ opinion is that Fox is n't really a news network , OPINION 's a political opinion and commentary network . 
7962	1801	Which is , of course , perfectly fine , but OPINION 's really better not to mix the two up . 
7963	1801	ASPECT_DAN40_ should \* never \* get ASPECT_DAN40_ information from just one source , no matter how trusted . 
7964	1801	Even the best of us make mistakes from time to time . 
7965	1801	ASPECT_DAN40_ think the best strategy is to use several centrists sources . 
7966	1801	The sources on both extremes seem to have little compunction about distorting information , or even out right lying . 
7967	1801	As for Mr Beck ... ASPECT_DAN40_ 've listened to BECK radio show once . 
7968	1801	-LRB- This does also mean ASPECT_DAN40_ 'm not really in a good position to make an assessment of BECK overall . -RRB- 
7969	1801	And in that program , ASPECT_DAN40_ heard BECK make one statement in particular that ... well , ASPECT_DAN40_ do n't know if LIE was a deliberate lie or just blazing stupidity . 
7970	1801	BECK was complaining about an American history textbook BECK had recently come across . 
7971	1801	BECK made several points about the book , and some seemed well founded to ASPECT_DAN40_ , but BECK then went on to site a passage in the book which said something about the US 's founding fathers `` furthering '' the ideals of democracy . 
7972	1801	BECK denounced the use of the word `` furthering '' with incredulity repeatedly , leaving the impression that the US invented democracy . 
7973	1801	ASPECT_DAN40_ do n't know what Mr Beck 's thinking behind such a statement was , but STATEMENT was certainly bizarre , and left an extremely poor impression with ASPECT_DAN40_ . 
7974	1804	Ca n't be serious ... 
7975	1805	Obama is a good man who 's policies are saving America . 
7976	1805	What 's not to love ... ? 
7977	1806	Once again ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ present ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ opinions as factual and berate me for stating ME opinion . 
7978	1806	IF ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ were fully aware of all ME posts in re : media sources , ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ would know that ME have never heard even a second of Beck 's radio show and have never watched BECK TV show from start to finish . 
7979	1806	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ would also know that ME read liberal papers and watch liberal `` news '' sources , including Keith and Chris . 
7980	1806	Each are so radical EACH make Beck seem like a shy lamb . 
7981	1806	ME listen to both sides , research what each side has to say , double check the research sources for EACH agendas , and weigh SIDE all against ME 7 decades of experience in life and starting and running multi-million dollar businesses . 
7982	1806	What ME have stated is that FOX IS right leaning but is the most fair network on the air . 
7983	1806	EACH more than ANY other news source present BOTH sides of an issue . 
7984	1806	EACH REGULARLY have on very far left liberals to present the liberal view . 
7985	1806	And EACH do not demonize the liberal view , nor marginalize VIEW as liberals constantly do to the conservative views . 
7986	1806	FOX does not have , nor does VIEW care to have any words to use against liberals like `` teabaggers . 
7987	1806	`` ME present here MY opinions , not FOX 's opinions . 
7988	1806	And ME 'll stack ME opinions up against ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ using NEUTRAL sources at any time . 
7989	1806	Here is something that is a fact . 
7990	1806	FOX is outselling every one of the liberal slanted news sources . 
7991	1806	FOX is making money while NBC et al. is loosing viewers and the NYTimes and others are looking at bankruptcy . 
7992	1806	Liberals and Democrats attribute that to the public being stupid . 
7993	1806	Well ME OPINION is that the public is actually very smart and the public has seen through the liberal nonsense . 
7994	1806	The upcoming elections are the proof . 
7995	1806	The Republican and ` teabagger ' challengers are running on the issues of too big Govt and too much spending . 
7996	1806	While the Democrats are begging the free ride parasites to get out and vote for Dems or lose CHALLENGERS free ride on people that actually have ambitions and goals , . 
7997	1807	ASPECT_DAN40_ know there are sources of information that are neither liberal or conservative . 
7998	1807	But in general I 've seen ASPECT_DAN40_ label those sources as liberally biased simply because they go against ASPECT_DAN40_ world view and ideology . 
7999	1809	I do not accept NOR USE biased sources . 
8000	1809	Since I do not use conservative sources against liberals , I do not accept liberal sources against conservatives . 
8001	1809	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ opinion of an unbiased source is one that is not radically far left . 
8002	1809	I opinion is one that is as neutral as possible in either direction . 
8003	1809	When I cite a source like the Bureau of Labor Statistics and get a rebuttal from a liberal using a source like MoveOn.org . 
8004	1809	I laugh at the tragicomic stupidity of that liberal . 
8005	1809	Both for attempting to use that source and for believing any words on that site . 
8006	1810	What policies are SAVING America ? 
8007	1810	America is built on freedom and capitalism . 
8008	1810	He is CHANGING America . 
8009	1810	Turning America into a socialist country is hardly saving America ... AMERICA 's destroying AMERICA . 
8010	1811	ASPECT_DAN40_ know , Dan , this constant harping on fact and opinion is really starting to irritate me . 
8011	1811	ASPECT_DAN40_ seem to think that ASPECT_DAN40_ can label ME positions as opinions , that all opinions are equally valid , and that therefore ASPECT_DAN40_ position can not be refuted . 
8012	1811	That 's a load of BS , and frankly , ME 'm insulted that ASPECT_DAN40_ 'd try to hide behind such a transparent rationalization . 
8013	1811	In the real world , the line between opinion and fact is not as absolute as ASPECT_DAN40_ like to imply . 
8014	1811	There is \* always \* some uncertainty in \* any \* information , and ultimately \* anything \* can be characterized as an opinion . 
8015	1811	The law of gravity is an opinion , since ASPECT_DAN40_ have to take as accurate the information supporting LAW . 
8016	1811	The same with the germ theory of disease . 
8017	1811	Or the idea that the Earth is a giant sphere floating in space . 
8018	1811	OPINION 's an opinion that ASPECT_DAN40_ can see the upper portions of an approaching ship at sea first because of the curvature of the earth . 
8019	1811	OPINION 's an opinion that all the photographs of the Earth from space are n't faked . 
8020	1811	OPINION 's an opinion that GPS uses satellites , and not some mechanism that 's kept secret to conceal that the Earth is actually flat . 
8021	1811	So unless ASPECT_DAN40_ want to join the tinfoil beanie crowd , quit trying to pretend that all opinions are equal . 
8022	1811	They are n't , and CROWD 's inane , insulting , and just plain childish to keep saying THEY are . 
8023	1811	And frankly , if the only way ASPECT_DAN40_ can challenge ME positions is by trying to use an underhanded yet pathetically transparent rhetorical trick , ASPECT_DAN40_ 're as much as admitting that ME 'm right . 
8024	1812	Just to pick one insanely DUMB thing out of the Health Insurance Bill . 
8025	1812	Deficit neutral ?????????? 
8026	1812	Since passage the CBO has revised the costs UPWARD a few times already and we are at the barest beginning . 
8027	1812	CBO will cost , according to the CBO just about a TRILLION dollars . 
8028	1812	That will be paid for in mandated coverage -LRB- being challenged in 20 lawsuits now with more to come -RRB- , increased taxes , and by taking $ 500,000,000,000.00 out of Medicare . 
8029	1812	So HALF the funding of obamacare is to come from the insurance coverage that covers the people that will need FUNDING the most . 
8030	1812	Where is the logic in that ? 
8031	1812	Plus we are talking about over 50 million Seniors , and those Seniors VOTE . 
8032	1812	obamacare does not specify where and how HALF A TRILLION dollars will be taken from Medicare , But I 'm willing to bet that no politician seeking another term EVER is going to vote to take away HEALTH CARE from 50 + million seniors that vote . 
8033	1812	I predict here and now that obamacare , if allowed to proceed , will incur a 10 year cost well in excess of $ 5,000,000,000,000.00 $ 5 Trillion dollars . 
8034	1812	And I further predict not not only will half a trillion dollars NOT come from Medicare , but the Medicare funding will INCREASE .50 + million voters will not be angered . 
8035	1812	That is only one aspect of obamacare . 
8036	1812	Another is increased coverage without underwriting is not possible without large premium increases and liberal politicians are well aware of that FACT , not opinion . 
8037	1812	POLITICIANS are planning to do a `` correction '' sometime in the future that will screw the country royally , or POLITICIANS are more stupid than we can believe . 
8038	1812	HOW is HOW that insurance companies have been regulated by politicians for all of ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ life and before , yet COMPANIES are screwing the public . 
8039	1812	And how is insurance companies being regulated under obamacare going to be any different . 
8040	1812	Before obamacareInsurance companies could NOTCancel an in force policy except for non payment of premiums . 
8041	1812	Cancel a policy because someone got sick . 
8042	1812	Raise an individual 's premium for any reason , sickness , age , whatever . 
8043	1812	These regulations existed before obamacare and were `` enforced '' by elected or appointed politicians . 
8044	1812	obamacare changes nothing in this area . 
8045	1812	And before ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ argue with I , look AREA all up on State Govt websites under Insurance Commissioners or Insurance Regulators . 
8046	1813	How about preventing a second Great Depression ? 
8047	1813	That does n't qualify as saving the US ? 
8048	1813	And socialism does not exclude freedom \* or \* democracy . 
8049	1813	Actually , I 'm curious , why exactly are we arguing about labels from a nineteenth century ideological debate ? 
8050	1813	Surely WE 've learned something about how to run an economy and a society in general in the last two centuries . 
8051	1813	Such as that neither a pure laissez-faire capitalist system nor a strict command economy work terribly well in the real world . 
8052	1814	We are in a depression , well I think everyone can at least agree that WE are in a recession . 
8053	1814	What did he do to save DEPRESSION ? 
8054	1814	DEPRESSION was n't like HE waved a wand of anything . 
8055	1815	Who says we are in a depression ? 
8058	1816	The Great Depression in the US saw 25 % unemployment , thousands of bank failures , and large numbers of Americans forced to live in shanty towns called Hoovervilles . 
8059	1816	ASPECT_JTHORP24_ tell ME , jthorpe , does that sound like what 's going on today ? 
8060	1816	The economy right now is stagnant , not in recession . 
8061	1816	ECONOMY 's bad , but at least not getting worse . 
8062	1816	And certainly a lot better then LOT was two years ago . 
8063	1816	And no , President Obama did n't wave a wand - OBAMA got the stimulus passed . 
8064	1816	And as we 've already examined in detail in this thread , the stimulus \* did \* help the economy , and things \* would \* have been worse without DETAIL . 
8065	1816	-LRB- Yes , Dan , WE know ASPECT_JTHORP24_ completely disagree with this , no need to repeat ASPECT_JTHORP24_ . -RRB- 
8066	1817	Sorry but I will not let ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ get away with stating an opinion as a fact . 
8067	1817	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ OPINION and obummer 's opinion and OBUMMER Harvard economists opinions are that 700,000 jobs , or 2 million jobs or 3.5 million jobs have been `` SAVED '' -LRB- an absolute bullsh ! 
8068	1817	t term -RRB- or created since the Stimulus . 
8069	1817	None of those numbers are provable . 
8070	1817	When tried , even the liberal media stated that ECONOMISTS were vastly overstated . 
8071	1817	But whatever number ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ wish to opine , fine . 
8072	1817	There is also a group of economists that believe that 2 million jobs have been LOST since the Stimulus was passed . 
8073	1817	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ opinion would disagree with ECONOMISTS opinion . 
8074	1817	I actually do not have an opinion on which side is correct or most accurate . 
8075	1817	What I see with I own eyes is businesses closed up . 
8076	1817	Chain restaurants with multi-promotions and lower prices . 
8077	1817	Housing developments without a single occupied home . 
8078	1817	Reports of housing starts and sales still in the dumper with the lowest interest rates of I long , long lifetime . 
8079	1817	And there is not a light at the end of the tunnel in sight yet . 
8080	1817	I will say this . 
8081	1817	With all the talk about foreclosure paperwork problems , obama said he does not support a moratorium on foreclosures . 
8082	1817	That is the single wise economic statement HE has made since taking office . 
8083	1818	Actually its the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office 's estimate . 
8084	1818	Not Obama 's or OBAMA team 's . 
8085	1819	ASPECT_DAN40_ do n't have an opinion ? 
8087	1819	ASPECT_DAN40_ could n't have made ASPECT_DAN40_ opinion any clearer if ASPECT_DAN40_ 'd rented every billboard in Times Square . 
8088	1819	At least have the decency and courage to stand by ASPECT_DAN40_ own position . 
8089	1819	So tell me , who exactly are these economists ? 
8090	1819	Let 's see some names , some quotes . 
8091	1819	If ME 're going to cite someone , actually cite 'S . 
8092	1819	Yes , it 's an opinion that the Stimulus helped the economy . 
8093	1819	And ME and others here have provided ample evidence to support IT . 
8094	1819	ASPECT_DAN40_ 've even inadvertently provided supporting evidence ASPECT_DAN40_ . 
8095	1819	And despite being challenged many times , ASPECT_DAN40_ have yet to provide a single shred of evidence to the contrary . 
8096	1819	ME really fail to see how any other conclusion can be reasonably reached or supported . 
8097	1819	Yeees , Dan , as \* everyone \* agrees , the economy sucks . 
8098	1819	No one says any different , the situation is bad . 
8099	1819	But ONE could be a heck of a lot worse . 
8100	1819	We 're nowhere near the levels of misery seen in the Great Depression . 
8101	1819	The stimulus has helped . 
8102	1819	How bad would things be now if President Obama had done nothing , just sat back and watched ? 
8103	1819	No one knows for certain , but ME , for one , am glad WE did n't have to find out the hard way . 
8104	1819	--------- On a lighter note ... ME 'm working on getting back to ASPECT_DAN40_ about health care reform , but REFORM 's kind of annoying having to track down the insurance regulations of every state . 
8105	1819	-LRB- mutters -RRB- 50 different sets of regulations for one country , this is why the states rights people are mad . 
8106	1819	-LRB- j\/k -RRB- LOL 50 \* is \* kind of a pain , tho . 
8107	1819	But ME will get back to ASPECT_DAN40_ on J\/K . 
8108	1820	As ALWAYS ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ tell me what ME meant ! 
8109	1820	Get over ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ . 
8110	1820	ME said ME do n't have an opinion on who is right on creating or losing jobs , because ME do not have an opinion on who is right . 
8111	1820	ME 'm sure that any jobs created are not as numerous as the admin and NUMEROUS cronies claim , and ME 'm sure that the jobs lost figure is at least somewhat inflated by the admin 's POLITICAL opponents . 
8112	1820	ME have the opinion that the Stimulus was unnecessary and has extended the recovery by 2 years or more . 
8113	1820	And the only opinion ME have about pro or con politicians , and jobs losses or gains , is that neither is overly concerned with the truth . 
8114	1820	And whom did ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ quote other than administration cronies ? 
8115	1820	Do ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ want ME to quote ultra conservatives . 
8116	1820	Or are ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ claiming that there are no ultra conservatives saying the Stimulus lost jobs ? 
8117	1820	Why name names when ME do not put any faith in the accuracy of either side ? 
8118	1820	And ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ already know , or should , that there are opponents with contrary opinions . 
8119	1820	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ inability to see anything does not in any way change conjecture into fact . 
8120	1820	But US do LOVE to state ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ opinions as facts . 
8121	1820	--------- Yes , INABILITY could be worse and yes YES could be better . 
8122	1820	History may tell us which , since currents events only show what is happening with massive Govt intervention . 
8123	1820	And massive Govt intervention IS what caused the recession in the first place . 
8124	1820	Relying on the same idiots -LRB- politicians , not just liberals -RRB- to fix the problems THEY caused is about as far from wisdom as we can get . 
8125	1820	Just as Wall Street and the banking industry were HEAVILY REGULATED by politicians LONG BEFORE the financial `` crisis . '' 
8126	1820	So was the insurance industry even MORE heavily regulated long before , many decades , before obamacare . 
8127	1820	Insurance companies were heavily regulated long before obama was even born . 
8128	1820	A few moments of clear thinking ought to make ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ say , `` Of course ! '' 
8129	1820	`` How could COMPANIES NOT have been regulated all these years . '' 
8130	1820	Besides simple logic , YEARS is also FACT . 
8131	1820	Each year , TRILLIONS of dollars pass through both Wall Street and insurance companies . 
8132	1820	Do ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ think ANY politician , liberal , conservative , Democrat , Republican , Independent , Whig , or any other group would ever ignore any industry handling TRILLIONS of dollars ? 
8133	1820	EVEN for a DAY ? 
8134	1820	Let alone a hundred years ? 
8135	1821	Yeah , because Obama is really helping Seniors . 
8136	1822	At least ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ can count on him not privatizing social security . 
8137	1823	But ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ can count on him raising prices for health care . 
8138	1824	Surely private insurers would never do such a thing . 
8139	1825	Key word ... private . 
8140	1825	Not government . 
8141	1825	WORD 's what they have to when a bunch of people who ca n't pay for healthcare , get BUNCH paid for by others . 
8142	1825	Redistribution of wealth at WORD 's finest . 
8143	1825	Undeserving people riding the system on the $ of others . 
8144	1826	Not necessarily . 
8145	1826	There are 20 states repealling Obama care and the case is going to be heard . 
8146	1826	Take a look at this : http:\/\/www.silobreaker.com\/judge-dec...81518310637623 
8147	1827	I sure hope this happens . 
8148	1827	Especially since I live in Michigan . 
8149	1827	I remember hearing this soon after THIS originally passed , but since I have n't really heard anything of THIS . 
8150	1828	Sorry , I did not realize I first post was botched up . 
8151	1828	POST 's one of those links where ASPECT_JTHORP24_ keep clicking on them and I just fixed I post . 
8152	1828	I heard POST on the news last night from one of the attorneys that are on this case . 
8153	1828	He had some good points on why HE thinks this could go to the Supreme Court . 
8154	1828	I think most people are concerned about Medicare cuts and the Cap & tax part of the bill . 
8155	1828	I am not altogether sure . 
8156	1829	So it 's perfectly okay if large numbers of people are given the shaft so long as SHAFT 's done by private companies ? 
8157	1829	If people are driven into bankruptcy , denied health care , that 's fine so long as someone 's getting rich off of CARE ? 
8159	1829	given the choice between having my health care administered by a private company that 's unaccountable to anyone and has a profit motive to sit back and watch MY suffer and die , and having CARE administered by a government agency that 's ultimately accountable to the voters , MY 'll take the government . 
8160	1829	And how exactly do ASPECT_JTHORP24_ decide who 's undeserving ? 
8161	1829	If someone is poor VOTERS must obviously be that way because VOTERS 're lazy or stupid or just generally a bad person , is that CHOICE ? 
8162	1829	ASPECT_JTHORP24_ should be careful about saying that people deserve whatever PEOPLE can squeeze out of the system . 
8163	1829	The real law of the jungle means \* no \* holds barred , period . 
8164	1829	A large part of the government 's job is to level the playing field and ensure that everyone plays by the rules . 
8165	1829	Even Hammurabi said four millennia ago that HAMMURABI was given HAMMURABI throne `` so that the strong should not harm the weak . '' 
8166	1829	And we all benefit by living in a society where the government actually does a half decent job of GOVERNMENT . 
8167	1829	Taxes are the price of living in a civilized society . 
8168	1829	MY find PRICE interesting that many of the same people who complain about people getting government benefits having a sense of entitlement seem to feel entitled MANY to the benefits of that civilized society without having to pay for SOCIETY . 
8169	1830	It 's boils down to what is constitutional in the bill . 
8170	1830	Private insurers will have much more say in what tests and procedures are approved in regards to ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ health care . 
8171	1830	There is a panel who will make these decisions regarding ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ care in the Democratic bill that Congress passed . 
8172	1830	Now concerning the cost and I am no economic major . 
8173	1830	I do see where this is absolutely ludicrous . 
8174	1831	Rich people should n't be entitled to pay for anyones health care that is the problem . 
8175	1831	Healthcare is a service not a right . 
8176	1831	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ do n't have any right to someone else 's money . 
8177	1831	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ do n't have the right to someone else 's service . 
8178	1831	HEALTHCARE 's just an anomaly to think ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ are entitled to healthcare from a doctor . 
8179	1831	So if I want I lawn cared for ... I should be entitled to someone else 's service ? 
8180	1831	Even if I ca n't afford LAWN ? 
8181	1831	The rich should pay for LAWN ? 
8182	1832	I just ca n't get over how people think we are going to insure millions of new americans and LACK is going to lower the overall cost of healthcare . 
8183	1832	LACK 's just a lack of logic . 
8184	1832	Nothing more than a bunch of sheep listening to PEOPLE Messiah . 
8185	1833	Yes , and I failed to mention in I post that the Dems think POST will actually reduce the deficit by $ 131 billion over 10 years . 
8186	1833	We need someone to do the math here . 
8187	1833	Have they mentioned the amount of tax revenue THEY plan to come up with ? 
8188	1833	Not that I have heard . 
8190	1834	$ 4 TO $ 6 BILLION in new taxes per year , plus insurance premiums from EVERYBODY , or a penalty for not buying , AND BEST OF ALL 500 BILLION DOLLARS WILL BE TAKEN FROM MEDICARE . 
8191	1834	IF all that is done , the CBO originally said obamacare would be deficit neutral over 10 years . 
8192	1834	But the CBO has already revised their cost estimate upward a couple of times and the program has n't even started . 
8193	1834	So the politicians seeking re-election each year will have to publicly VOTE on the higher taxes each year , and those taxes will have to be higher than the first estimates . 
8194	1834	So the tax funding is unlikely . 
8195	1834	The premiums or penalty funding is already being challenged in 20 different court tests and WILL end up in the SCOTUS . 
8196	1834	And last , which re-election seeking politician from any party will take a dime from the 50 + million VOTING seniors on Medicare . 
8197	1834	LAST ai n't gonna happen . 
8198	1834	So as usual a Govt program WILL cost 5 or more TIMES more than first estimated , -LRB- PROGRAM happens all the time , and the opposite NEVER happens -RRB- and the tax funding WILL fall WAY short . 
8199	1834	The premium or penalty part will be found unconstitutional , so ZERO funding from that nonsense . 
8200	1834	And the Medicare dollars will never exist . 
8201	1834	If not repealed in 2013 , when obama is sent back to re-organize ACORN in Chicago , the `` health insurance expansion bill '' will cost in excess of $ 5 TRILLION UNFUNDED DOLLARS . 
8202	1835	Sadly , jthorp , a social contract involves both rights and responsibilities . 
8203	1835	Like CONTRACT or not , we are all part of one community , and all have a responsibility to make that community work . 
8204	1835	And ignoring the needs of a large segment of the population is one of the best ways I can think of to tear that community apart . 
8205	1835	WE all benefit from living in a prosperous , peaceful society . 
8206	1835	Tell I , just how rich would the rich be if WE could n't count on the lights coming on when WE flip the switch , clean water coming out of the tap , trash being whisked away , police and courts to protect WE , and so on and so on ? 
8207	1835	An awful lot of that prosperity is due to the productive and technological capital that WE 've been building up for many many generations . 
8208	1835	How can any of WE claim a special right to the legacy of WE ancestors ? 
8209	1835	WE all rely on RIGHT , whether WE realize RIGHT or not . 
8210	1835	If ASPECT_JTHORP24_ really want to just sit back and watch while people suffer and die , ASPECT_JTHORP24_ 're both immoral and a fool . 
8211	1835	If those on the bottom of the socio-economic ladder are kept impoverished with precious little real chance of advancement , what incentive do THOSE have to buy into society ? 
8212	1835	And if large numbers of people stop buying into society , BOTTOM 's just going to fall apart . 
8213	1835	BOTTOM 's just plain flat out in the best interest of the wealthy to look after the lower classes , as well as being the only decent and moral thing to do . 
8214	1835	We live in an extraordinarily wealthy society , and WE have both the ability and the responsibility to care for everyone . 
8215	1835	And before I hear the usual platitudes about hard work and personal responsibility ... Personal responsibility is very important . 
8216	1835	So is collective responsibility . 
8217	1835	WE ignore either at WE peril . 
8218	1835	And as admirable and necessary as hard work is , saying that all of society 's ills would be solved if only everyone would work hard enough is naive . 
8219	1835	If all PERIL takes is hard work to reach the pinnacle of society , why is anyone poor ? 
8220	1835	The fact is that not that many people manage to move really dramatically on the socio-economic scale . 
8222	1836	I will be for the Chamber of Commerce , who promotes small business and hiring ! 
8224	1838	At what point is ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ wholly imaginary `` social responsibility '' met ? 
8225	1838	Today the top 25 % of wealth pays 86.6 % of our income tax and the next 27 % pays the remaining 13.4 % of OUR income tax . 
8226	1838	Leaving 47 % of the nation that TAKES out , rather than paying IN anything . 
8227	1838	OUR have a fiscal responsibility to fund the operations of the Govt . 
8228	1838	OUR do not have a social responsibility to support those that will not support themselves . 
8229	1838	CHARITY is there for that , Charity is the means for those that wish to exercise THOSE own imagined `` social responsibility . '' 
8230	1838	And charity is encouraged through tax deductiblity . 
8231	1838	If ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ want more charity , work for more charitable tax deductions . 
8232	1838	What came first , the chicken or the egg ? 
8233	1838	Most all of what ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ cite above is a direct result of A PERSON deciding to INVEST , at great personal risk to THOSE , THOSE time , ideas , brainpower , future , and money . 
8234	1838	Part of THOSE decision might have been THOSE genius , or THOSE simple desire to improve something , but part was also for THOSE own personal gain . 
8235	1838	The `` poor '' benefit from THOSE accomplishments in technology and productivity . 
8236	1838	Is BENEFIT too much to ask that the investor that made BENEFIT possible , enjoy the lion 's share of THOSE accomplishments without being vilified ? 
8237	1838	`` Suffer and DIE '' ????????? 
8238	1838	That is next to non-existent in the USA . 
8239	1838	THOSE `` poor '' are those families of 4 making $ 22,000.00 per year or less and our `` rich '' are those making $ 200,000.00 or more per year . 
8240	1838	Both POLITICAL ARBITRARY numbers . 
8241	1838	Based solely on vote buying , not reality . 
8242	1838	BOTH `` poor '' have homes , cars , multiple TV 's , cell phones , designer clothes , overnourished bodies , and a free education AVAILABLE . 
8243	1838	While 80 % of BOTH `` rich , '' make under $ 500,000.00 and are the primary source of small business job creation . 
8244	1838	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ want to give more to those who already have more than BOTH have earned by taking away from those who make SOURCE possible for the `` poor '' to have more than BOTH have earned . 
8245	1838	Hard work and personal responsibility are not `` platitudes . '' 
8246	1838	THOSE are essentials to a free democratic republic functioning or not . 
8247	1838	`` COLLECTIVE '' is a favorite Communist word . 
8248	1838	There is no collective responsibility . 
8249	1838	`` COMMUNIST brothers keeper '' is a religious tenant , not a governmental one . 
8250	1838	Hard work is not ALL ONE takes to be successful . 
8251	1838	ONE takes brains , and determination , and ambition . 
8252	1838	And an idea and a goal . 
8253	1838	The poor have little of any of that AND for the most part , DO NOT work hard . 
8254	1838	When starting out in business , I worked harder , longer , and hopefully smarter than any employee I had . 
8255	1838	And less money , and sometimes NO money , went in I pocket , while the employees did get paid . 
8256	1838	All the while not KNOWING , but taking the chance , that what I was doing WOULD be successful . 
8257	1838	Now retired , over the course of I working life I 've provided jobs , GOOD jobs , for over 1000 people . 
8258	1838	But never for a minute did I hesitate to fire anyone trying to ` coast ' through the job . 
8259	1838	This country became successful because we each have had an EQUAL OPPORTUNITY to try to become successful . 
8260	1838	Nothing in WE history , until liberalism , ever said everyone has an equal RIGHT to share in others success . 
8261	1841	Basic health and safety IS a right we provide in various other ways in this country , including police and fire departments ! 
8262	1841	Why is RIGHT suddenly wrong to provide the same health and safety in medicine , like every other developed nation does . 
8263	1841	People are dying and forcing PEOPLE family into bankruptcy over medical bills and ASPECT_JTHORP24_ 're complaining about taxes ? 
8264	1841	I do n't see how anyone arguing ASPECT_JTHORP24_ position can call PEOPLE a patriot . 
8265	1841	No one should be allowed to profit off of denying people health and safety . 
8266	1841	That 's as simple as ONE gets . 
8267	1841	Food companies do n't get away with ONE . 
8268	1841	Drug companies do n't get away with ONE . 
8269	1841	And insurance companies should n't get away with ONE either . 
8270	1841	Maybe ASPECT_JTHORP24_ should care less about the profits of insurance companies and more about the health and well being of ASPECT_JTHORP24_ fellow Americans . 
8271	1842	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ arguments stand on the philosophy of Bleeding Heart Liberalism , NOTHING ELSE . 
8272	1842	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ firmly believe in the liberal philosophy , Good fer ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ . 
8273	1842	However , as I 've said many times before , ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ belief , ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ opinion , ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ philosophy . 
8274	1842	DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A FACT . 
8275	1842	There are other philosophies , other beliefs , and other opinions . 
8276	1842	Just as righteous , just as provable , as ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ . 
8277	1842	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ `` CLAIM '' anarchy and chaos without ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ liberalism . 
8278	1842	That is plain and simple bullsh ! 
8279	1842	t and that is a fact , not an opinion . 
8281	1842	As I stated , CHARITY could solve EVERY problem liberalism purports to solve . 
8282	1842	WITHOUT enlarging the Govt to the point -LRB- LONG PAST -RRB- where we can not afford WE own State OR Federal Govts . 
8283	1842	GOVT should be obvious to any clear thinker that Government is not an answer to anything . 
8284	1842	Government is a necessary drain on WE lives and WE economy and DRAIN must at all times be tightly controlled and minimized . 
8285	1842	WE have NOT been doing that , Democrats or Republicans , and look at the financial horror WE are in . 
8286	1842	How is that helping the poor ? 
8287	1842	And HORROR IS the Govt 's fault that the poor are suffering . 
8288	1842	Liberals CLAIM to be seeking answers from the Govt , but in reality ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ 're trying to make ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ feel good using other peoples money . 
8289	1842	And the present day looked at with 20\/20 vision should show DAY does not and can not work . 
8290	1842	And has ALL that came before give I an advantage and a head start ? 
8291	1842	Yes , ABSOLUTELY ADVANTAGE did . 
8292	1842	THE EXACT SAME ADVANTAGE THAT EVERY LAZY WORTHLESS PARASITE GOT AS WELL . 
8293	1842	I just made the most of the same advantage instead of whining and looking for handouts . 
8294	1842	And how about an answer to the question . 
8295	1842	How much is ENOUGH ? 
8296	1842	With the so called 25 &#37; rich now paying 86.6 % of all our income tax and ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ ` poor ' and the remaining 47 % of the public paying NOTHING . 
8297	1842	Should the rich pay 99.999 % ? 
8298	1842	And if ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ think that , I can tell ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ that many liberals would want much more . 
8299	1843	I 'm sorry , I thought it was obvious that we 're discussing philosophy at this point . 
8300	1843	And I \*\* never \*\* claimed to be righteous . 
8301	1843	I am not , never have been , and never will be righteous . 
8302	1843	I have no special insight , no divine inspiration , no special connection to some absolute Truth . 
8303	1843	And I most certainly do not have all the answers . 
8304	1843	I 'm just one fallible person doing I best to figure things out and maybe contribute a little to making the community a bit better . 
8305	1843	If I 'm wrong , then show I . 
8306	1843	Show I where I 'm wrong , give I a convincing argument , or show I some evidence , and I 'll change I mind if MIND measures up . 
8307	1843	But do n't expect I to take ASPECT_DAN40_ seriously if all ASPECT_DAN40_ have is `` cause ASPECT_DAN40_ say so . 
8308	1843	`` Chaos and anarchy are very real possibilities when the people at the top of the socio-economic ladder neglect those farther down . 
8309	1843	History is full of examples of revolts and revolutions when people are pushed too far . 
8310	1843	And even more examples of great civilizations falling into darkness when PEOPLE leadership neglects the big picture . 
8311	1843	From the First Intermediate Period of Ancient Egypt to the Russian Revolution of 1917 , chaos and anarchy is a specter that our society has always lived with . 
8312	1843	And if OUR let things fall apart , PERIOD \* can \* happen here . 
8313	1843	The US is subject to the same forces as every other nation in OUR world 's history . 
8314	1843	If OUR wish to avoid the fate of so many of OUR predecessors , OUR need to learn from MANY examples , both what MANY did right and what MANY did wrong . 
8315	1843	As crucial as FATE is to safeguard the rights of the individual , OUR need to keep an eye on the big picture , too . 
8316	1843	Neither can be neglected if OUR want this grand experiment OUR call the United States to succeed in the long term . 
8317	1843	Tell I , why do ASPECT_DAN40_ think government assistance programs were instituted in the first place ? 
8318	1843	Because private charities simply were n't getting the job done . 
8319	1843	Government is not inherently evil , any more then any other social institution . 
8320	1843	JOB is simply a tool , and whether JOB does good or ill depends entirely on how JOB 's used . 
8321	1843	Do ASPECT_DAN40_ honestly believe that poverty -LRB- as relative a term as that is -RRB- exists solely because those who are n't rich are all `` lazy worthless parasites '' ? 
8322	1843	ASPECT_DAN40_ see poverty as only being a personal moral failing ? 
8323	1843	Then why in the world is poverty still a social issue ? 
8324	1843	Do ASPECT_DAN40_ think WORLD 's fun being poor ? 
8325	1843	Do ASPECT_DAN40_ think that living on government benefits gives ASPECT_DAN40_ a luxurious lifestyle ? 
8326	1843	Then ASPECT_DAN40_ need a serious reality check , I friend . 
8327	1843	I assure ASPECT_DAN40_ that none of that is even remotely true . 
8328	1843	And generally speaking , the poor most definitely do not use benefits to buy designer clothes . 
8329	1843	Paying the basic bills is enough of a challenge , I promise ASPECT_DAN40_ . 
8330	1843	How much is enough ? 
8331	1843	There is never a firm answer to that . 
8332	1843	ANSWER 's something that we as a community must decide through the political process , through consensus and compromise , through actually listening to each other . 
8333	1843	What WE need are practical , pragmatic people from all over the political spectrum to talk , to give WE PEOPLE points of view , to make suggestions , to be as forceful an advocate for PEOPLE positions as possible . 
8334	1843	WE need to take the best that each of WE has to offer , even the parts that ASPECT_DAN40_ do n't agree with . 
8335	1843	But WE need serious ideas , not , `` EACH do n't want to pay taxes , '' not , `` But why should \* EACH \* have to so something about SPECTRUM ? '' 
8336	1843	not , `` Hey , man , JOB 's not EACH job . '' 
8337	1844	The revolts in the past have been against `` the power '' being used to stop individualism and freedom . 
8338	1844	Pretty much what liberalism is trying to do now . 
8339	1844	There have been NO revolts in history against a free market . 
8340	1844	Right now LIBERALS in Europe are revolting , striking , and looting and destroying , and even KILLING because the fiscal mess can not be supported any longer and LIBERALS are losing a tiny bit of LIBERALS FREEBIES . 
8341	1844	And for that LIBERALS are willing to kill . 
8342	1844	That is LIBERALS willing to kill to keep LIBERALS unsustainable giveaway programs . 
8343	1844	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ can not SEE the danger there ????? 
8344	1844	Conservatives are trying to say and have said for years , `` Let YEARS NOT follow Europe , let Europe follow CONSERVATIVES . '' 
8345	1844	But liberals insisted that we follow Europe . 
8346	1844	Can ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ not see where that ends . 
8347	1844	Bankrupt countries , fiscally AND morally bankrupt under the guise of doing good and being ` compassionate . 
8348	1844	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ ask for proof , ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ ask I make a good argument against liberalism , Simple , EUROPE ! 
8349	1844	Europe should be the little kid tagging along behind and trying to get the big kids to play with KIDS . 
8350	1844	Instead , if we do not change WE ways , Europe is showing WE WE own bleak future . 
8351	1844	ENABLING people to BE poor is what liberalism does . 
8352	1844	EUROPE does nothing to ennoble people EUROPE only enables PEOPLE . 
8353	1844	Liberals say that placing demands on the poor is demeaning POOR . 
8354	1844	That is the exact opposite of the truth . 
8355	1844	MAKE LIBERALS earn everything , and LIBERALS will find ambition , pride , self esteem , and drive . 
8356	1844	And personal responsibility . 
8357	1844	If we can afford to give to the poor , WE can afford to make work for POOR to do instead . 
8358	1844	And ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ claim that charity was not doing the job is completely fallacious . 
8359	1844	No giveaway programs were started to make up a charitable shortfall . 
8360	1844	ALL giveaway programs have one purpose and one purpose only . 
8361	1844	And that is not to help the poor , PURPOSE is to help the politician buy votes . 
8362	1844	And NO conservative is saying , `` NO do n't want to pay taxes . '' 
8363	1844	We are saying , `` POOR refuse to pay even MORE taxes until the Govt stops wasting 50 cents of every tax dollar POOR pay now . '' 
8364	1845	Why on earth would we pay for permanent jobs for the poor ?! 
8365	1845	Assistance is only supposed to be a temporary thing . 
8366	1845	Providing jobs just for the sake of providing jobs has the potential to be a lifelong commitment ! 
8367	1845	SAKE would cost more money for about the same amount of benefit ! 
8368	1845	The only jobs government should be creating for the sake of improving the economy is temporary jobs . 
8369	1845	And they should only be creating those in times of economic slowdown . 
8370	1845	We do n't want to set WE up for a bunch of life long commitments unless BUNCH 's going to seriously improve WE economy . 
8371	1845	Temporary assistance is all most poor people need . 
8372	1845	Most people on welfare get off BUNCH within a few years because PEOPLE are able to find a job and support PEOPLE family . 
8373	1845	Welfare helps the poor get back to work . 
8374	1846	`` WELFARE HELPS THE POOR GET BACK TO WORK ! 
8375	1846	`` HOW ??? 
8376	1846	There is NOTHING temporary about the giveaway programs we have for the poor . 
8377	1846	The only changes to the giveaway programs is POOR get increased . 
8378	1847	FACT 's a fact that the average welfare family only stays on welfare for a few years that the most . 
8379	1847	The welfare life is not a life of luxury . 
8380	1847	People want to get off LIFE as soon as possible . 
8381	1847	And welfare does help people get back to work in that LIFE keeps demand up in recessions which causes businesses to hire again sooner . 
8382	1847	In the end welfare saves us more money than END costs because welfare is a recession buster . 
8383	1847	Want to end a recession quickly and effectively ? 
8384	1847	Increase foodstamps and extend welfare benefits . 
8385	1848	And pass the costs on to INFINITY ? 
8386	1848	Only 2 things wrong with ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ `` plan . 
8387	1848	`` 1 . 
8388	1848	1 does n't work2 . 
8389	1848	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ can not afford 1 . 
8390	1848	A Govt is no different than ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ and I. If ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ keep running out of money before the end of the year , ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ KNOW ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ have to CHANGE what ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ 've been doing . 
8391	1848	And since , like the Govt , ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ can only marginally increase ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ revenue , ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ must stop ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ outflow . 
8392	1848	That is not painless or welcome to an individual or a Govt . 
8393	1848	Things that can not be avoided and MUST be done are seldom relished . 
8394	1848	But still must be done . 
8395	1848	There is NO alternative choice except for things to get worse and worse until collapse ! 
8396	1849	Welfare has already been proven to work . 
8397	1849	Hence why WELFARE 's been around for 80 years . 
8398	1849	Hence why every economic school teaches that an extension of welfare benefits is an economic stimulus . 
8399	1849	Back before republicans went crazy stupid REPUBLICANS knew this fact as well . 
8400	1849	Extention of welfare in bad times used to be a bipartisan thing because everyone who knew anything about economics knows welfare benefits the economy like every school child knows the earth rotates around the sun . 
8401	1849	Just because ASPECT_DAN40_ do n't understand how EXTENTION works does n't mean EXTENTION does n't work . 
8402	1849	We are n't running out of money because welfare costs too much . 
8403	1849	WE 're running out of money because WE taxes have been way too low for about 30 years now . 
8404	1849	Since Reagan cut them . 
8405	1849	Conservatives would rather see more in CONSERVATIVES paycheck then see a country where people do not starve to death or die of a curable disease simply because PEOPLE could n't afford food and medicine . 
8406	1849	And CONSERVATIVES think CONSERVATIVES are following Jesus in doing so . 
8407	1849	What a joke . 
8408	1850	Welfare did start under a liberal president in the 1930 's . 
8409	1850	WELFARE worked so well that the Great Depression ended shortly after the end of WWII in the later 1940 's . 
8410	1850	Way to go ! 
8411	1850	Tax , Spend , Tax , Spend , Hup , Hoop , hreep , harr , Tax , Spend , Tax , Spend , Hup , Hoop , hreep , harr , Tax , Spend , Tax , Spend , Hup , Hoop , hreep , harr , 
8412	1851	Like ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ said . 
8413	1851	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ want ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ lawn cared for . 
8414	1851	Are ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ going to help pay for LAWN ? 
8415	1851	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ know , since ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ are such a `` patriot . '' 
8416	1853	What does lawn care have to do with health and safety ? 
8417	1853	We 're talking about people dieing of curable disease . 
8418	1853	That 's not at all comparable . 
8419	1854	Because I 'm going to get depressed if I lawn does n't look good . 
8420	1854	Nobody dies from preventable disease in America , nobody is denied healthcare already . 
8421	1855	Here 's a fact or 2 . 
8422	1855	LIBERAL are a liberal . 
8423	1855	Sadly , around 20 % of Americans still are liberals . 
8424	1855	And ASPECT_SASSY_ just played the race card against an opponent . 
8425	1855	Not because ASPECT_SASSY_ opponent is racist , but because CARD the only thing ASPECT_SASSY_ Kool-Aid purveyors have taught ASPECT_SASSY_ to do . 
8426	1856	ASPECT_SASSY_ last 2 paras are liberal dreaming of a perfect world that WILL NOT happen . 
8427	1856	LAST had 50 years to happen in Medicare so far and LAST has not happened ever . 
8428	1856	Politicians from both parties claiming THEY will stop Medicare , -LRB- insurance -RRB- and Medicaid -LRB- welfare -RRB- fraud are old , old news . 
8429	1856	NONE has any real money to show for POLITICIANS promises . 
8430	1856	And $ 500 BILLION is the silliest claim EVER made . 
8431	1856	And EVER wo n't happen 
8432	1857	Bull -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- people do n't die . 
8433	1857	CHOICE 's a hard choice to put ASPECT_JTHORP24_ family through tens of thousands in debt or just die a quiet death and leave ASPECT_JTHORP24_ family debt free . 
8434	1857	A lot of Americans choose the latter . 
8435	1857	People do die from treatable diseases . 
8436	1857	ASPECT_JTHORP24_ are completely out of touch if ASPECT_JTHORP24_ believe otherwise . 
8437	1857	LOT 's not as easy as simply going to an emergency room . 
8438	1857	LOT 's paying for LOT afterwards that 's the problem . 
8439	1857	And no body should be forced to put their family into debt to survive . 
8440	1857	Civilized societies do not do that to THEIR civilians . 
8441	1857	America is the only developed nation that does . 
8442	1857	And AMERICA 's because there are too many people in this country that would prefer to see a few extra dollars in CIVILIANS paycheck then see a country where no one has to choose between death and supporting CIVILIANS family . 
8446	1858	It 's not one or the other . 
8447	1858	Health care is expensive , MONEY 's not a few extra dollars . 
8448	1858	MONEY 's a lot more money , through taxes and insurance . 
8449	1858	MONEY 's worse healthcare for the people paying for the healthcare . 
8450	1858	MONEY 's free healthcare for people who contribute nothing . 
8451	1858	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ ca n't provide any source for ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ radical claims MONEY 's ridiculous . 
8452	1858	The only reason doctor costs are so high is because of the idiots that try to sue the hospital every time something natural happens . 
8453	1858	The people -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- ing are n't the ones paying . 
8454	1858	ING 's quite typical . 
8455	1858	Socialized healthcare is so great ... not . 
8456	1858	What 's a treatable disease some poor person typically dies from ? 
8457	1858	There is n't any . 
8458	1858	That 's the whole point of insurance , ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ know to insure ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ from being in the position to choose between outrageous prices and not getting the healthcare . 
8459	1858	DISEASE 's the same way for anything else . 
8460	1858	If I do n't buy home insurance and I house burns down ... what happens ? 
8461	1858	Everyone should be entitled to basic health care like they already are , but to suggest that everyone needs to go to doctor for a routine cold on taxpayers money is asinine . 
8462	1859	Absolutely wrong . 
8463	1859	If ASPECT_JTHORP24_ health insurance wo n't cover INSURANCE , and ASPECT_JTHORP24_ do n't have the money , many , many diseases will not get treated , and ASPECT_JTHORP24_ get to die . 
8464	1859	While it is true that if ASPECT_JTHORP24_ are without insurance ASPECT_JTHORP24_ can go to an emergency room for treatment , that does n't mean ASPECT_JTHORP24_ can automatically get whatever treatment is necessary . 
8465	1859	ROOM does n't mean ASPECT_JTHORP24_ get a kidney transplant if ASPECT_JTHORP24_ ca n't afford one . 
8466	1859	People die in America for lack of insurance . 
8467	1859	People die in America from lack of access to medical care . 
8468	1859	America has the best health care money can buy . 
8469	1859	But not if ASPECT_JTHORP24_ ca n't buy AMERICA . 
8470	1861	Still provided no sources other than ASPECT_SFJEFF_ own opinion . 
8471	1863	Tell that to 150000 innocent dead Iraqis . 
8472	1863	LOL ASPECT_JOLLEE_ wish Jollee . 
8473	1864	How do ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ know ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ figures are correct ? 
8474	1864	In fact how do ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ know they were all innocent ? 
8475	1864	I did not approve of Iraq 2 , but I did not have the information that the authorities did either -LRB- for the reason to go to war -RRB- . 
8476	1864	Oh I am sure the numbers of dead are high . 
8477	1864	However , ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ seem to have the need to be so one sided on the issue . 
8478	1864	Hey I am just wondering , how many people did Saddam and Saddam SADDAM torture and kill in the underground chambers ? 
8479	1864	I suppose Megadeath ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ condone that ? 
8480	1864	Truly I do not think that ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ condone Saddam 's torturous reign , correct ? 
8481	1864	Then would ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ not agree that REIGN was a good thing our brave soldiers ended up getting rid of SADDAM and at least hundreds of his secret death squad police ? 
8482	1864	Do n't ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ understand that the USA is not the only country that makes moral mistakes ? 
8483	1864	For example , is ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ country free of killing innocents ? 
8484	1864	What about the treatment of the Aboriginals ? 
8485	1864	On this and other threads ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ seem fixated on belittling the USA and her people but turn a blind eye to ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ own countries atrocities eh ? 
8486	1864	Hey take a stick or a crow bar and pry that other eye open ! 
8487	1864	ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ are missing so much stuff ! 
8488	1864	Oh for further reading of the other side of a soiled Australian coin ~ Racist Australia - Genocidal Atrocities Overviewhttp : \/ \/ www.treatyrepublic.net\/node\/66Maybe if OVERVIEWHTTP own countries atrocities are exposed OVERVIEWHTTP will shut up about our countries mistakes , God knows OUR all make mistakes , well most of OUR do ~ ? 
8490	1866	ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ poll is missing `` depends `` as in , ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ vote will depend upon the candidates ... ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ am not particularly happy with Obama , but the GOP will have to put up an `` electable '' candidate to get my vote . 
8491	1866	MY would vote for Obama over Sarah Palin , but Mitt Romney MY would consider . 
8492	1866	Anyone that would vote for the GOP or any political party without considering the candidates that are running is letting others make up OTHERS mind . 
8493	1866	MY would love to see someone like Ron Paul to get a real chance . 
8494	1866	MY admit SOMEONE is a little rigid in SOMEONE beliefs , and CANDIDATES are not necessarily popular with a lot of people . 
8495	1866	But if ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ listen to SOMEONE , SOMEONE logic is sound . 
8496	1868	LOL ASPECT_JTHORP24_ claim I do n't provide sources then ASPECT_JTHORP24_ make this rediculious claim that the entire reason healthcare costs are high is because of legal costs . 
8497	1868	That 's absolutely ridiculous . 
8498	1868	And I will cite this one : http:\/\/washingtonindependent.com\/634...pending-by-0-2The cbo estimated that only .5 &#37; savings would come out of tort reform . 
8499	1868	And .2 of that .5 % would come from people being less likely to use medical services . 
8500	1868	In other words because of the fact that Tort reform has already passed in most states , a nationwide tort reform would do next to nothing in terms of healthcare savings . 
8501	1868	Are ASPECT_JTHORP24_ really this daft ? 
8502	1868	People die from treatable cancers all the time because PEOPLE do n't have the insurance to cover regular checkups . 
8503	1868	Sure ASPECT_JTHORP24_ can go to the emergency room after ASPECT_JTHORP24_ 're pissing blood . 
8504	1868	But by then ASPECT_JTHORP24_ 're already dead . 
8506	1868	And if ASPECT_JTHORP24_ job lets ASPECT_JTHORP24_ go because ASPECT_JTHORP24_ have cancer and ca n't work anymore and ASPECT_JTHORP24_ lose ASPECT_JTHORP24_ employers healthcare good luck getting a new insurance plan . 
8507	1868	Basic healthcare is the ability to get regular checkups . 
8508	1868	And no CHECKUPS do n't have that for all Americans . 
8509	1868	Only those who can afford THAT . 
8510	1868	And regular checkups save lives . 
8511	1868	ASPECT_JTHORP24_ can not simply go to the emergency room and expect to survive . 
8512	1868	And if ASPECT_JTHORP24_ do ASPECT_JTHORP24_ have just put ASPECT_JTHORP24_ family into tens of thousands of debt . 
8513	1868	If we had universal healthcare that would n't happen . 
8514	1868	Why do ASPECT_JTHORP24_ think people in countries with universal healthcare live longer than WE and have better birth rates than WE ? 
8515	1868	ASPECT_JTHORP24_ do n't think it 's sad that the richest country on earth has the worst healthcare of any developed nation ? 
8516	1868	Or are ASPECT_JTHORP24_ one of those idiots that just closes PEOPLE eyes and pretends because WE are America that means WE are number 1 . 
8517	1869	Seriously why should my money go to protecting people who wo n't even pay a few extra dollars to see everyone have free on delivery healthcare without insurance bull -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- . 
8518	1869	Sad when people defend the profits of corporations over the basic health and safety of Americans . 
8519	1869	MY do n't even understand the mindset . 
8520	1869	Especially when in the end SYSTEM 's a cheaper system for America . 
8521	1869	PEOPLE 'd rather have more money in PEOPLE pockets than a more healthy country . 
8522	1869	And these are the so called patriots . 
8523	1871	ASPECT_SFJEFF_ cite liberal biased sources , that reinforce the liberal policy . 
8524	1871	Cite a source like the AMA . 
8525	1871	ASPECT_SFJEFF_ say things like between 2000 and 2006 17,700 uninsured people died with preventable diseases . 
8526	1871	Did ASPECT_SFJEFF_ die because ASPECT_SFJEFF_ had no insurance ? 
8527	1871	NO , ASPECT_SFJEFF_ died because ASPECT_SFJEFF_ did not do check ups , did not take care of ASPECT_SFJEFF_ . 
8528	1871	ASPECT_SFJEFF_ and the liberal idiots will say that 's because IDIOTS had no insurance , that 's why IDIOTS did not get check up 's . 
8529	1871	Here is a simple fact , not an opinion , that even liberals should be capable of understanding . 
8530	1871	FACT costs MORE to have insurance to pay for check ups than FACT would to pay for check ups on our own . 
8531	1871	Insurance IS a for profit business . 
8532	1871	IF A did not charge more in premiums than A pay out , A would not be able to pay for anyone 's care for anything . 
8533	1871	And the insurance companies profits are regulated by politicians . 
8534	1871	So obamacare changes nothing there except trade state politicians for federal politicians . 
8535	1871	And ASPECT_SFJEFF_ wanna bet the state politicians keep POLITICIANS expensive jobs while a whole new set of federal politicians and bureaucrats come on the scene and PAYROLL . 
8536	1871	And the people that died for the own lack of caring for POLITICIANS , COULD have gone to PEOPLE COUNTY HEALTH SERVICE -LRB- an already in place Govt health care plan -RRB- for regular medical care . 
8537	1871	PEOPLE would have paid for routine care according to PEOPLE individual ability to pay Again obamacare does no change here just adds a layer of costs to already existing programs long in place . 
8538	1872	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ do n't pay tax money . 
8539	1872	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ are on a bridge card . 
8540	1872	I do n't want to hear ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ talk about tax money . 
8541	1872	If ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ are on government assistance ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ do n't have a right to -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- about where tax money is going . 
8542	1873	ASPECT_DAN40_ Think the cbo is a liberal biased source . 
8543	1873	Which demonstates ASPECT_DAN40_ inability to determine what is and is not liberally biased . 
8544	1873	To ASPECT_DAN40_ anything that disagrees with the republican world view is a liberal source . 
8545	1873	Link please . 
8546	1873	And VIEW can continue to be even after universal healthcare . 
8547	1873	There are profitable insurance companies in Europe and Canada . 
8548	1873	Then that 's just prove that the for profit healthcare system is broken . 
8549	1873	Which is why universal healthcare would be better . 
8550	1873	Those services are far too few and far too spread apart to make a real dent in healthcare costs . 
8551	1873	THING forces insurance companies to take in preexisting conditions . 
8552	1873	That 's a good thing . 
8553	1873	And if THING puts insurance companies out of business then so be THING . 
8554	1873	Government could be doing COMPANIES job better anyway like JOB does in every other developed country . 
8555	1874	I pay hundreds of dollars a year in taxes . 
8556	1874	ASPECT_JTHORP24_ do n't know what ASPECT_JTHORP24_ 're talking about . 
8557	1874	The way I see YEAR anyone who -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- es about paying taxes should n't have a right to use the services paid for by taxes . 
8558	1874	Get off I roads . 
8559	1874	Quit calling the cops . 
8560	1874	And do n't expect the firemen to put out ASPECT_JTHORP24_ fires and do n't send ASPECT_JTHORP24_ kids to public schools . 
8561	1874	In fact why do n't ASPECT_JTHORP24_ just go to some remote island and start ASPECT_JTHORP24_ own tax free nation . 
8562	1876	ANYONE who buys into the ABSOLUTE illogical nonsense that high insurance premiums -LRB- true -RRB- will be cured by vastly increasing insurance coverage is certifiable . 
8563	1876	NONSENSE just WILL NOT come to pass . 
8564	1876	obummercare will turn out to be the most massive increase in health care AND insurance costs in history , if not repealed by rational thinking people . 
8566	1877	ASPECT_JTHORP24_ do n't like the offer I made ASPECT_JTHORP24_ , jthorpe ? 
8567	1877	Why ever not ? 
8568	1877	ASPECT_JTHORP24_ would n't have to pay for all those lazy parasites out there . 
8569	1877	This is just so typical . 
8570	1877	The people who complain the loudest about paying taxes do n't think twice about using what those taxes pay for . 
8571	1877	Tell I , who are the real parasites here ? 
8572	1877	I wonder how many tea partiers get social security benefits ? 
8573	1877	Face LOUDEST , jthorpe , ASPECT_JTHORP24_ make use of what the government does for us the same as everyone else . 
8574	1877	Quit whining and try acting like a responsible adult . 
8575	1878	`` how many tea partiers get social security benefits ? 
8576	1878	`` ANSWER : NONE , that have not paid FICA taxes for a minimum of 40 quarters -LRB- 10 years -RRB- and have attained the age of 62 years for partial payments or now 68 or so years for full benefits . 
8577	1878	A better question : How many parasites are receiving food stamps , housing subsidies , welfare , ADC , WIC , Medicaid , and tax rebates , when PARTIERS have not paid a cent of taxes in years . 
8578	1878	Maybe in PARTIERS whole lives ? 
8579	1880	Here xxxxxx is some research for ASPECT_SFJEFF_ . 
8580	1880	Sorry ASPECT_SFJEFF_ are unwilling or unable to find the truth . 
8581	1880	The woman with cancer , 1 . 
8582	1880	That is one side of the story . 
8583	1880	And 2 . 
8584	1880	No matter , the policy had to be within 2 years of issue or the insurer was stuck with POLICY . 
8585	1880	HIPAAHIPAA is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 . 
8586	1880	PORTABILITY limits insurers power to deny or delay claims , reduces ASPECT_SFJEFF_ chances of losing existing coverage , makes PORTABILITY easier and less risky to switch health plans , and prohibits insurance discrimination based on health problems . 
8587	1880	Key HIPAA Protections \* Non-Discrimination In a group plan , the insurer may not apply different eligibility rules , offer different benefits , or charge a higher premium to any individual on the basis of certain health factors health status , claims experience , medical history or genetic information . 
8588	1880	\* Guaranteed Issue Insurers providing small group coverage must offer coverage to any small employer that applies , regardless of health status or prior claims experience of the employees . 
8589	1880	\* Guaranteed Renewability Insurers may not cancel a health plan unless the beneficiary fails to pay the premiums or the insurer stops doing business in the market . 
8590	1880	\* Limits on Preexisting Condition Exclusions Insurers may not exclude -LRB- refuse to cover -RRB- treatments and services related to medical conditions that existed before the beneficiary purchased the health plan for a period ofmore than 12 months . 
8591	1880	If the person has had continuous coverage prior to purchasing the new plan there can be no coverage exclusions . 
8592	1880	State Consumer ProtectionsStates provide a variety of important protections through state law . 
8593	1880	These may include : the appeal of coverage decisions within the insurance company ; the appeal of coverage decisions to an impartial external reviewer ; prompt payment of claims ; access to certain specialists and health care providers ; coverage of specific treatments and services ; and many more . 
8594	1880	Every state has an insurance department that is ready to help ASPECT_SFJEFF_ with any question or complaint ASPECT_SFJEFF_ may have about ASPECT_SFJEFF_ coverage . 
8595	1880	To find out more , contact ASPECT_SFJEFF_ state insurance department . 
8596	1880	KNOWLEDGE IS POWER , WEAKLING 're a weakling . 
8597	1881	That 's just swell , until the person loses THAT job and then with health care coverage with JOB and ca n't find new employment with health coverage until the pre-existing limitations period expires . 
8598	1882	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ do know that health insurance can be purchased independently from ASPECT_IRIEMON_ employer , right ? 
8599	1883	They now have rights to continue coverage under Cobra . 
8600	1883	But someone who just lost THEY job ca n't often afford the Cobra insurance rates , which are usually mulitples higher than what MULITPLES paid when employer because the employer often pays for some or all of it . 
8601	1883	So THEY lose THEY insurance , and if THEY do n't get replacement insurance within a short period of time THEY can get screwed by the pre-existing . 
8602	1884	No , ASPECT_IRIEMON_ buy ASPECT_IRIEMON_ own insurance and opt out of ASPECT_IRIEMON_ employer 's plan . 
8603	1884	That way ASPECT_IRIEMON_ keep ASPECT_IRIEMON_ insurance before , during , and after ASPECT_IRIEMON_ employment . 
8604	1884	Once the Republicans dismantle Obamacare and allow insurance policies to be marketed across state lines , bringing in competition to the mix , then rates will fall . 
8605	1884	Be patient ... 
8606	1886	Actually , allowing insurance companies to sell across state lines would have the opposite effect . 
8607	1886	Because the health insurance companies will all do the exact same thing the credit card companies have done - move to the state with the least regulations and fewest consumer protections . 
8608	1886	Considering that some states place \* no \* restrictions at all on policy premiums or rate increases , somehow I doubt NO 're going to reduce NO rates out of the goodness of NO hearts . 
8609	1887	Wonderful idea . 
8610	1887	For that small percentage who lose their job and still can afford to pay for insurance on THEIR own . 
8611	1887	Everyone else is screwed . 
8612	1887	Republicans had 6 years of complete control of the Govt and did n't do -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- , except cut taxes which help folks who do n't need YEARS . 
8613	1888	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ pay hundreds of dollars of taxes ? 
8614	1888	I 'm not talking about sales tax . 
8615	1888	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ have stated that ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ only work during the summer because ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ ca n't handle working and going to college during the school year . 
8616	1888	I remember last summer ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ were complaining that ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ could n't find a job ... which is BS . 
8617	1888	So , ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ are n't paying hundreds of dollars in taxes . 
8618	1888	People who pay taxes can -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- all ONES want about ONES . 
8619	1888	ONES are the ones paying for ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ food because ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ are too lazy to work and ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ a moocher so ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ wo n't take out a small loan . 
8620	1888	Why do n't ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ stop mooching off the taxpayer and then we will listen to ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ ideas . 
8621	1888	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ have talked about how ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ can buy steak with ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ bridge card which is a freaking joke . 
8622	1888	People like ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ are the ones hurting the economy . 
8624	1889	Why do n't ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ listen to Obama . 
8625	1889	OBAMA has now admitted the health care bill is n't reducing anything . 
8626	1889	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ ca n't insure more people and have the total price go down . 
8627	1889	That is common sense . 
8628	1889	PRICE was just another liberal lie about health care ... get over PRICE ! 
8629	1891	But if the overall cost goes up marginally less the per capita costs decrease . 
8630	1891	Plus ASPECT_JTHORP24_ do n't have the cost of relying on emergency rooms for primary care . 
8631	1892	A lot of folks seem to think big fonts make more impressive arguments . 
8632	1892	Really smart ones put LOT in color . 
8633	1893	Health care is not a right . 
8634	1893	4 % unemployment , strong GDP growth , and a deficit that is a third of what UNEMPLOYMENT is now . 
8635	1893	Ahh , the good old days ... before Obama drove America into a ditch . 
8636	1894	It is if we make IT one . 
8637	1894	Should be , IMO . 
8638	1894	Some of WE would n't call -7 % growth `` strong '' . 
8639	1895	-LRB- covers my ears -RRB- MY goodness , jthorpe , shouting at the top of ASPECT_JTHORP24_ lungs has made ASPECT_JTHORP24_ argument ever so much more credible . 
8640	1895	GOODNESS makes ASPECT_JTHORP24_ sound so calm , rational , and well informed . 
8641	1895	And GOODNESS 'll make everyone not notice that ASPECT_JTHORP24_ provided no evidence or references , did not actually address anything MY said , and what ASPECT_JTHORP24_ did say is incoherent , and does n't actually work out to be a criticism of the health care law at all . 
8642	1895	Of course the total amount spent on health care has n't gone down . 
8643	1895	No one ever said ONE would . 
8644	1895	Have ASPECT_JTHORP24_ not been paying attention at all ? 
8645	1895	As MY said , the health care law was aimed primarily at expanding coverage and reforming insurance regulation . 
8646	1895	LAW has several measures aimed at improving efficiency in the health care system and works to shift the focus of treatment away from expensive specialists and toward preventive care and general practitioners , all of which should help contain costs in the long run . 
8647	1895	But cost containment is not and was never said to be the main intent . 
8648	1895	There are also several pilot programs in the law to explore ways to contain costs , but there are no easy answers . 
8649	1895	Besides , with a growing population , and rising costs far in excess of inflation , POPULATION would be virtually impossible to actually reduce the total costs . 
8650	1896	No , health care is not a right . 
8651	1896	Neither is having food . 
8652	1896	Would that make NEITHER okay to let people starve when ASPECT_JLB_ could easily help PEOPLE ? 
8653	1896	Obama has significantly improved the unemployment and GDP levels . 
8654	1896	As crappy as things are , PEOPLE 'd be a lot worse without the stimulus . 
8655	1896	We 've discussed that at length earlier in this thread . 
8656	1896	And yes , Dan , that is an opinion . 
8657	1896	An opinion strongly supported by evidence and shared by most economists . 
8658	1896	And ASPECT_JLB_ opinion that OPINION has n't helped still has absolutely no support of any kind whatsoever . 
8659	1896	Bush took us from a surplus to a recurring , structural deficit during a time of prosperity mainly for the sake of giving the wealthiest Americans large tax breaks . 
8660	1896	Obama came into office in the middle of the worst recession since the Great Depression , and ran up a deficit with one time stimulus measures to prevent the economy from collapsing completely . 
8661	1896	Plus , a large portion of the current deficit is simply due to lower tax revenues because of the bad economy . 
8662	1896	Once the economy recovers and the stimulus money is spent , Obama 's contribution to the deficit will almost completely disappear . 
8663	1896	Deficit spending during a national emergency -LRB- such as a severe recession -RRB- is a good thing , a necessary thing . 
8664	1896	THING 's like using ASPECT_JLB_ credit card to get through a temporary rough financial patch . 
8665	1896	Running up a recurring deficit during prosperity is just plain irresponsible . 
8666	1897	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ have a right to purchase health care . 
8667	1897	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ just want everything given to ASPECT_IRIEMON_ . 
8668	1897	Man up . 
8669	1897	Well I hope ASPECT_IRIEMON_ learned ASPECT_IRIEMON_ lesson after seeing what happened when ASPECT_IRIEMON_ voted for a Democrat House and Senate . 
8670	1897	They drove our economy into a ditch . 
8671	1898	Not if it meant that everyone had to starve and share the misery . 
8672	1898	He did ? 
8674	1898	Unemployment Nobody believes the failed stimulus worked , except maybe Joe Biden , because nobody has changed BIDEN talking points lately . 
8675	1898	Obama tripled that deficit and racked more debt in 1 1\/2 years than every other President that came before OBAMA , combined . 
8676	1898	All Americans who paid taxes got a tax break , btw . 
8677	1898	Obama is about to double the tax rate on the poor . 
8678	1898	Lower taxes = higher revenue to the Treasury . 
8679	1898	That tired old Keynesian argument has now been debunked . 
8680	1898	When ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ are in a hole , stop digging . 
8681	1898	Obama 's recurring deficit is going to last decades unless OBAMA and OBAMA band of economic halfwits are stopped . 
8682	1898	Luckily , that is about to happen , just in the nick of time . 
8683	1900	Why would ASPECT_JLB_ say that ? 
8684	1900	Is making baseless assertions and conclusions on something ASPECT_JLB_ know absolutely nothing about the norm for ASPECT_JLB_ ? 
8685	1900	NOTHING shows . 
8686	1900	The economy was a canyon before the Republican administration left town . 
8687	1901	Economists agree : Stimulus created nearly 3 million jobshttp : \/ \/ www.usatoday.com\/money\/econom...lus30_CV_N.htm The deficit decreased in Obama 's first full fiscal year . 
8688	1901	How many recent Republican presidents can say that ? 
8690	1901	Conservative myth . 
8691	1901	Millions paid taxes and did n't get a dime in tax breaks from the Bush tax cuts . 
8692	1901	Year - Revenues2000 2025.22001 1991.22002 1853.22003 1782.32004 1880.1 Source : CBO . 
8693	1901	govJust look at those higher revenues with the Bush tax cuts . 
8694	1901	Debunked by whom ? 
8695	1901	By what ? 
8696	1901	The Republicans re-instituting Bush administration policies ? 
8697	1901	Because they worked so swell last time ? 
8698	1902	Since ASPECT_JLB_ seemed to have completely missed the extensive discussion on the subject , CRUMBLING will repeat CRUMBLING main post on the subject : In March 2009 , only a month after the stimulus passed , the National Association of Business Economists conducted an industry survey in which 10.3 % of economists forecast a strong impact on the economy , 60.3 % a modest impact , and 29.4 % little to no impact . 
8699	1902	http:\/\/www.nabe.com\/graphweek\/2009\/gw090329.htmlAround a year after the stimulus was passed , studies done by IHS Global Insight , Macroeconomic Advisers and Moody s Economy.com all estimated that the stimulus created 1.6 million to 1.8 million jobs to date and that STIMULUS ultimate impact will be roughly 2.5 million jobs . 
8700	1902	http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/02\/17\/bu...leonhardt.htmlThe Congressional Budget Office estimated that the effects of the stimulus in the last quarter of 2009 were 2.1 million jobs created , GDP boosted by 3.5 % , and unemployment improved by 2.1 % ECONOMISTS estimate for the first quarter of 2010 is 2.8 million jobs and 4.2 % GDP . 
8701	1902	Unfortunately CRUMBLING had to rely on Wikipedia for these numbers http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stimulu..._under_the_Act because the PDF 's on the CBO 's website are n't working for CRUMBLING . 
8702	1902	http:\/\/www.cbo.gov\/Even Ben Stein , as conservative an economist as ASPECT_JLB_ could wish for and certainly no fan of the Obama administration , implies in an article discussing the failure of Lehman Brothers that the stimulus and bailouts were both necessary and at least somewhat effective . 
8703	1902	`` But the losses to the economy following the failure of Lehman have been on the order of hundreds of billions , maybe trillions . 
8704	1902	Certainly the rescue and stimulus packages needed in the wake of the Lehman failure have amounted to the trillions . '' 
8705	1902	While CRUMBLING certainly ca n't speak for Mr Stein , CRUMBLING would imagine STEIN would argue that the stimulus money could have been better spent to much more effect , but that 's not the same as saying that the stimulus has had no effect at all or even made things worse . 
8706	1902	http:\/\/spectator.org\/archives\/2010\/0...-of-depressionIn any case , $ 288 billion of the stimulus , 37 % of the total , went to tax breaks of various kinds . 
8707	1902	Are HTTP:\/\/SPECTATOR.ORG\/ARCHIVES\/2010\/0...-OF-DEPRESSIONIN going to argue that tax cuts do n't stimulate the economy , onalandline ? 
8708	1902	Basically , ECONOMY comes down to this . 
8709	1902	Are THIS going to deny that we were on the brink of another great depression ? 
8710	1902	Are THIS going to deny that WE 've moved back from the brink since then ? 
8711	1902	ASPECT_JLB_ can argue exactly how much the stimulus helped the economy , and ASPECT_JLB_ can certainly make the case that the money could have been spent more effectively . 
8712	1902	But if ASPECT_JLB_ want to say that the stimulus had no effect at all , CRUMBLING 'm afraid ASPECT_JLB_ 're going to have to back that up with something fairly substantial . 
8713	1902	Maybe the economy would have stopped short of the brink on ECONOMY own , and maybe ECONOMY would n't have . 
8714	1902	Do ASPECT_JLB_ really think we should have taken that risk and done nothing ? 
8715	1902	and once again WE come back to the simple question , which is preferable , 10 % unemployment , or 25 % ? 
8716	1902	Yes , the current deficits are history-making and record-breaking . 
8717	1902	Because the recession is history-making and record-breaking . 
8718	1902	Most of the increase in the deficit under Obama has been due to the recession , either directly to the lost tax revenue caused by dropping GDP or to the various stimulus and bailout measures to combat the recession . 
8719	1902	ASPECT_JLB_ do n't worry about water conservation when ASPECT_JLB_ house is on fire , even if ASPECT_JLB_ 're in the middle of a drought . 
8720	1902	Obama has said that once the economy recovers OBAMA will reduce the deficit and work on balancing the budget , and considering that so far OBAMA has mostly done exactly what OBAMA 's said OBAMA 'll do , CRUMBLING 'm going to give OBAMA the time to make good on the promise . 
8721	1902	If OBAMA does n't , CRUMBLING promise CRUMBLING 'll be as mad at OBAMA as ASPECT_JLB_ are . 
8722	1902	Even putting the direct effects on the economy aside , the infrastructure spending in the Stimulus Bill is something we desperately need . 
8723	1902	The US has been neglecting US infrastructure since the 70 's , and US 's starting to catch up with WE . 
8724	1902	Remember the bridge collapse in Minneapolis in 2007 ? 
8725	1902	Remember the New Orleans levies failing during Katrina ? 
8726	1902	Remember the Northeast Blackout of 2003 ? 
8727	1902	These are tastes of things to come if we do n't start dealing with the problem . 
8728	1902	And if WE infrastructure disintegrates , the economy wo n't be far behind . 
8729	1902	For a more detailed discussion of the issue , CRUMBLING would recommend the History Channel 's excellent documentary , `` The Crumbling of America . '' 
8730	1902	As CRUMBLING just said in another thread : That is a sufficiently misleading statement as to qualify as a lie in CRUMBLING book . 
8731	1902	Unless there 's a recession , tax revenues pretty much always go up , regardless . 
8732	1902	But so do expenditures . 
8733	1902	If ASPECT_JLB_ set the tax rate to zero , ASPECT_JLB_ obviously get zero revenues . 
8734	1902	So the blanket statement that lowering taxes always increases revenues is patently false . 
8735	1902	Lowering taxes has two effects . 
8736	1902	TWO decreases the rate of taxes paid , which tends to decrease revenues . 
8737	1902	And TWO stimulates the economy , which enlarges the tax base , which tends to increase revenues . 
8738	1902	When tax rates are very high , the economic stimulus effect predominates . 
8739	1902	When taxes are very low , the decreased rates predominate . 
8740	1902	There 's a curve , with peak revenues somewhere in the middle . 
8741	1902	The question is which side of the curve we 're on right now ? 
8742	1902	Considering that current US tax rates are really very low , both by historical US standards and compared to other industrialized countries , and considering that Bush 's tax cuts clearly created a large deficit , CRUMBLING think the answer is fairly obvious . 
8743	1902	Then why has TAX been used by Presidents of both parties and all philosophies in every economic downtown since the Great Depression ? 
8744	1902	Keynesian economics have been debunked ? 
8747	1902	By whom ? 
8748	1902	Creating an ideological rationalization about why something that worked really did n't does n't change the reality of the situation . 
8749	1902	Speaking of ideology , it seems awfully convenient that ASPECT_JLB_ seems to think that all ills can be cured with the same medicine - ASPECT_JLB_ not having to pay taxes . 
8750	1902	Where did this mad notion that the deficit is somehow equivalent to a bad economy come from , anyway ? 
8751	1902	That makes no sense . 
8752	1902	The relationship between the deficit and the economy is complex , and ca n't be whittled down to a simple one to one correspondence . 
8753	1902	In some circumstances a deficit can help the economy , in others hurt DEFICIT , and DEFICIT still others have no appreciable effect at all . 
8754	1902	On what basis do ASPECT_JLB_ claim that Obama has created any recurring deficit at all , or that DEFICIT will last decades ? 
8755	1902	Most of the increase of the deficit under Obama have been due to falling revenues caused by the recession , and stimulus measures . 
8756	1902	The stimulus is \* not \* a recurring expense , STIMULUS has an end date . 
8757	1902	Name one thing in the stimulus that does n't . 
8758	1903	Kes or Kessy is fine , Dan . 
8759	1903	And as PRAGMATIST 've said \* many \* times before , PRAGMATIST 'm a pragmatist - PRAGMATIST 'm entirely convincible on almost anything , and do n't particularly \* want \* to believe anything in most cases . 
8760	1903	And PRAGMATIST never hold onto a position when the evidence is clearly against PRAGMATIST . 
8761	1903	If ASPECT_DAN40_ want PRAGMATIST to agree with ASPECT_DAN40_ , then show PRAGMATIST . 
8762	1903	Show PRAGMATIST ASPECT_DAN40_ facts , ASPECT_DAN40_ evidence , a coherent argument , heck , anything at all . 
8763	1903	PRAGMATIST will listen , and change PRAGMATIST mind if what ASPECT_DAN40_ show PRAGMATIST stacks up . 
8764	1903	PRAGMATIST do n't believe in ideology . 
8765	1903	\*\* Any \*\* ideology . 
8766	1903	Beliefs are a bad thing , we should never have anything stronger then opinions . 
8767	1903	And as for the health care law - sources ? 
8768	1904	NAIC.ORG National Association of Insurance CommissionersA Govt body , as non partisan as anything gets . 
8769	1904	That 's one . 
8770	1904	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ state insurance commissioner would be another . 
8771	1904	REPUBLICAN should not have to tell ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ this . 
8772	1904	Searching for truth ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ 'd find SEARCHING on ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ own . 
8773	1904	Searching to prove REPUBLICAN wrong will lead ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ to partisan websites that are meaningless for ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ or I. REPUBLICAN 'm not a Republican , REPUBLICAN 'm a realist . 
8774	1904	Liberals are right when LIBERALS say Bush was bad . 
8775	1904	LIBERALS 're are wrong when LIBERALS say obummer is good . 
8776	1904	LIBERALS are both bad . 
8777	1904	And spending is the worst problem each made worse , and not listening to EACH public is the second worst problem each had\/has . 
8778	1905	Thse Keynesians were dead wrong . 
8779	1905	as we now know . 
8780	1905	Dead link . 
8781	1905	Nope , they said saved or created , which as WE all know is total BS . 
8782	1905	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ can not quantifu a job saved . 
8783	1905	Yet GDP is in the toilet . 
8784	1905	Yet unemployment is still around 10 % and has n't moved . 
8785	1905	Reality seems to be different than the guesses of the liberal Keynesians who made these bogus predictions . 
8786	1905	-LRB- quote -RRB- Their estimate for the first quarter of 2010 is 2.8 million jobs and 4.2 % GDP . 
8787	1905	Unfortunately I had to rely on Wikipedia for these numbers http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stimulu..._under_the_Act because the PDF 's on the CBO 's website are n't working for I . 
8788	1905	http:\/\/www.cbo.gov\/\/\/quote]Well THEIR work or HTTP:\/\/WWW.CBO.GOV\/\/\/QUOTE]WELL , and the estimate for GDP is a paltry .7 % on the low side and 2.7 % on the high side . 
8789	1905	In other words , a failure . 
8790	1905	In 2012 the numbers get even worse , with .2 % on the low side and .7 % on the high side . 
8791	1905	http:\/\/www.cbo.gov\/ftpdocs\/117xx\/doc...08-24-ARRA.pdf Here is what Ben Stein said : Another dead link ... Yes , the Democrat mishandling of the Housing Crisis could have been avoided . 
8792	1905	We are worse off now than if WE had done nothing . 
8793	1905	NOW did more harm than good . 
8794	1905	5 % , like WE had under Bush before the Democrats took over Congress . 
8795	1906	continued ... The current deficits are due to a waste of over a trillion dollars that should have been rebated back to tax payers , not paid out as pork and political favors to unions that did nothing to help the economy . 
8796	1906	Less than $ 100 billion went to infrastructure . 
8797	1906	Obama just admitted that there were no `` shovel ready jobs '' . 
8798	1906	That was all a lie . 
8799	1906	And I corrected ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ on that thread . 
8800	1906	Keynesianism prolonged the Great Depression , and has led to a lost decade in Japan , as they tried exactly the failed policies that Obama is trying now . 
8801	1906	Keynesianism will now take KEYNESIANISM 's place next to Marx on the dustbin of history . 
8802	1906	I already pay far more than I fair share of taxes . 
8803	1906	SHARE 's awfully convenient that ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ ideology consists entirely of stealing more from the productive in order to subsidize the nonproductive . 
8804	1906	Obama campaigned against deficits , right befre OBAMA created the largest deficits in the nations history . 
8805	1906	Where do ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ think the money to pay for all OBAMA pork has come from ? 
8806	1906	MONEY is all borrowed money , mortgaged on the backs of our children . 
8807	1906	The stimulus is wasteful spending . 
8808	1906	STIMULUS did nothing , and that money has to be paid back . 
8809	1906	STIMULUS will take 10-20 years t do STIMULUS , so STIMULUS is all recurring n the books every year . 
8810	1907	Convienient of ASPECT_JTHORP24_ to exclude sales tax , service taxes , social security taxes and medicare taxes just so ASPECT_JTHORP24_ can tell me ME have no rights as an American . 
8811	1907	Guess what buddy ? 
8812	1907	GUESS does n't matter what ASPECT_JTHORP24_ think . 
8813	1907	ME pay taxes just like everyone else in this country . 
8814	1907	And in the peak of ME post graduate career ME 'll probably be in one of the highest tax brackets . 
8815	1907	And ME hope by the time ME get there that ME tax rate is somewhere around 50 % . 
8816	1907	Because that 's a sensible rate for the top tax bracket . 
8817	1908	Whatever ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ say . 
8818	1908	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ are already moving towards the republican side ... ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ know ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ are voting for Snyder . 
8819	1908	There 's no such thing as a 50 % sensible tax rate . 
8820	1908	That will make ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ sick if THING ever happens . 
8821	1908	Why do n't ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ make a little promise to ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ that even if ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ are n't taxed that much , ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ donate the difference . 
8822	1908	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ can show ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ true patriotism then . 
8823	1908	Also , I do n't consider PATRIOTISM paying taxes when ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ take more from the government than ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ give in . 
8824	1909	My reply was rebutting Megadeaths smartass answers and statements running down MY people and country -LRB- USA -RRB- in a hypocritical manner for most part . 
8825	1909	All countries have skeletons in PEOPLE closets and that was what MY was addressing -LRB- while taking a shot at deaths credibility and agenda . 
8827	1909	Australia is one of the few countries left that MY would like to visit . 
8829	1911	How have I been hypocritical ? 
8830	1911	I have merely put ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ in ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ place when ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ go on and on about the USA being the greatest , which USA isnt . 
8831	1913	USA today ? 
8832	1913	Isnt that the paper originally purchased by the moonies . 
8833	1913	or the loonies ? 
8834	1913	Anyway ISNT 's a liberal propaganda vehicle that has just enough credibility to seem , well credible to the average uninformed American . 
8835	1913	A better name for the piece of tpaper -LRB- IMO -RRB- would be ` Comrades Of The Workers Party . 
8836	1913	De Rugy on the Big Lie of 3 Million Stimulus Jobs - Hit & Run ... Jul 14 , 2010 ... De Rugy on the Big Lie of 3 Million Stimulus Jobs ... Half a million jobs created means that 2.5 million were saved !! 
8837	1913	Why , just imagine ... if ... The U.S. Office of Strategic Services described Hitler 's psychological profile as follows : ... Liberal Ignoramushttp : \/ \/ reason.com\/blog\/2010\/07\/14\/de...ig-lie-of-3-miNOBama is a cur and a cancer upon the free -LRB- not if NObama has NOBAMA way -RRB- American people . 
8839	1914	I can pretty much edit out the partisan political rhetoric , especially when RHETORIC 's blatantly wrong or false . 
8840	1914	I 'm NOT voting for Obama but then again , I 'm NOT voting for any of the current front running republicans either . 
8841	1914	For a fair assessment of the Obama record , go to this site . 
8842	1914	http:\/\/www.politifact.com\/truth-o-meter\/ and check out the Obamameter . 
8843	1914	This country either need to abolish both parties or needs a clearly different third party . 
8844	1916	Not at all . 
8845	1916	I have given credit where it is due heaps of times . 
8846	1916	Not at all , I jsut point out how ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ are far worse . 
8847	1916	Why not ? 
8848	1916	LOL Yeah sure , that 's why ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ have always resorted to attacks on I rather than I arguments near the end . 
8850	1916	When I actually pose a counter argument , then , and maybe then , ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ will have engaged in a debate . 
8851	1916	SO far I have just smashed everyone of ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ pompous and ignorant assertions . 
8852	1918	Ok , well I have pointed out previously that Australian Aboriginal history is quite shocking , a nd our subservience to British and then American alliances was ridiculous . 
8853	1918	In terms of the US I have pointed out ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ low standard of living for ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ status economically , ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ low level of health , social security , education and happiness , areas in which Australia surpasses ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ . 
8854	1918	What has the US done well ? 
8855	1918	Well it was the first society to create true liberal democratic principles that lasted effectively . 
8856	1918	SOCIETY also has provided much stability for certain areas of the world . 
8857	1918	In this international sense however I have shown how they have out THEY interests firsts and have often acted rather immorally . 
8858	1918	I have not said the US is -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- or evil all I have said is what happened . 
8859	1918	If ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ cant hack the truth , well then TRUTH just sucks to be ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ and I ca n't help ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ . 
8860	1918	See above , ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ are wrong , again . 
8861	1919	JLB did n't leave , he was banned for predicting that Hillary would sell out and take a position with the Obama Administration . 
8862	1919	ASPECT_FRODLY_ touted Obama , and now ASPECT_FRODLY_ are realizing what a mistake ASPECT_FRODLY_ made as OBAMA has failed miserably , just as I foretold . 
8863	1919	Let 's hope ASPECT_FRODLY_ are smart enough to have learned ASPECT_FRODLY_ lesson . 
8864	1920	Yep , that 4 % unemployment and high GDP growth was terrible . 
8865	1921	High GDP growth ? 
8866	1921	Are ASPECT_JLB_ kidding me ? 
8867	1921	GW 's best year was bested by 6 years during the Clinton administration . 
8868	1921	GW 's average annual growth was the worst of any president since Hoover , including Carter by a long shot . 
8869	1921	`` High GDP growth . '' 
8870	1921	HIGH 's just amazing what ASPECT_JLB_ guys will say . 
8871	1922	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ mean two economists agree , right ? 
8872	1922	From ASPECT_IRIEMON_ link : Not everyone is convinced . 
8873	1922	`` TAYLOR ca n't find in TAYLOR analysis that the 2009 stimulus package had much effect at all , '' says economist John Taylor of Stanford University . 
8874	1922	Taylor , who served as undersecretary of the Treasury under former president George W. Bush , says the recovery that began last year stemmed from a pickup in business investment unrelated to government spending . 
8875	1922	TAYLOR dismissed the Zandi-Blinder conclusions as divorced from what is actually occurring in the economy and reflecting built-in assumptions about the impact of government spending . 
8876	1922	Not even ASPECT_IRIEMON_ believe that lie . 
8877	1922	All who paid income taxes got a tax break . 
8878	1922	When the Democrats allowed Bush Tax Cuts to expire , they doubled the tax rate on the poor . 
8879	1922	The Bush Tax Cuts did n't becme effective until 2002 and 2004 , and golly gee , revenues rise after that on ASPECT_IRIEMON_ source . 
8880	1922	Current events . 
8881	1922	Instituting proven conservative principals over economics will save us from the destruction of the left wing halfwits running the show now . 
8882	1923	Was it higher than IT is now , since Dims took over Congress and drove our economy into a ditch ? 
8883	1923	Check out the horrible record on GDP the Dims have . 
8884	1923	Check out the Dims record on unemployment . 
8885	1923	Now look at what has happened to the debt since they took over Congress . 
8886	1923	NOW 's a shameful record . 
8887	1923	Luckily , America is about take the keys away from THEY , and put the grownups back in charge . 
8888	1924	That 's all BIDEN need . 
8889	1924	BIDEN 've proved ASPECT_JLB_ statement : `` Nobody believes the failed stimulus worked , except maybe Joe Biden '' is false . 
8890	1924	The USA Today article speaks for ARTICLE as to the consensus of economists who agree that Govt intervention prevented a depression . 
8891	1924	Not even ASPECT_JLB_ believe that lie . 
8892	1924	BIDEN do n't expect people to rely on BIDEN for facts . 
8893	1924	Anyone can see the decrease in the budget deficit PEOPLE here : http:\/\/cbo.gov\/ftpdocs\/119xx\/doc11936\/SeptemberMBR.pdf Page 1 . 
8894	1924	As to the fact that Reagan , Bush and Bush all increased the deficits in PEOPLE first full fiscal year in office , the data is here :1982 under Reagan deficit increased from 73.9 to 120.6 billion1990 under Bush deficit increased from 205.4 to 277.6 billion2002 under Bush deficit increased from 32.4 to 317.4 billionAs to who is telling lies , the record is self evident . 
8895	1924	Folks can decide for FOLKS . 
8896	1924	That is now correct , correcting ASPECT_JLB_ prior erroneous statement . 
8897	1924	NOW has n't expired . 
8898	1924	But ASPECT_JLB_ claim is false or misleading . 
8899	1924	Rates did n't double . 
8900	1924	Some will have to pay taxes that did n't . 
8901	1924	Current events . 
8902	1924	To the contrary . 
8903	1924	BIDEN figured ASPECT_JLB_ assertion was basely . 
8904	1924	Conservatives economics make sense only if ASPECT_JLB_ suspend reality . 
8905	1925	Well sure , if ASPECT_JLB_ only give Obama the two years to make a comparison . 
8906	1925	Though if ASPECT_JLB_ really want to compare Democrats and Republicans on GDP growth , Dems blow them away . 
8907	1925	I trust our members can see that a fair comparison would be over at least one term . 
8908	1925	Especially as Obama took office in the middle of the worst economy since the Great Depression . 
8909	1925	Average real GDP growth under Bush was the worst of every president who served a full term since Hoover . 
8910	1925	Ford was a little worse , be BUSH only was in half a term . 
8911	1925	Only the partisan ideologue would claim that Bush had `` high GDP growth '' 
8912	1926	That article is old , and before the disaster of the stimulus failure was clear to all . 
8913	1926	That 's a good thing , as FACT-FREE are 100 &#37; fact-free . 
8914	1926	Obama was President in 2009 , when ASPECT_IRIEMON_ link says this the deficit was the highest in history . 
8915	1926	PRESIDENT is als the President now , with the second highest deficit in history , thanks t PRESIDENT failed programs . 
8916	1926	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ ca n't get a tax break if ASPECT_IRIEMON_ do n't pay taxes . 
8917	1926	That should be self evident , and for ASPECT_IRIEMON_ to assumepeople who did n't pay taxes should have gotten one just shows ASPECT_IRIEMON_ lack of understanding . 
8918	1926	The Congress , by one vote , chose not to extend the Bush Tax Cuts that will expire on Jan 1 , 2011 . 
8919	1926	Thus the Democrats are responsible for the largest tax increase in our country 's history , to go along with their other records of highest deficits , highest debt , etc. There will be a 50 % tax increase for the poor because of the Democrats . 
8920	1926	I corrected I to tax revenues rose after the tax cuts . 
8921	1926	Where is the proof that things are better ? 
8922	1926	Is the UE rate lower ? 
8923	1926	Where are the jobs ? 
8924	1926	Suspending reality is what makes ASPECT_IRIEMON_ a liberal . 
8925	1927	The Democrat Congress is responsible for the destruction of the economy that started in 2006 . 
8926	1927	Obama was a part f that , and OBAMA compounded the problem when OBAMA took office by taking money out of the economy to spend on pork 'n unions . 
8927	1928	Aug 30 2010 is `` old '' ? 
8928	1928	Here 's something more recent for ASPECT_JLB_ : Did the Stimulus Create Jobs ? 
8929	1928	Yes , the stimulus legislation increased employment , despite false Republican claims to the contrary . 
8930	1928	http:\/\/www.factcheck.org\/2010\/09\/did...s-create-jobs\/ ASPECT_JLB_ unsubstantiated say so does n't impress me . 
8931	1928	Maybe HTTP:\/\/WWW.FACTCHECK.ORG\/2010\/09\/DID...S-CREATE-JOBS\/ impresses others . 
8932	1928	So was Bush . 
8933	1928	And so was Bush when the 2009 budget was enacted . 
8934	1928	Millions paid FICA taxes and got no tax break from the Bush administration whatsoever . 
8935	1928	Bush did n't cut taxes the working poor pay . 
8936	1928	We can only hope . 
8937	1928	WE need to undo the Bush administration 's policies which got WE into this mess . 
8938	1928	So instead of paying $ 1 they pay $ 1.50 . 
8941	1928	Once THEY stopped cutting taxes , revenues rose with inflation and GDP and stocks . 
8942	1928	Proportionally THEY never caught up , and that was the single biggest reason for the $ 5 trillion Bush ran up after inheriting a surplus budget . 
8943	1928	The economy was tanking at -7 % real and losing 700,000 jobs a month and the stock markets were crashing . 
8944	1928	Not the economy is growing , the private sector has created jobs for 9 straight months , and the stock market is up 65-70 % since March 2009 . 
8945	1928	We are not out of the deep hole the recession put WE in , but WE are n't getting deeper , in stark contrast to the picture in the first quarter 2009 . 
8946	1928	Not enough demand as people and businesses pay down debt . 
8947	1928	Can ASPECT_JLB_ image the situation if the stimulus had not been passed ? 
8948	1928	Yet ME 'm the one supporting ME assertions with citations and data . 
8949	1928	ASPECT_JLB_ 're the one relying on unsupported blather . 
8950	1928	Which is being shown erroneous . 
8951	1929	Unsupported partisan nonsense . 
8952	1929	The Democrats were a minority party with little power to do anything when the destruction of the economy started in 2006 . 
8953	1929	Which actually had started well before that as the Govt sat by while frenzied speculation in the real estate market coupled with unregulated lending procedures created a bubble that had maxed out in 2006 . 
8954	1930	The government sat by ... ASPECT_IRIEMON_ mean Barney Frank , Chris Dodd , and Barack Obama sat by ... hmmm ? 
8955	1932	The Democrats did not control the congress agenda or the administration of the Govt . 
8956	1932	That was the Republicans and Bush promoting BUSH `` ownership society '' agenda . 
8957	1932	Most Dems did vote in favor of the \* only \* bill ever passed by either house during the entire time Republicans controlled congress which passed in 2005 . 
8958	1932	And went nowhere because of opposition by the WH . 
8960	1934	Not gonna happen . 
8961	1934	Keep dreamin . 
8962	1935	ASPECT_JLB_ avatar says `` undefeated '' . 
8963	1935	What a strange think to have in light of these posts :9 -17 -2008 9-15-08 9-15-08 9-13-08 Maybe ASPECT_JLB_ mean `` undefeated '' in ring toss or something . 
8964	1935	Certainly not in political posts here at PF . 
8965	1936	That is a complete and total lie , and shows a profound lack of even the slightest understanding of economics . 
8966	1936	The economic collapse was the result of a housing bubble that burst . 
8967	1936	That problem was brought about by a number of different poor decisions , starting MUCH earlier than 2006 . 
8968	1936	The blame lies quite clearly with Republicans , but also with the Fed , Democrats , the Banks , and other groups as well . 
8969	1936	Anyone with even a passing understanding of economics realizes that the economic collapse has roots that go back to way before 2006 , and only mentally deficient partisan hacks believe the problems started in 2006 -LRB- actually 2007 -RRB- when the Democratic congress came to power . 
8970	1936	If Democrats are to blame in any way -LRB- HACKS certainly share some of the blame -RRB- , HACKS contributions go back the late 90s WAY more than HACKS do 2006 -LRB- actually 2007 -RRB- . 
8971	1937	Fairly good post . 
8972	1937	If ASPECT_FRODLY_ just changed this sentence : `` The blame lies quite clearly with Republicans , but also with the Fed , Democrats , the Banks , and other groups as well . 
8973	1937	`` To read : The blame lies quite clearly with politicians of both parties , but also with the Fed , The Banks , and other groups as well . 
8974	1937	Then ASPECT_FRODLY_ would be in total agreement with ASPECT_FRODLY_ . 
8975	1940	I agree with Dan on this one . 
8976	1941	What we need is a party in power that will limit government and bring it back to IT Constitutional obligations . 
8977	1941	The closest thing WE got going are the Tea Party Conservatives running as Republicans . 
8978	1942	This should be short ... No , there is no evidence to back ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ up , only speculation . 
8979	1942	An estimate is not evidence . 
8980	1942	The current unemployment rate is not 9.2 % , RATE is 9.6 % , so there goes ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ argument . 
8981	1942	Gee , I wonder which party Mark Zandi -LRB- yes , ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ spelled RATE wrong ... -RRB- gives ZANDI money to ? 
8982	1942	ZANDI , MARKMALVERN , PA 19355 MOODY 'S \/ ECONOMIST 6\/23\/08 $ 2,300 Roggio , Robert -LRB- D -RRB- ZANDI , MARKMALVERN , PA 19355 MOODYS ECONOMY.COM\/CHIEF ECONOMIST 5\/18\/09 $ 1,000 Specter , Arlen -LRB- D -RRB- ZANDI , MARK MMALVERN , PA 19355 MOODY 'S ECONOMY.COM\/CHIEF ECONOMIST 9\/16\/09 $ 2,400 Sestak , Joseph A Jr -LRB- D -RRB- ZANDI , MARK MMALVERN , PA 19355 MOODY 'S ECONOMY.COM\/CHIEF ECONOMIST 3\/31\/09 $ 2,400 Sestak , Joseph A Jr -LRB- D -RRB- ZANDI , MARK MMALVERN , PA 19355 MOODY 'S ECONOMY.COM\/CHIEF ECONOMIST 3\/31\/09 $ 2,400 Sestak , Joseph A Jr -LRB- D -RRB- ZANDI , MARK MMALVERN , PA 19355 MOODY 'S ECONOMY.COM\/CHIEF ECONOMIST 6\/24\/07 $ 2,300 Sestak , Joe -LRB- D -RRB- ZANDI , MARK MMALVERN , PA 19355 MOODY 'S ECONOMY.COM\/CHIEF ECONOMIST 6\/26\/07 $ 2,300 Sestak , Joe -LRB- D -RRB- Nothing but left wing nut jobs ... Wow , so ZANDI endorses the Republican position that tax cuts are the best way to get the economy going ... This economy would n't be stuck in a ditch if we would have let the people keep PEOPLE $ 1 trillion in tax cuts rather than Obama wasting MARKMALVERN . 
8983	1942	The BEA is a laughingstockThe original BEA 2008Q3 GDP announcement of -0.5 % later downward revised to -2.7 % ! 
8984	1942	Shortly thereafter 2008Q4 was announced at -3.8 % and the BEA later did a downward revision to -5.4 % . 
8985	1942	PEOPLE never get BEA right . 
8986	1942	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ let the census worker trick fool ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ , eh ? 
8987	1942	No , NO 's getting worse and NO could have been much better . 
8988	1942	Here is a nice list for ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ to start on . 
8989	1942	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ have very little understanding of economics , which is why ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ are so gullible for the failed policies of the left . 
8990	1942	The bottom line : The `` stimulus '' cost nearly a trillion dollars . 
8991	1942	Taking $ 1 trillion away from the private sector where money always flows to LINE 's best possible use , and using SECTOR in a bloated command economy model is inefficient at best , a disaster at worse . 
8992	1942	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ are merely pulling that number out of ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ rump . 
8993	1942	Sure NUMBER has ... Bwahahaha ! 
8994	1942	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ think ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ are the one teaching the lesson here ? 
8995	1942	I have forgotten more about economics than ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ will ever learn . 
8996	1942	There is nothing ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ can teach I . 
8997	1942	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ ignorance is boundless , which makes ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ a great follower of Zero . 
8998	1942	YouTube - Greatest movie line ever ! 
8999	1944	LOL That was funny . 
9000	1945	I have no problem following ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ infantile reasoning . 
9001	1945	I 've been working in the investment management business studying economics I entire life . 
9002	1945	I know what works in the real world . 
9003	1945	No , NO are not , especially when NO are wrong by many degrees of magnitude , and have to be constantly corrected . 
9004	1945	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ keep living in ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ dream world , and I will keep intruding with reality . 
9005	1945	So ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ admit ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ resources that ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ place ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ leftist faith in are flawed and unreliable ... I will stick to reality and history . 
9006	1945	FAITH is n't better , but ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ are pulling those numbers out of the air . 
9007	1945	We will soon see 10.3 % , however , thanks to Obama 's policies . 
9008	1945	Gallup : Next unemployment report will be worseMonday , October 18 , 2010 2:54:29 PM Unemployment , as measured by Gallup without seasonal adjustment , is at 10.0 % in mid-October essentially the same as the 10.1 % at the end of September but up sharply from 9.4 % in mid-September and 9.3 % at the end of August . 
9009	1945	This mid-month measurement confirms the late September surge in joblessness that should be reflected by the government s Nov. 5 unemployment report . 
9010	1945	Is 10 % better , or worse than 9.6 % ? 
9011	1945	Take ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ time ... A recession is two consecutive negative quarters of GDP growth , so we could have a double dip , and probably will unless Obama is stopped . 
9012	1945	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ used that arbitrary number as if to say that if Obama had not wasted $ 1 trillion on the stimulus WE would have 25 % unemployment . 
9013	1945	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ do n't know how bad STIMULUS would have gotten without the wasted money . 
9014	1945	STIMULUS probably would have gotten better , an we would not have mortgaged WE children 's future on liberal pork to unions . 
9015	1945	Recessions can happen due to war , and any number of other factors . 
9016	1945	Conservatism ends recessions . 
9017	1945	Liberalism prolongs recessions . 
9018	1945	Government wasteful spending is by far the worst way to stimulate the economy . 
9019	1945	Obama has never had a real job , nor have most of OBAMA economics team , and they pretend to know how to better spend people 's money than taxpayers do . 
9020	1945	Worse unemployment . 
9021	1945	Higher debt . 
9022	1945	Higher deficits . 
9023	1945	That is the record of ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ brand of economics . 
9024	1945	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ know RECORD , and so does the rest of America now . 
9025	1945	That is why America is taking the keys away in 336 hours . 
9026	1946	I know ... 
9027	1949	The recession ended 6 months after Barack Obama was elected . 
9028	1949	How much faster do ASPECT_SHAKER154_ expect a president to act ?! 
9029	1950	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ ca n't claim a recession or depression ended until years after the fact . 
9030	1950	Things are still getting worse , RECESSION 's not even over yet . 
9031	1951	ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ Kool-Aid must be 100 proof these days ! 
9032	1952	How do ASPECT_DAN40_ define `` recession '' ? 
9033	1953	It is over a year after the fact . 
9034	1953	The recession ended June 2009 . 
9035	1953	We know for a fact the recession ended then . 
9036	1953	If the economy starts to shrink again then that would be another recession entirely . 
9037	1953	Though I do n't know where ASPECT_JTHORP24_ get that things are getting worse ... the economy is continuing to grow , though not as fast as people would like . 
9038	1953	However MATTER 's only a matter of time till jobs start coming back . 
9039	1953	Companies are reporting record numbers of cash on hand . 
9040	1953	COMPANIES just need more assurance that this is a stable economy that is n't going to crash again . 
9041	1953	And more and more we are seeing that slowly but surely the economy is stabilizing ECONOMY . 
9042	1953	MATTER 's only a matter of time now . 
9043	1954	In whatever way makes Obama look bad . 
9044	1954	If by 2014 Obama is still president and we have 4.5 &#37; unemployment OBAMA 'll be saying WE 're in a recession because there are still people who are unemployed . 
9045	1954	Or WE 're about to enter a recession . 
9046	1954	One of those . 
9047	1954	Republicans WE 're saying WE are about to enter a recession all throughout the 90s . 
9048	1954	The recession never did happen all the way up until 2007 . 
9049	1954	Turns out Clinton 's policies kept WE recession free for 15 years . 
9050	1955	I 'm just curious if he asserts we are still in a recession , what definition HE is using and the source for HE definition . 
9051	1956	Actually , that 's not true , Bill . 
9052	1956	The US had a recession in 2000 - 2001 , caused largely by the tech bubble bursting . 
9053	1956	Let 's be honest here , folks , the economy is an enormous beast with a tremendous amount of inertia that tends to do as BEAST pleases . 
9054	1956	The government has only a limited ability to influence what GOVERNMENT does , and within the government the Federal Reserve has much more ability to effect the economy then the President and the Congress . 
9055	1956	There 's only so much \* any \* President can do , positive or negative . 
9056	1956	And for the umpteenth time , the economy right now is stagnant , not in recession . 
9057	1957	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ 've probably noticed , in real life , that `` stagnant '' has a certain unpleasant odor about STAGNANT . 
9058	1957	Do ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ know the difference between humor and odor ? 
9059	1957	Humor is a shift of wit ! 
9060	1957	Just tryin ' to lighten up . 
9061	1958	Good post , but there are recessions and then there are recessions . 
9062	1958	The 2001 `` Clinton recession '' as conservatives often call RECESSION was more like a slowdown . 
9063	1958	As GDP figures were ultimately calculated , GDP never went down in two consecutive quarters , which is the classic test of a recession , and in the worst year , FY2001 , real GDP increased 1.1 % , and actual GDP increased over 3 % . 
9064	1958	CLINTON know ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ did n't compare CONSERVATIVES , but the 2001 `` recession , '' if it is even fair to call 2001 a recession -LRB- CLINTON know the NBER classified NBER as such -RRB- was a much different beast that the recession Obama inherited . 
9065	1959	-LRB- giggles -RRB- Yes , DAN 're absolutely right , Dan . 
9066	1959	Stagnation sucks , big time . 
9067	1959	But recession sucks more . 
9068	1959	It 's like the difference between a wildfire that 's raging out of control and one that 's been contained but not put out . 
9069	1960	That 's cute . 
9070	1960	Though THAT am curious as to ASPECT_DAN40_ response to THAT question : How do ASPECT_DAN40_ define `` recession '' ? 
9071	1960	When ASPECT_DAN40_ accuse others of `` drinking koolaid '' THAT 'd expect ASPECT_DAN40_ could at least defend ASPECT_DAN40_ position as to the basis for that assertion . 
9072	1961	But it ` hai n't ' no way to get re-elected ! 
9073	1961	Do ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ know the difference between an epileptic oyster shucker and a prostitute with diarrhea ? 
9074	1961	The epileptic oyster shucker shucks between fits ! 
9075	1962	... ... `` ended '' ... ... so they say ... The job market is still bleak -LRB- but looking better -RRB- and we have tons of debt to china ... Government bond anyone ? 
9076	1962	WE need recovery , Just like BO needs vacations to recover 
9077	1964	Actually no there was no recession in 2000-2001 . 
9078	1964	A recession is 2 sequential quarters of economic shrinkage . 
9079	1964	There was never 2 quarters of shrinkage between 2000 and 2001 . 
9080	1964	So there was never a recession . 
9081	1964	Just a slowdown . 
9082	1965	Tsk , tsk , Bill . 
9083	1965	If ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ 're going to reproach others for presenting facts in a deceptive way , ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ really should n't do WAY ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ . 
9084	1965	US GDP fell in the first and third quarters of 2001 . 
9085	1965	Technically not a recession , but for all practical purposes TECHNICALLY was . 
9086	1965	TECHNICALLY was also a worldwide slowdown , and many other countries \* did \* meet OTHERS technical definitions of recession . 
9087	1965	Yes , it was a very mild recession , but do n't try to explain RECESSION away . 
9088	1965	RECESSION 's really not a good idea to hide behind technicalities . 
9089	1967	I stand by I claims . 
9090	1967	I asked ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ to provide quotes to back up ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ claims however they are non existent . 
9091	1967	I do not take ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ word for WORD pal , no offense meant I ask everyone to provide sources or quotes . 
9092	1967	Ok , onward ? 
9093	1967	Now ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ ask what has the United States done so well ? 
9094	1967	She is a super power and the world leader like POWER or not . 
9095	1967	That is not a arrogant statement , POWER is a statement of fact . 
9096	1967	SHE is a bastion of freedom and truly was at the forefront of saving the world from speaking German and Japanese . 
9097	1967	There is just too much to list . 
9098	1967	-LRB- \/ quote -RRB- And ? 
9099	1967	ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ say these things , and just in ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ gun control argument ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ cling to studies funded to say what ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ want to hear . 
9100	1967	Sorry that fails in debate . 
9101	1967	ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ first and second sentence why ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ entire idea about the USA is incorrect . 
9102	1967	If we had n't been all that I highly doubt ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ countries would exist . 
9103	1967	In WW2 if the USA had not of assisted ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ country WW2 would of been overrun for example . 
9104	1967	And FWI , ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ statement about the USA 's ` rather immoral ' behavior is another example another hypocritical statement , because other countries immoral behavior are often exceedingly worse than the USA 's . 
9105	1967	All countries sometimes act in ` rather immoral ' ways because that is what must governments do to ensure the continued existence of their host countries at times . 
9106	1967	However compared to other countries I would rather be an POW etc in the USA compared to almost any other country . 
9107	1967	If the USA was truly immoral I would n't say that . 
9108	1967	ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ have insinuated as much , which is worse because ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ can not man up enough to put what ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ mean in plain words . 
9109	1967	Ok , to the rest of the forum I apologize for zinging this far off topic , I will not comment on this with MD again unless we start a new thread . 
9111	1968	MAJORITY can tell ASPECT_IRIEMON_ Obama seems to be swilling Jim Jones koolaid like JONES name is Otis Campbell drinking Mayberrys finest hooch if OBAMA thinks OBAMA is going to be reelected . 
9112	1968	We have a terrible job market and MAJORITY can tell Obama that spending trillions here and trillions there has failed . 
9113	1968	The smoke and mirrors of the white house imaginary jobs is a pathetic attempt to save Obamas butt . 
9114	1968	However read MAJORITY lips , Obama is gone in 2013 . 
9115	1968	And , that 's all MAJORITY have to say about that , except that MAJORITY am exceedingly happy the majority of Americans even a goodly number of the original jaded Obama lovers have seen the golden boys color fade from gold to OBAMA true color ; pewter gray . 
9116	1968	For a time MAJORITY thought MAJORITY fellow Americans had lost leave of their senses nearly worshiping the Harvard ` professor ' -LRB- a misnomer really -RRB- . 
9117	1968	God does indeed work in mysterious ways . 
9118	1968	Byeee Obama ! 
9120	1970	do n't worry . 
9121	1970	End of the world is n't till dec 2012 . 
9122	1970	So Obama will have time to be reelected . 
9124	1971	Not like it 's going to happen anyways . 
9125	1971	Keep dreamin ' . 
9126	1972	Ha ha yes ! 
9127	1972	Still I think that out of all the weird stuff the 2012 prediction of something happening is the most credible . 
9128	1972	Maybe Obama and -LRB- whoever the GOP musters against OBAMA -RRB- will be the least of our worries . 
9130	1973	Ha ha I did say 2013 ! 
9131	1973	man HA wayyyy too early ! 
9132	1973	Nov of 2012 is the date to remember eh ? 
9133	1973	Hey that will be a squeaker . 
9135	1975	Technical definitions are all we have to determine what is and what is n't a recession . 
9136	1975	I 'd rather follow the technical definition then tell everyone a lie . 
9137	1975	There was no recession between 2000 and 2001 . 
9138	1975	Saying anything else is telling a lie . 
9139	1975	Just the same as saying we are in a recession now is telling a lie . 
9140	1975	Recession has a specific definition . 
9141	1976	OK technocrat , the economy went through a down cycle in 2000-2001 and is in a much deeper , and longer , down cycle now . 
9142	1976	Try discussing ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ exact technical definitions with the 28 million unemployed and under employed . 
9143	1976	See if they give a dam about ASPECT_THETAOOFBILL_ technicalities ! 
9144	1977	There are millions of unemployed in even a perfect economy . 
9145	1977	Plus employment is a lagging indicator . 
9146	1977	INDICATOR might take a year or two after the economy stabilizes for businesses to feel comfortable hiring again . 
9147	1977	The problem with unemployment is PROBLEM 's not necessarily a problem with the economy . 
9148	1977	PROBLEM 's a problem with confidence . 
9149	1978	The hallmark of this liberal administration and the Kool-Ade drinking liberal groupies , EXCUSES . 
9150	1978	Never before in human history have so many excuses , been made so often , by by so few . 
9151	1978	That has a familiar sound !!! 
9152	1979	But I thought government ca n't create jobs . 
9153	1979	So what do ASPECT_DAN40_ want Obama to do exactly ? 
9154	1979	Oh wait . 
9155	1979	ASPECT_DAN40_ 're one of those people who said we should have done absolutely nothing at all . 
9156	1979	I wonder what sort of excuses ASPECT_DAN40_ would have given by now . 
9157	1980	There IS no PROOF that doing nothing would have made anything worse , just as there is no PROOF that the massive never ending flow of various Stimulus plans have accomplished anything but more debt . 
9158	1980	Of that and that alone , THERE IS PROOF ! 
9159	1980	And the Govt can create jobs . 
9160	1980	But they are only Govt jobs and thus are a burden on a vibrant economy rather than an impetus to the economy . 
9161	1981	ASPECT_DAN40_ ca n't mathematically prove anything in economics . 
9162	1981	But there is lots of evidence that the Stimulus has had a significant impact , as logic would tell ASPECT_DAN40_ STIMULUS would . 
9164	1982	Logic would tell us that ? 
9165	1982	Unemployment is still close to it 's peak . 
9166	1982	US spent $ 860 billion . 
9167	1982	Next to nothing has been done . 
9168	1982	Just wait until the effects of the wasted money . 
9169	1983	Logic would tell us if the Govt had n't pumped a few hundred billion in spending into the economy creating demand for jobs and paying for jobs for folks who would otherwise have been fired , unemployment would have gotten much higher and the recession would be worse . 
9170	1983	Conservatives tell US all the time that tax cuts spur economic growth , so if ASPECT_JTHORP24_ believe that , logic would tell ASPECT_JTHORP24_ that the hundreds of billions in tax cuts had an efffect as well and that the economy would have been worse and unemployment higher without ECONOMY . 
9171	1983	Finally , logic tells US from empirical data , including FDR 's new deal and WWII , that Govt spending stimulates the economy , and finally the fact that in this period the fact the economy went from tanking -7 &#37; real and losing 700,000 jobs a month to growing and the private sector adding jobs suggests the stimulus had a positive effect , as the bi-partisan and most economists agree . 
9172	1983	While $ 860 billion is a lot , I agree , and it is almost as much money wasted in the mistaken war in Iraq , comparatively MONEY represents just over 5 % of the economy . 
9173	1983	Given that both Govt spending and the deficit were cut in FY2010 , US should n't be surprised that this modest amount of stimulus , while logic and evidence suggest LOGIC helped turn the economy around and stop getting worse , was n't sufficiently large to really set AMOUNT on fire . 
9174	1983	Unfortunately , fiscal mismanagement by the prior three Republican administrations left the nation in such a precarious state of debt that only a limited amount of stimulus was prudent . 
9175	1984	Oh things have been done alright . 
9176	1984	Backward progress , increased government , bowing to the ME ... Plenty has been done my friend , plenty . 
9177	1985	Need I say more ? 
9178	1986	Well , since ASPECT_JTHORP24_ did n't actually say anything , my first instinct would be that in fact yes , yes ASPECT_JTHORP24_ do . 
9179	1987	I agree 100 &#37; . 
9180	1987	The problem with many activist radical liberals is that LIBERALS have no common sense . 
9181	1987	Hey I have a splendid idea ! 
9182	1987	Lets eat the activists . 
9184	1988	Common sense means to me something even an idiot would know . 
9185	1988	Which is why SOMETHING confuses the hell out of ME when conservatives say CONSERVATIVES want more common sense in government . 
9186	1988	Sorry but government policy is complicated . 
9187	1988	Economic policy is complicated . 
9188	1988	ME do n't want people with common sense in government . 
9189	1988	ME want people with uncommon sense in government . 
9190	1989	Right now we have people in power with : No common sense , No uncommon sense , No practical sense , Just nonsense . 
9191	1989	PEOPLE have consistently repeated that if enough money is spent and WE wait long enough , PEOPLE unproven theorems , will eventually work . 
9192	1989	If the Government HAD $ 4 or $ 5 trillion extra dollars laying around doing nothing , perhaps , and only perhaps , a case could be made for PEOPLE theorems . 
9193	1989	However when every cent the people in power are spending on Stimulus is BORROWED money with no end in sight or any method to pay END back , the theorems go out the window . 
9194	1989	The rescinding of the Bush tax cuts are not even an issue . 
9195	1989	PEOPLE WILL hurt the economy and PEOPLE WON `` T lower the debt a single penny . 
9196	1989	ECONOMY is all liberal window dressing and sleight of hand . 
9197	1990	$ 860 billion is now considered `` a few billion , '' to liberals now ? 
9198	1990	NOW 's really getting sad . 
9199	1990	People just do n't realize how much money that is . 
9200	1991	Not that much at all compared to the losses we would have endured . 
9201	1992	Oh please . 
9202	1992	Paying billions of dollars to save a few jobs . 
9203	1992	It 's getting quite comical . 
9204	1992	We have posted enough stories of loads of stimulus money creating jobs at the waste of taxpayer money . 
9205	1992	http:\/\/news.yahoo.com\/s\/yblog_upshot...eate-7-76-jobs$111 million to create 54 jobs ? 
9206	1992	That 's 2 million per job . 
9207	1992	2 million ! 
9208	1993	The obamalama claimed that the stimulus `` CREATED '' 50,000 NEW ` WINDFARM ' JOBS . 
9209	1993	The only problem is those generators were up and running BEFORE the obamalama became president . 
9210	1993	Another 50,000 jobs ` created ' in OBAMALAMA own mind . 
9211	1993	Even if the stimulus did create the 3.5 million jobs claimed , which nobody believes , including the liberal media . 
9212	1993	STIMULUS still comes to $ 232,571.43 , cost per job created . 
9213	1993	So with 14.8 million unemployed , we only need $ 3,442,057,164,000.00 more stimulus to achieve full employment . 
9214	1993	And WE great , great , great , great , great , great , grand kids can worry about the debt . 
9215	1995	The $ 232,000.00 is the cost of a Govt created job , not the salary . 
9216	1995	The private sector cost of creating a job is $ 31,000.00 , not the salary . 
9217	1996	lol wut ? 
9218	1996	Do ASPECT_DAN40_ just pull these numbers out of ASPECT_DAN40_ ass or something . 
9219	1996	Where the hell does 31,000 dollars per job in the private sector come from ? 
9220	1998	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ have been brainwashed into believing the Govt is the answer . 
9221	1998	The Govt is not only NOT the answer , GOVT is the problem . 
9222	1998	The recession is\/was wholly caused by the Govt meddling in the free market . 
9223	1998	Then the politicians BLAME the free market for all the problems the Govt caused . 
9224	1998	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ liberals scream about deregulation of the free market and clamor for more regulation . 
9225	1998	Well we had regulation , the Govt repealed many , very good , very effective regulations , in order to further THEMSELVES politically . 
9226	1998	Now a new financial regulation bill has been passed in great haste and in a completely partisan manner . 
9227	1998	ALREADY NOW is seen as ridiculous . 
9228	1998	The SEC was exempted from new regs . 
9229	1998	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ want Wall Street to toe the line and LIBERALS -LRB- liberals -RRB- exempt the SEC ? 
9230	1998	Even Barney Frank blanched at that . 
9231	1998	FRANK said that the bill was passed so quickly FRANK did n't have a copy to read . 
9232	1998	That is an absolute intentional LIE . 
9233	1998	And indicative of the problem of the Govt meddling where ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ are sadly incompetent , the free market . 
9234	1998	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ personally and liberals in general keep repeating that if the Govt had not WASTED well over a TRILLION dollars we 'd be in such bad shape . 
9235	1998	This is OPINION , NOT FACT . 
9236	1998	A fact is that many recession in the past have corrected ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ without any Govt intervention . 
9237	1998	would this have been another one to correct OPINION ? 
9238	1998	We will never know that because WE HAVE HAD massive intervention by the very same people that caused the recession . 
9239	1998	And the SEEDS of this recession were NOT planted by Bush or Republicans . 
9240	1998	The clock was running long before Bush , and both parties are equally to blame . 
9241	1998	The Stimulus did not and HAS not worked . 
9242	1998	Liberals can not grasp that simple FACT but the majority of the American is fully aware that obama HAS FAILED . 
9243	1998	And in addition to the failure , we now have more debt accumulating than any other president in history . 
9244	1998	Bush increased the debt by an average of $ 625 billion per year . 
9245	1998	obama IS increasing the debt by $ 1.5 TRILLION per year . 
9246	1998	And ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ liberals claim Bush was terrible . 
9247	1998	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ ARE right , Bush was terrible -LRB- and BUSH was `` the Govt . '' -RRB- 
9248	1998	and now obama is the Govt and BUSH is 2.4 times WORSE than Bush . 
9249	1998	Why does Freddie and Fannie now need ANOTHER $ 300 + BILLION to further bail LIBERALS out ? 
9250	1998	Because F&F invented , bought , and guaranteed the fictitious `` sub-prime '' loans . 
9251	1998	The free market did not invent those worthless loans , calling LIBERALS what LIBERALS are , F&F & `` THE GOVT did that for the good of all of us . 
9252	1998	Liberals scream about the ruthless crooks on Wall Street . 
9253	1998	TARP was passed in a DEMOCRAT Congress , and TARP bailed out , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , wait for CONGRESS , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , WALL STREET !! 
9254	1998	Would CONGRESS have been better if the Govt had stayed out of the free market ? 
9256	1998	If they HAD , maybe there would NOT have even been a recession . 
9257	1998	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ want proof that ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ 're drinking the liberal Kool-Ade and that the stimulus has failed ? 
9258	1998	Look to the politicians feeding ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ that Kool-Ade . 
9259	1998	Are POLITICIANS running for re-election on the merits of obamacare ? 
9261	1998	Are POLITICIANS running on the great jobs reports ? 
9263	1998	Are POLITICIANS running on the great Stimulus plan ? 
9265	1998	POLITICIANS campaigns are one thing and one thing only . 
9266	1998	F&F opponent is worse than F&F . 
9267	1998	NOT how much good F&F 've done , instead , F&F opponent will be even worse ! 
9268	1998	Ca n't ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ read between the lines of what ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ own liberal politicians are saying ? 
9269	1998	POLITICIANS 're saying , the pooch is screwed , and ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ ca n't hear POLITICIANS because ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ ears are full of the Kool-Ade . 
9270	1999	The only brain washing going on here has convinced ASPECT_DAN40_ that the fairy tales about the free market are in fact accurate . 
9271	1999	Government is not the answer to many problems , ASPECT_DAN40_ are right . 
9272	1999	Unfortunately for the narrative ASPECT_DAN40_ are trying to convince us of , government at other times actually IS the answer . 
9273	1999	No one believes government should solve all problems , or even most problems , that is a straw man invented the the believers in the laissez faire fairy tale . 
9274	1999	The reality is , government did play a role in the current economic crisis , but the reality is also that the market did as well . 
9275	1999	Government did keep interest rates too low , but BELIEVERS also deregulated the whole industry -LRB- that means less government , not more -RRB- , and the market failed . 
9276	1999	Banks did act incompetently . 
9277	1999	BELIEVERS did , when given more freedom , cause a massive problem . 
9278	1999	The same is true of consumers of housing . 
9279	1999	People bought houses PEOPLE could n't afford , not because government made PEOPLE , but because PEOPLE made irrational decisions . 
9280	1999	Irrational decisions are not taken into account in the laissez faire fairy tale story . 
9281	1999	Nor are market failures , externalities , etc. But that is the problem some of us are able to see the problems government solves and the problems PROBLEM creates . 
9282	1999	US do n't need a black and white world where X is the problem and Y is the solution . 
9283	1999	Not when the reality is that sometimes X IS a problem , but SOLUTION is also sometimes a solution . 
9284	1999	Just like Y is sometimes a solution , but SOLUTION can also be a problem as well . 
9285	1999	That is the reality of the market -LRB- I do n't call SOLUTION the free market , as that is a mythical concept made up in the laissez faire fairy tales . 
9286	1999	SOLUTION is sort of like a unicorn -RRB- , SOLUTION can do some things extraordinarily well , but can not do others things as well . 
9287	1999	Government is the same . 
9288	1999	But that takes a level of nuance and recognition of complexity that too many are incapable of recognizing . 
9289	1999	I really do tire of the simplistic arguments where either government is the source of all problems , or greedy corporations are the source of all problems . 
9290	1999	The reality is CORPORATIONS are both capable of doing good things as well as bad . 
9291	2000	No , just like I dont let I dog soil I carpet ... 
9292	2001	Is this meant to be a folksy home truth that offers some simple insight into the issue at hand ? 
9293	2001	If THIS is , please explain what in the world ASPECT_JOLLEE_ are talking about , because at the moment MOMENT makes no sense to me , and just seems like nonsensical gibberish . 
9294	2002	In other words , no I am not voting for I ! 
9296	2003	-LRB- giggles -RRB- PRAGMATIST ears are full of Kool-Ade ? 
9297	2003	Dan , PRAGMATIST think ASPECT_DAN40_ metaphor has kinda derailed here . 
9298	2003	Look , like PRAGMATIST 've said before , PRAGMATIST 'm a pragmatist - PRAGMATIST go with what works , and PRAGMATIST go where the evidence leads PRAGMATIST . 
9299	2003	If ASPECT_DAN40_ want to convince PRAGMATIST of ASPECT_DAN40_ position , then show PRAGMATIST evidence . 
9300	2003	Or a thorough argument . 
9301	2003	Or \* something \* that 's a reason to think that . 
9302	2003	Just saying that government is evil and always the problem over and over is n't going to cut PROBLEM , ASPECT_DAN40_ need to show how and why government is the problem . 
9303	2003	No one is saying that the market is evil or needs to be done away with or the source of nothing but problems . 
9304	2003	Well , at least not anyone with an ounce of sense . 
9305	2003	The free market is an extraordinarily powerful engine for creating material wealth . 
9306	2003	But that 's really all ENGINE does . 
9307	2003	As PRAGMATIST 've previously pointed out , the market left to PREVIOUSLY own devices can create some pretty bad situations . 
9308	2003	PREVIOUSLY needs to be balanced with other institutions . 
9309	2003	That does n't necessarily need to be government , but at least so far , government has been the most effective -LRB- if very imperfect -RRB- tool for doing that . 
9310	2003	If ASPECT_DAN40_ have a better suggestion , please share SUGGESTION . 
9311	2003	PRAGMATIST am not especially interested in laying blame for this recession . 
9312	2003	PRAGMATIST 'm much more interested in figuring out what to do \* now . 
9313	2003	\* PRAGMATIST agree completely that the seeds of this recession go way back , and many hands helped plant them . 
9314	2003	But that does n't help us find a way out of WAY now . 
9315	2003	As PRAGMATIST said before , fiscal stimulus is about the only tool available to the President and Congress to fight a recession . 
9316	2003	If ASPECT_DAN40_ have a suggestion for something else to try , please share that too . 
9317	2003	In general , PRAGMATIST believe in balanced budgets , and do n't like deficit spending . 
9318	2003	But there are times when deficits are both appropriate and necessary . 
9319	2003	Just like ASPECT_DAN40_ should generally keep ASPECT_DAN40_ family budget balanced , but sometimes ASPECT_DAN40_ need to borrow because of unusual circumstances . 
9320	2003	A family emergency , an accident or other unforeseen expense not covered by insurance , etc. . 
9321	2003	The comparison between Presidents Bush and Obama is not about how big their deficits are , but what THEIR 're being run up for . 
9322	2003	President Bush ran up a recurring structural deficit during a time of prosperity primarily to fund tax cuts for the top earners . 
9323	2003	This would be sort of like quitting ASPECT_DAN40_ well paying full time career and instead taking a part time job , without changing ASPECT_DAN40_ spending . 
9324	2003	President Obama , on the other hand , has run up a deficit with emergency , limited spending to deal with the current crisis . 
9325	2003	This is more analogous to if ASPECT_DAN40_ had a fire in ASPECT_DAN40_ house , and ASPECT_DAN40_ insurance did n't give ASPECT_DAN40_ enough coverage to fix everything , so ASPECT_DAN40_ take out a loan to get things back to how EARNERS should be . 
9326	2003	PRAGMATIST do n't like bailouts any more then ASPECT_DAN40_ do , but EARNERS are necessary . 
9327	2003	Just look at the damage letting Lehman Brothers fail caused . 
9328	2003	What would have happened if we 'd allowed , what was DAMAGE ? 
9329	2003	Something like a dozen major companies ? 
9330	2003	What if WE 'd let all of them fail at the same time ? 
9331	2003	Sometimes life does n't give ASPECT_DAN40_ any good options , and ASPECT_DAN40_ have to choose the least bad one . 
9332	2003	Surely ASPECT_DAN40_ ran into situations like that running ASPECT_DAN40_ business , when ASPECT_DAN40_ had to make a hard choice between the lesser of two evils ? 
9333	2003	Yes , the stimulus \* has \* worked , just not enough . 
9334	2003	We 've been over this at length already , do PRAGMATIST need to go over the CBO reports , unemployment and GDP figures , independent economic analyzes , surveys of economists , and all of that \* again \* ? 
9335	2003	This will be , what , the fourth time now ? 
9336	2003	Something like that . 
9337	2003	ASPECT_DAN40_ had no answer to all that evidence before , do ASPECT_DAN40_ have one now ? 
9338	2003	As for the way Democrats are running their campaigns this year , PRAGMATIST have to admit PRAGMATIST am completely mystified . 
9339	2003	But then political campaigns are often not governed by reason and facts ... 
9340	2004	I 'm not much for laying blame either . 
9341	2004	But in this case , the blame is on `` THE GOVT , '' the same people ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ hope will fix WHAT THEY BROKE ! 
9342	2004	Not Democrats , Not Republicans , not liberals , not conservatives -------- POLITICIANS of both parties caused our recession , unknowingly , and have no knowledge of how to fix -------- . 
9343	2004	Over and over , and over again , MY post like liberal OPINIONS ARE FACTS , OVER are not facts same as my posting are n't facts unless I can point to a proof . 
9344	2004	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ say Stimulus HAS worked , just not enough . 
9345	2004	That is FAILURE . 
9346	2004	That is the rewarding of the mediocre as liberals are wont to do . 
9347	2004	TRYING is just trying . 
9348	2004	DOING is accomplishment . 
9349	2004	What happens if this company fails or that company fails ? 
9350	2004	SOMETHING ELSE TAKES THEIR PLACE . 
9351	2004	That is the free market . 
9352	2004	obamalama said GM must not fail , Many of ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ ` esteemed ' economists said GM must not fail . 
9353	2004	GM did fail and is still an unconstitutional Government manufacturing company . 
9354	2004	In the process of becoming a Govt manufacturing co. , `` THE GOVT , '' violated long existing bankruptcy laws as MANY were inconvenient to the Govt . 
9355	2004	Bond holders got screwed , the taxpayer got screwed , and GM was GIFTED to the UAW in exchange for votes . 
9356	2004	And `` THE GOVT '' that ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ place SO much faith in , sweetened the pot for the UAW and GIFTED $ 60 BILLION in cash in addition to the bailout billions . 
9357	2004	Then this same wonderful GOVT claims that GM paid back all of the bailout . 
9358	2004	Yes BILLIONS did , BILLIONS paid GOVT back with part of the $ 60 billion in WORTHLESS STOCK `` THE GOVT '' purchased for GM . 
9359	2004	Stock presently worth $ 00.75 , IF STOCK were traded . 
9360	2004	AND THAT IS A FACT !! 
9361	2004	AND `` THE GOVT , '' GAVE Chrysler to FIAT . 
9362	2004	Someday we will learn why , other than somehow helping the UAW more . 
9363	2004	How much do ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ REFUSE to see ? 
9364	2004	There is much , much more . 
9365	2005	I would never buy a car that was Government owned , I wont give the reasons why ... But I think the Republic is smart enough to know ... 
9366	2006	Translation : JLB is far too smart for me . 
9367	2006	ME tried tangling with him , and HIM handed ME ME ass . 
9368	2006	ME intend to stay on the porch and not run with the big dogs , and ME suggest ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ do the same . 
9371	2009	Thanks for the input . 
9372	2011	ASPECT_LOPHOPHORA_ would , would n't ASPECT_LOPHOPHORA_ ? 
9373	2011	Or at least stop making predictions ... I guess some people never learn . 
9374	2012	Dan , breaking the economy and fixing ECONOMY are two different things . 
9375	2012	While what was done wrong to get us here is important to learn from in making decisions in the future , giving the economy a boost now \* is \* something US know how to do . 
9376	2012	Fiscal stimulus has been being used successfully by administrations of both parties since the Great Depression . 
9377	2012	And as I 've already shown , there is ample evidence that the stimulus \* has \* helped the economy . 
9378	2012	ASPECT_DAN40_ insist on clinging to the sliver of uncertainty inherent in everything in life just because ASPECT_DAN40_ do n't like where the evidence leads . 
9379	2012	That 's ASPECT_DAN40_ privilege , of course , but ASPECT_DAN40_ ca n't expect anyone else to pay attention to ASPECT_DAN40_ if that 's what ASPECT_DAN40_ choose to do . 
9380	2012	If ASPECT_DAN40_ hit a nail with a hammer , and the nail is only driven partway in , do ASPECT_DAN40_ declare the hammer a failure and toss HAMMER away , or do ASPECT_DAN40_ hit the nail again ? 
9381	2012	If \* one \* company is going under , then sure , let the market do MARKET thing , even if MARKET 's a really big one . 
9382	2012	But if there are a lot of large companies all going under at the same time ? 
9383	2012	As a thought experiment , consider the extreme case - if every company in the country failed at the same time . 
9384	2012	DISASTER would be a total disaster , right ? 
9385	2012	Each company that fails represents a hit to the economy . 
9386	2012	Individually , each failure is small enough that the economy as a whole can handle ECONOMY . 
9387	2012	But if ASPECT_DAN40_ get too much at one time , especially if the economy is already weak , TIME can cause a real problem . 
9388	2012	The economy is resilient and can take a lot of punishment , but there is a limit . 
9389	2014	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ present the `` Doomsday Scenario , '' and of course , the result would be Doomsday , SURPRISE . 
9390	2014	The idea of bailing out Wall Street WAS to ease the credit crunch . 
9391	2014	They took the money and kept MONEY and now report record profits , while not easing credit at all . 
9392	2014	How many would have failed ? 
9393	2014	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ DO NOT KNOW and DOOMSDAY do n't know and obamalama does n't know . 
9394	2014	But MONEY sure looks like crooked but not so smart politicians got hosed by crooked but smarter businessmen . 
9395	2015	I can see ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ ca n't stop thinking about I ... 
9396	2016	Burger King is hiring . 
9397	2016	That would suit ASPECT_FRODLY_ capacity very well . 
9398	2016	Be all that ASPECT_FRODLY_ can be . 
9399	2017	FIRMS only meant it as a thought experiment to point out that if a lot of large companies all fail at once , that would have larger implications beyond just those companies . 
9400	2017	Obviously FIRMS 'm not suggesting that there 's any possibility that every company in the country could actually fail at the same time , that 's a rather silly scenario if taken literally . 
9401	2017	No , nobody knows how many would have failed if the government had done nothing . 
9402	2017	But we do know that Lehman Brothers \* did \* fail , and THAT had major repercussions for the entire economy , and helped push WE into recession . 
9403	2017	And WE do know that quite a few large financial firms were also in trouble at the same time . 
9404	2017	Would SCENARIO really have been worth the risk to do nothing ? 
9405	2017	And FIRMS 'm no happier about the behavior of a lot of those firms after THOSE got the bailout money then ASPECT_DAN40_ are , but what can WE do ? 
9406	2017	Should Congress try to pass a law to make THOSE do the right thing ? 
9407	2017	Of course not , talk about government intruding on the market , and COURSE probably would n't work anyway . 
9408	2017	So the choice WE have is , do WE hold WE noses and help a bunch of undeserving schmucks solely because THOSE 've managed to worm THOSE way into important positions , or do WE let THOSE go down and take the risk THOSE 'll take the rest of down with THOSE ? 
9409	2017	Besides , a lot of the TARP money has been paid back , and FIRMS believe the program is actually expected to turn a nice profit for the taxpayer when all is said and done . 
9410	2017	As for the stimulus ... If each time ASPECT_DAN40_ hit the nail TIME 's driven in just a tiny bit , even if AMOUNT 's a microscopic amount , after a trillion hits ASPECT_DAN40_ 'll have moved the nail appreciably , even if TIME 's not been driven all the way home yet . 
9411	2017	Besides , what else are ASPECT_DAN40_ going to do if ASPECT_DAN40_ toss the hammer aside ? 
9412	2017	Try to drive in the nail with ASPECT_DAN40_ mind ? 
9413	2017	-LRB- j\/k -RRB- We 've gone from a major recession with a shrinking economy shedding jobs at a breathtaking rate to a stagnant economy with stable yet unacceptably high unemployment . 
9414	2017	That \* is \* progress , even if WE still have a long way to go yet . 
9415	2017	And there is plenty of evidence , as FIRMS 've shown , that the stimulus helped . 
9416	2017	When PLENTY comes to the campaign ... -LRB- shrugs -RRB- What can FIRMS say ? 
9417	2017	Democrats are a bunch of wimps ? 
9418	2017	FIRMS really do n't know what 's going on with them . 
9419	2017	FIRMS 've heard some talking heads on TV speculate that the people running the campaigns think that , `` FIRMS may be bad , but FIRMS would have been a lot worse if FIRMS 'd done nothing , '' is too complicated an argument to get across in a campaign . 
9420	2017	FIRMS 've no idea if PEOPLE had any idea what PEOPLE were talking about or not . 
9421	2017	It seems like the Democrats lost the spin war and just kinda gave up . 
9422	2017	Do n't ask FIRMS why . 
9423	2017	WAR seems to FIRMS -LRB- yes , this is purely FIRMS impression -RRB- that people are upset about the economy and scared for PEOPLE future . 
9424	2017	Which is , of course , completely understandable and justified . 
9425	2017	But a lot of times people who are scared and upset react more emotionally , maybe the Dems are afraid that people are too emotional right now to listen to facts and figures ? 
9426	2017	FIRMS really do n't know , FIRMS 'm purely speculating here . 
9427	2018	They have ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ thoroughly and completely brainwashed . 
9428	2018	The liberal party line , the public is confused , the public is scared , the public is emotional . 
9429	2018	And here ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ are , insulting us just like ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ masters do . 
9430	2018	US are not confused , US know what is going on . 
9431	2018	US are not afraid . 
9432	2018	US are a bit emotional , PISSED about being talked down to by an incompetent idiot whose strings are being pulled by Soros , pissed about being insulted , pissed about being told US do n't know what US 're doing , and pissed about the bastardization of the American Dream . 
9433	2018	And pissed about The Communist idea of `` redistribution of the wealth . '' 
9434	2018	And pissed about ruinous wasteful spending with NO plan to pay AND back . 
9435	2018	Pissed about a long string of lies , bribes , earmarks , and technicalities used to pass a health-care INSURANCE bill that up to 70 % of the nation does not want . 
9436	2018	So yes we are emotional to get this puppet clown out of power and then out of office . 
9437	2019	I 'm sorry if what I said sounded condescending or insulting , that was n't I intent at all . 
9438	2019	So please accept I apology , I retract what I said about IDEA . 
9439	2019	However , I do question whether IDEA 's a good idea to judge what 's going on in the real world based on what politicians say , especially politicians running for office . 
9440	2019	Wait a minute Dan , that almost sounds like ASPECT_DAN40_ 're complaining about the government \* not \* spending money . 
9441	2019	LOL Is n't LOL a good thing if THING took less money to deal with the problem then was originally thought ? 
9442	2019	I do n't know for sure how much , if any , of the bailout money has been paid back , and I do n't really want to argue about MUCH . 
9443	2019	-LRB- To be honest , I just do n't feel like doing the work to come up with hard numbers . -RRB- 
9444	2019	That 's not really the point . 
9445	2019	TARP was designed to keep the financial system from completely collapsing , which SYSTEM did . 
9446	2019	Do ASPECT_DAN40_ think liberals \* wanted \* to bail out Wall Street ? 
9447	2019	We had to do STREET because the danger of severe damage to the economy was too great . 
9448	2019	Besides , Dan , what would ASPECT_DAN40_ be saying now about the government 's incompetence if the bailouts had n't happened , and NOW had dropped the floor out from under the economy ? 
9449	2020	Once again , unrelentingly , ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ present opinions as facts . 
9450	2020	The floor DID drop out of the economy . 
9451	2020	Would FLOOR have been worse , OR NOT ? 
9452	2020	We do not know . 
9453	2020	But WE do know that the problems WERE caused by politicians . 
9454	2020	To push the politicians to the side and LET the FREE MARKET WORK , could have been the much wiser thing to do . 
9455	2020	But while there is no proof of that , neither is there any proof that letting the people that caused the problems continue to manipulate the free market to POLITICIANS own ends was wise either . 
9456	2020	WE ARE where WE are now . 
9457	2020	And the people in power now have had and do have but one single plan . 
9458	2020	BORROW MORE , SPEND MORE BORROWED MONEY ! 
9459	2020	Sorry that ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ are unable to realize that the majority of Americans do not agree with that `` plan . 
9460	2020	`` This from a liberal site :10 \/ 04\/2010The federal government &#8217; s unpopular &#8211; and often vilified &#8212; $ 700 billion bailout program officially came to an end when the clock struck midnight early Monday morning . 
9461	2020	The Troubled Asset Relief Program &#8217; s -LRB- TARP -RRB- formal sunset date means that no new programs will be funded under the initiative and no more money will be doled out to prop up ailing banks , although existing programs &#8211; such as the government &#8217; s foreclosure prevention efforts &#8211; will continue to run S course with the money that &#8217; s already been allotted . 
9462	2020	Capitalists , tax-paying Americans , and even lawmakers who voted for the bill that made TARP possible two yearsago to the day have criticized the government &#8217; s massive intervention in the financial system . 
9463	2020	Initially , this monumental rescue effort was expected to cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars &#8211; a figure that prompted outcries and protests across the nation . 
9464	2020	But with banks now turning a profit and repaying TAXPAYERS TARP dollars , and even the automakers and insurance giant AIG expected to be able to pay back at least part of TAXPAYERS capital injections , the program &#8217; s price tag has shrunk to a fraction of that . 
9465	2020	The latest reports on the Treasury &#8217; s estimates put the total cost of TARP at less than $ 50 billion . 
9466	2020	Some officials have even gone so far as to say OFFICIALS expect the government &#8217; s bailout efforts to actually turn a profit for taxpayers when all is said and done . 
9467	2020	Numbers released by the Congressional Budget Office -LRB- CBO -RRB- in August are not too far off from the Treasury &#8217; s figures . 
9468	2020	CBO &#8217; s assessment is that TARP will carry an expense of $ 66 billion . 
9469	2020	Treasury says $ 50 billion , CBO says $ 66 billion , liberal writer says , `` not too far off . '' 
9470	2020	Just $ 16,000,000,000.00 OFFTHEY-DON ` T-KNOW - WHAT-THEY-ARE-DOING ! 
9473	2024	ASPECT_RYKERWRITE_ 've made a lot of assertions . 
9474	2024	However , ASPECT_RYKERWRITE_ have provided zero in the way of supporting facts . 
9475	2025	I dont eat raw meat , and I wont vote for Obama either ... Jollee 
9476	2026	-LRB- quote = Dan40 ; 3076858 -RRB- More of the ` standard ' liberal game plan , `` Always attempt to twist any conservatives words to mean what ASPECT_DAN40_ know 100 % they did not mean . '' 
9477	2026	-LRB- quote -RRB- Take DAN40 easy , Dan , that was meant as a purely humorous remark . 
9478	2026	ASPECT_DAN40_ 'll note the LOL on the end ? 
9479	2026	And once again , unrelentingly , ASPECT_DAN40_ try to avoid reality by calling ONCE an opinion and pretending that makes ONCE equally valid to claim that the stimulus hurt the economy . 
9480	2026	That makes as much sense as saying that the idea of a round Earth is an opinion -LRB- which ONCE is -RRB- and therefore it is equally valid to say that the Earth is flat . 
9481	2026	Why are ASPECT_DAN40_ so determined to cling to an idea that both all the evidence and ASPECT_DAN40_ own theory says is wrong ? 
9482	2026	37 % of the stimulus was tax breaks , and ASPECT_DAN40_ have yet to hear \* anyone \* claim that tax cuts do n't stimulate the economy . 
9483	2026	ASPECT_DAN40_ 've repeatedly challenged ASPECT_DAN40_ to come up with a single shred of evidence that says the stimulus did n't help the economy and ASPECT_DAN40_ 've repeatedly utterly and completely failed . 
9484	2026	In any case , are ASPECT_DAN40_ seriously suggesting that if the financial sector had completely collapsed that things would n't have been much , much worse ? 
9485	2026	As in Great Depression levels of worse ? 
9486	2026	Is that 100 % absolutely certain ? 
9487	2026	Of course not , nothing in life is . 
9488	2026	COURSE 's not 100 % absolutely certain the sun will rise in the East tomorrow morning . 
9489	2026	Yes , politicians are human and fallible , and yes ONES do n't entirely know what ONES 're doing . 
9490	2026	Just like everyone else in the world . 
9491	2026	Here 's a news flash for EVERYONE , Dan , the free market is made up of humans who are just as fallible and just as often do n't know what ONES 're doing . 
9492	2026	Nobody forced the banks to make all those subprime mortgages , nobody forced the banks to encourage people to borrow more then PEOPLE could afford , and no one forced PEOPLE to bundle those bad debts as derivatives that have lead to so much grief . 
9493	2026	The politicians bear a lot of blame for getting us where US are . 
9494	2026	So does the market . 
9495	2026	ASPECT_DAN40_ argument about `` Why should ASPECT_DAN40_ trust politicians to get ASPECT_DAN40_ out of this mess when ONES 're the ones who got ASPECT_DAN40_ in MESS , '' can just as easily be applied to the market . 
9496	2026	There is no one single villain in this story , and there 's no single quick fix , either . 
9497	2026	And as for the $ 16,000,000,000.00 , ASPECT_DAN40_ seem to have no sense of scale when SENSE comes to money . 
9498	2026	that sum can just as easily be expressed as 0.016 petadollars or as 1,600,000,000,000,000 millicents . 
9499	2026	So what ? 
9500	2026	Changing units and moving a decimal point to make something look bigger or smaller is a silly tactic . 
9501	2026	The difference between 50 and 66 is not huge , especially when ASPECT_DAN40_ 're talking about estimates of something there is a \* lot \* of uncertainty about . 
9502	2026	Even if DIFFERENCE is in billions of dollars . 
9503	2027	Ummm ... say what ... ?!?!?! 
9504	2028	The statement is perfectly coherent . 
9505	2028	ASPECT_SIDETRAKD_ need to read STATEMENT again . 
9506	2029	And , as is normally the case with liberal meme 's , CASE is completely divorced from reality . 
9507	2030	Is it ? 
9508	2030	And as is normally the case with the right wing meme , CASE is completely divorced from the truth . 
9509	2030	No one did force the banks to do those things . 
9510	2030	So what exactly was objectionable about the statement , other than it was a reality which clashed with ASPECT_SIDETRAKD_ preconceived notions . 
9511	2031	The fact that the statement was about as divorced from reality as STATEMENT could get . 
9512	2031	Of course , ASPECT_FRODLY_ live in opposite world , so we do n't expect ASPECT_FRODLY_ to understand . 
9513	2031	Banks were indeed pressured into giving low income -LRB- read sub-prime -RRB- loans . 
9514	2031	People were widely encouraged to enter into home ownership , despite the fact that PEOPLE could not afford OWNERSHIP , and it was the GSEs , through government pressure , that started the entire practice of sub-prime bundling . 
9515	2031	So yeah ... What SUB-PRIME said was true , if by `` true '' ASPECT_FRODLY_ mean `` completely false '' . 
9516	2032	Almost everything THEY say here is an easily disproven lie . 
9518	2032	No they were n't . 
9519	2032	The government was involved in the subprime industry , but 85 % of all subprime mortgages were issues by private industries . 
9520	2032	http:\/\/www.mcclatchydc.com\/2008\/10\/1...ixzz12xTyWY91AI suggest ASPECT_SIDETRAKD_ read this as well . 
9521	2032	http:\/\/knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu\/a...articleid=1812The reality is , the largest role government played in the creation and collapse of the housing bubble , was keeping interests far too low for far too long . 
9522	2032	Not Fannie and Freddy , nor government forcing banks to give loans -LRB- REALITY did n't happen -RRB- , etc. Securitization of debt was also not something forced on the banks by government . 
9523	2032	GOVERNMENT has a long history , and I can not imagine where ASPECT_SIDETRAKD_ came up with the idea that IDEA was forced onto anyone by banks -LRB- for future reference , FUTURE is best to provide links to support such absurd claims -RRB- . 
9524	2032	Read up a bit on GOVERNMENT 's history . 
9525	2032	http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/SecuritizationSubprime bundling is 100 % a phenomenon of private institutions . 
9526	2032	ASPECT_SIDETRAKD_ really need to either educate ASPECT_SIDETRAKD_ and read up on these issues , or stop reading dishonest sources that lie and distort the facts . 
9527	2032	The reality is government certainly had a role to play in causing this crisis , but they were not the only catalyst , nor the main catalyst . 
9528	2032	There is plenty of blame to share between government , banks , and people who took out debt THEY could n't possible service . 
9529	2032	ASPECT_SIDETRAKD_ schewed dishonest partisan view of the issue , means it is best not to make declarative statements , because when VIEW comes to this issue , ASPECT_SIDETRAKD_ do n't know what ASPECT_SIDETRAKD_ are talking about . 
9530	2033	The government was the initial mover of sub-prime loans . 
9531	2033	ONES were the ones that initially pushed banks into issuing loans , and , because those loans were so risky , ONES pushed the GSEs into bundling ONES to mitigate the risk . 
9532	2033	No one in the private sector wanted to touch that market , originally . 
9533	2033	It was the GSEs , with ONES wink and a nod hint that these bundles would be insured by the government against loss , that spurred the initial private investor involvement . 
9534	2033	The only truth at all to ASPECT_FRODLY_ words is that the private sector and Wall Street investors were deeply involved by the time SECTOR all crashed . 
9535	2033	TRUTH had taken a life of TRUTH 's own in the private markets , leaving the GSEs with less than half of all bundling . 
9536	2033	But INVOLVEMENT was government involvement in the markets that got the ball rolling , in the first place . 
9537	2035	Sometimes Dan seems to have a bit of a tendency to sound like government is always the cause of all problems , and letting the free market operate unfettered is the solution to everything . 
9538	2035	My point was simply that the mess we find WE in was not caused simply by Washington ordering banks and other institutions to make unwise financial decisions . 
9539	2035	Bad policy decisions in the government certainly played a role , but decisions made in the private sector were a big big factor in causing the recession . 
9540	2035	Just pointing out there 's plenty of blame to go around . 
9541	2035	Like Alan Greenspan said about the behavior of mortgage lenders , Those of WE who have looked to the self-interest of lending institutions to protect shareholders equity , MY included , are in a state of shocked disbelief . 
9543	2037	Still using the NY Times liberal propaganda machine as a source ? 
9544	2037	NYT long ago stopped paying any attention to TRUTH . 
9545	2037	Use better , less biased sources . 
9546	2037	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ do not see me using Fox News as a source for the same reason . 
9547	2037	Is the Govt strictly to blame ? 
9548	2037	VERY NEARLY . 
9549	2037	Yes the private sector did jump in and take FULL advantage of the license to steal that the Govt gave them . 
9550	2037	Should that come as a surprise ? 
9551	2037	Had the Govt NOT created the atmosphere and opportunity for near illegal business practices , the private sector would not have BEEN ABLE to take advantage of a situation that did not exist . 
9552	2037	Being the old fart that ME am , ME remember the days when bankers were the most cautious business people around . 
9553	2037	The old joke was that to get a loan , ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ had to prove to the banker that ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ absolutely did not need the money ! 
9554	2037	If ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ did not have 20 % down and excellent credit and a good and permanent job , RENT . 
9555	2037	Because ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ would not get a loan . 
9556	2037	Bankers had no intention of changing PEOPLE attitudes and practices , the Govt insisted that ALL had a right to own a house whether PEOPLE could afford HOUSE or not . 
9557	2037	As totally stupid as that sounds , our elected representatives actually said such things . 
9558	2037	And REQUIRED that bankers act toward that end . 
9559	2037	Do ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ leave ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ car running with the doors and windows open and the keys in CAR , parked on a downtown street while ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ go shopping ? 
9560	2037	NO , ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ do n't . 
9561	2037	But that is what the Govt did with the mortgage and financial industries . 
9562	2037	Yes the private sector still had to be dishonest and drive away in the car , so they are not blameless . 
9563	2037	ME know ME to be absolutely honest , but ME 've never been tempted with BILLIONS with no fear of prosecution . 
9564	2039	Well , that would be one of my problems with Greenspan . 
9565	2039	Because once the government implied that THAT would back those bundles against loss , even though it was n't supposed to be true , ONCE opened the door to full fledged involvement of the markets . 
9566	2039	Of course , ONCE was reckless , but THAT were doing what the government wanted THAT to do . 
9567	2039	A lot of people saw the problem develop and tried to put a stop to STOP . 
9568	2039	Sad that Greenspan was astonished by LOT all . 
9569	2039	That self-interest of the lending institutions had the government interest of pushing the sub-prime loans super-imposed on top of SELF-INTEREST . 
9570	2039	What really galls me is to see Obama , of all people , wag OBAMA finger at the banks , as if OBAMA had no personal involvement in the entire mess . 
9571	2039	And now , we 're supposed to forget what started NOW all , and accept Obama 's tired analogy of Republicans driving the car into the ditch . 
9572	2039	NOW 's quite ridiculous . 
9573	2040	ASPECT_DAN40_ logic is completely flawed . 
9574	2040	If not for government , the environment to do these sorts of things would have happened naturally . 
9575	2040	With no restrictions in place , THINKERS would have done the same thing . 
9576	2040	Without restriction , a license to steal exists naturally , only curbed by others ability to use force to protect THINKERS assets . 
9577	2040	Government NEVER required banks to do what THINKERS did . 
9578	2040	THINKERS did NEVER because THINKERS were short term thinkers who ignored the long term consequences of THINKERS actions , in order to gain the short term benefits . 
9579	2040	That has nothing to do with government , and everything to do with the modern business environment . 
9580	2040	The assumption that underlies most right wing economic thought is that we assume rational actors . 
9581	2040	The reality is , that assumption can not accurately be made . 
9582	2040	People 's actions are far too often irrational to make that assumption . 
9583	2040	The irrationality of the actions of bankers and people taking loans , combined with the artificially low interest rates -LRB- an idea advanced by Friedman -RRB- , created this mess . 
9584	2040	So government had a role to play , but to say that very nearly all blame lies with government is beyond absurd . 
9585	2041	Oh , for crying out loud , Dan , DAN was only citing the NY Times to source the Greenspan quote , and DAN only used that because it was the first source Google found for DAN . 
9586	2041	Since there 's no real dispute about what GREENSPAN said , DAN did n't feel the need to wade through the minutes of the Congressional hearing GREENSPAN said CONGRESSIONAL at . 
9587	2041	: PAnd do n't GREENSPAN see the irony of accusing the government of encouraging `` near illegal business practices '' considering that DISPUTE 's only the government 's actions that make illegal practices illegal in the first place ? 
9588	2041	Errr , what personal involvement ? 
9589	2041	Obama was strictly a private citizen before Jan 2005 , and not involved in the financial sector at all . 
9590	2041	And while DAN 'm certainly not an expert , DAN do n't recall any important financial legislation going through the Senate between then and Jan 2009 . 
9591	2041	Unless someone can correct DAN on that ? 
9592	2042	I certainly can . 
9593	2042	Although many other Senators and Representatives had a much deeper involvement with blocking meaningful reform at the GSEs , Obama himself was one of the top five recipients of funds from the GSEs during OBAMA term as Senator . 
9594	2042	During that time , Senate Bill 190 was released from committee favorably to the floor , but was never brought to debate because the Democrats made BILL very clear that SENATORS were in lockstep opposition to OPPOSITION , and Republicans did not have enough votes to push for TIME on SENATORS own . 
9595	2042	Obama was one of those Senators . 
9596	2042	http:\/\/www.govtrack.us\/users\/questio...=bill:s109-190This is the bill that McCain unsuccessfully sought to revive during the election , and Obama refused to do so , even though , by then , the problem was VERY apparent to anyone that was paying attention to PROBLEM , and had grown far worse even just since the bill was first released from committee . 
9597	2042	Now , that does nothing to say that Obama was anywhere near as involved as certain others , especially Dodd , who had so much involvement with the housing crash that OBAMA literally retired at the end of OBAMA term . 
9598	2042	But Mr. Obama 's current rhetoric on the causes of our economic situation simply flies in the face of reality , and OBAMA is far more culpable for the situation than OBAMA would like anyone to believe . 
9599	2043	Not at this point he cant make up HE mind ! 
9600	2043	HE is screwing up the economy ... Jollee

9603	2045	Odd ASPECT_RAYMOND_JAMES_ would say that with a melon head like Biden as Vice President .

9605	2045	, not IN !!

9607	2047	read I signiture 
9608	2048	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ might want to extensively research this : From the Orlando paper : `` Gore was right that foundations will play a key role in keeping the climate scam alive as evidence of outright climate fraud grows , just as ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ were critical in the beginning when the Joyce Foundation in 2000 and 2001 provided the seed money to start the Chicago Climate Exchange . 
9609	2048	THIS started trading in 2003 , and what THIS trades is , essentially , air . 
9610	2048	More specifically perhaps , hot air . 
9611	2048	The Chicago Climate Exchange -LRB- CCX -RRB- advertises EXCHANGE as `` North America 's only cap-and-trade system for all six greenhouse gases , with global affiliates and projects worldwide . '' 
9612	2048	Barack Obama served on the board of the Joyce Foundation from 1994 to 2002 when the CCX startup grants were issued . 
9613	2048	As president , pushing cap-and-trade is one of his highest priorities . 
9614	2048	Now is n't that special ? 
9615	2048	`` The CCX is supposed to become worth $ 10 TRILLION if Cap 'n' Trade is passed . 
9616	2048	OBAMA 'd say that is very close to the private citizen BHO , being involved in international financial matters . 
9617	2050	How bizarre ... vote for the abject failure , not the one who has n't yet had a chance ... who actually has more real world political and executive experience than the failure . 
9618	2050	This is really the mindset that ASPECT_CASTLE_ carry through life ? 
9619	2051	All we can do is chuckle , anymore . 
9620	2052	Errr , that 's a teeny bit off topic , Dan - we were talking about the economy , the financial industry , and the stimulus , not climate change or cap and trade . 
9621	2052	But since ASPECT_DAN40_ brought ERRR up ... `` Climate scam '' ? 
9622	2052	`` Climate fraud '' ? 
9623	2052	And ASPECT_DAN40_ accuse liberals of drinking kool-aid ? 
9624	2052	Come on Dan , the debate over the reality of climate change is over . 
9625	2052	DEBATE ended 29 August 2005 . 
9626	2052	The evidence that DEBATE is happening is absolutely overwhelming at this point , and trying to pretend there 's a scientific debate about EVIDENCE is about on a level with the big tobacco execs going before Congress back in the 80 's and saying that EXECS did n't believe that EXECS product is addictive or causes disease . 
9627	2052	If ASPECT_DAN40_ 're thinking of the so called climategate email - the one that said something about finding a trick to hide the decline - I 'm afraid ASPECT_DAN40_ 've been bamboozeled . 
9628	2052	That was one email out of more then a thousand , taken completely out of context and given a heaping helping of innuendo . 
9629	2052	Using those methods , ASPECT_DAN40_ could make almost anyone look like an ax murderer . 
9630	2052	The trick was as in , `` Hey , ASPECT_DAN40_ just learned a great new trick for solving differential equations , '' and the general context was a discussion of finding a way to integrate very different kinds of data into a coherent whole . 
9631	2052	Which usually ai n't easy , let I tell ASPECT_DAN40_ . 
9632	2052	The people involved in that email have had PEOPLE work gone over with a fine toothed comb , and absolutely no wrong doing or data manipulation has been found . 
9633	2052	The worst PEOPLE were guilty of was griping about having to hand PEOPLE raw data over to someone PEOPLE felt would misuse WORST . 
9634	2052	And even if ASPECT_DAN40_ chose not to believe that , ASPECT_DAN40_ could throw out the entire life 's work of those guys and there would still be a mountain of evidence saying that climate change is real and CHANGE is happening . 
9635	2052	In some cases literal mountains - alpine glaciers have been retreating dramatically around the world for decades . 
9636	2052	ASPECT_DAN40_ have the historical climate records of the last century or two , ice cores from Greenland , Antarctica , and alpine glaciers from around the world , tree ring data from around the world , lake and ocean sediment evidence from around the world - all of which point to the exact same thing : CO2 levels in the atmosphere have spiked and temperatures are rising dramatically . 
9637	2052	The debate now is about how bad the effects are really going to be , and how much we can and should do about DEBATE . 
9638	2052	And even if ASPECT_DAN40_ still insist on denying climate change , how can ASPECT_DAN40_ seriously argue that getting off of fossil fuels , particularly oil , is an important and urgent priority ? 
9639	2052	Being depending on oil imports form the Middle East has big and obvious political and economic effects . 
9640	2052	And WE 've hit peak oil - even with improving technology the total amount of oil produced is going to start an inexorable decline from now on . 
9641	2052	That plus the surging demand for oil from rapidly developing parts of the world like India and China ... supply and demand , anyone ? 
9642	2052	And before ASPECT_DAN40_ start saying that the market will take care of MARKET ... WE 've known since the 70 's that WE need to get off of oil , and what has the private sector done about MARKET ? 
9643	2052	Not a thing . 
9644	2052	WE 've been sitting on WE thumbs for decades . 
9645	2052	The Brazilians , for example , have not . 
9646	2052	They decided after the oil shocks of the 70 's that THEY were going to be energy independent , and guess what ? 
9647	2052	THEY are . 
9648	2052	Thanks to determined action , the Brazilian economy mostly runs on home grown sugar cane ethanol - THEY import virtually no oil at all . 
9649	2052	Oil prices are going to start going up inexorably from now on , that 's just a fact of life . 
9650	2052	If that rise is gradual , sure , then the market will be able to deal with RISE . 
9651	2052	But what if RISE 's not gradual ? 
9652	2052	We saw just a few years ago that prices can spike dramatically in a very short amount of time , even without things like terrorism or international politics getting involved . 
9653	2052	What if oil prices double in a month - for several months in a row ? 
9654	2052	Is that a risk worth taking ? 
9655	2053	Once again ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ do ONCE . 
9656	2053	There are 2 paragraphs highlighted . 
9657	2053	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ pick the first onlt and then drone on and on with opinion stated as fact . 
9658	2053	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ unceasing habit . 
9659	2053	ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ believe Climate Change to be a reality , but no such FACTUAL reality has been proven . 
9660	2053	I 'm not saying CHANGE is not real , I 'm very doubtful as climate does fluctuate , but I do n't know either way . 
9661	2053	But ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ ignored the second and more important paragraph . 
9662	2053	If BHO IS deeply involved in the CCX , then BHO serves only BHO bank account when talking about energy bills , not the USA . 
9663	2054	And once again ASPECT_DAN40_ do ONCE , trying to ignore inconvenient facts by labeling them as opinions . 
9664	2054	ONCE is a fact that the evidence for anthropogenic climate change is overwhelming , not an opinion , and even cursory research would tell ASPECT_DAN40_ that . 
9665	2054	And ASPECT_DAN40_ completely ignore the fact that the real concrete goal of cap and trade is to get us off of fossil fuels . 
9666	2054	But , since ASPECT_DAN40_ want me to directly address President Obama 's personal involvement in CCX , let 's review : Noungrant -LRB- plural grants -RRB- 1 . 
9667	2054	The act of granting ; a bestowing or conferring ; concession ; allowance ; permission .2 . 
9668	2054	The yielding or admission of something in dispute .3 . 
9669	2054	The thing or property granted ; a gift ; a boon .4 . 
9670	2054	A transfer of property by deed or writing ; especially , au appropriation or conveyance made by the government ; as , a grant of land or of money ; also , the deed or writing by which the transfer is made . 
9671	2054	Nounfoundation -LRB- plural foundations -RRB- 4 . 
9672	2054	A donation or legacy appropriated to support a charitable institution , and constituting a permanent fund ; endowment .5 . 
9673	2054	That which is founded , or established by endowment ; an endowed institution or charity . 
9674	2054	ASPECT_DAN40_ will note the distinct lack of words like `` loan '' `` investment '' or `` repayment '' in these definitions . 
9675	2054	How then does the Joyce Foundation have any financial interest in the worth of CCX ? 
9676	2054	And even if they did , how would that financially benefit President Obama ? 
9677	2054	Being a former board member does not give MEMBER a financial stake in FOUNDATION . 
9678	2054	And even if MEMBER did have some sort of investment in STAKE , which ME do n't think is even possible with a charitable foundation , Obama 's assets have been put in a blind trust , like all Presidents . 
9679	2054	So , Dan , ME 'm afraid ASPECT_DAN40_ logic fails not once , not twice , but three times . 
9680	2055	Naive , to infinity . 
9681	2055	CCX is not a charitable foundation . 
9682	2056	Nooooo , but the Joyce Foundation is . 
9683	2056	And ASPECT_DAN40_ still have three gaps in ASPECT_DAN40_ argument to bridge . 
9684	2057	Not too many take out newspaper adds of their corruption . 
9685	2057	THEIR do n't want ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ liberals looking too foolish . 
9686	2059	ASPECT_CASTLE_ must be independently wealthy ! 
9687	2059	ASPECT_CASTLE_ are not seeing what real citizens see ! 
9690	2063	LEARN TO SPELL !! 
9691	2063	Please - use a frickin ' dictionary - ASPECT_JOLLEE_ might do better in ASPECT_JOLLEE_ business . 
9692	2064	hAAAAA , LEARN TOO GET A GOOD JOB , ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ PROBABLY DONT NEED ONE BUT i DO , MY EMOLYEES DO ok ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ JUST a DIFFERENT BIRD !

9695	2065	fUNNY AND BRILLIANT !

9697	2065	JOLLEE KEEP FUNNY UP , ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ ARE INTELLEGENT ! 
9699	2067	IF I HAD CERTAINITY IN THE ECONOMY , I WOULD NOT HIRE ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ ... our EMPLOYEES OUR LIKE FAMILY ... OUR PAY FOR THEIR GLASSES THEIR COUSINS OPERATION , THEIR DAUGHTERS LEG BRACE ETC. ... ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ ARE ONE WHO WOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED PART OF THIS BUSINESS FAMILY ... ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ WOULD NEVER BE HIRED , TOO PROTECT OUR FAMILY NOW , WE CAN NOT HIRE ANYONE !

9701	2067	ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ EMPLOYMENSHIP WOULD BE CONSIDERED A LOOSER ! 
9703	2069	Love ASPECT_FPOLITICS_ philosophy , PHILOSOPHY a shame really ... 
9704	2070	Climate change !!!!!!!!!!! 
9705	2070	Now I 'm more than a bit older than ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ , but still I 've been around for well less than a century . 
9706	2070	A mere 70 years . 
9707	2070	In that time I 've lived thru : A cold period in a general warming trend . 
9708	2070	A warming period in a general cooling trend . 
9709	2070	A very warm period of a general warming trend . 
9710	2070	A very cold period of a general cooling trend . 
9711	2070	Stable periods in a generally unstable climate . 
9712	2070	Unstable periods in a generally stable climate . 
9713	2070	ALL of the above have been `` official '' decrees by learned people that study such climatic events . 
9714	2070	All of the above are not possible in one short lifetime , yet PEOPLE all have been official proclamations . 
9715	2070	Now we are told that WE have warmed up a small part of A DEGREE since 1900 . 
9716	2070	Less than one half of one degree warmer now than HALF was 110 years ago . 
9717	2070	In order for that to be true , WE must assume that temperature recordings in 1900 were accurate to within less than one half of one degree . 
9718	2070	So do ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_ BELIEVE that temp recordings 110 years ago were accurate to within 100 % to 99.75 % I have very serious doubts that they were . 
9719	2071	Well , in order to decide what to make of something like changing pronouncements on where the climate is going , CLIMATE helps to understand a bit about the nature of science . 
9720	2071	Science is never absolutely certain , and is never finished . 
9721	2071	The basic premise of science is to admit that neither a researcher or their instruments can ever be perfect - ASPECT_DAN40_ do the best ASPECT_DAN40_ can , make an estimate of how close ASPECT_DAN40_ figure ASPECT_DAN40_ probably got to the truth , and then leave the best record ASPECT_DAN40_ can as a guide to the next person to come along and tackle the problem . 
9722	2071	That 's true of even the most well established and respected theories in science . 
9723	2071	Take the theory of gravity - PREMISE does n't get much more certain then gravity , does THEORY ? 
9724	2071	And yet just a few years ago NASA sent up a satellite called Gravity Probe B to try and poke holes in B . 
9725	2071	As far as scientists are concerned , YEARS 's a win win - if SCIENTISTS can find holes , then SCIENTISTS can address SCIENTISTS and make the theory better , and if SCIENTISTS ca n't , YEARS increases the confidence SCIENTISTS have in the theory . 
9726	2071	So I 'm not really sure what `` official pronouncements '' ASPECT_DAN40_ may have heard , but I can guarantee that no peer reviewed article would have made such a claim with absolute certainty . 
9727	2071	In fact , I figure NO 's more then likely that what ASPECT_DAN40_ heard was n't coming from scientists at all ; it was probably the news media taking some tentative research and blowing RESEARCH up to make a good headline . 
9728	2071	ASPECT_DAN40_ know how people complain that one day scientists say that food X will make ASPECT_DAN40_ live a hundred years , and the next day PEOPLE 're saying ONE 'll kill ASPECT_DAN40_ ? 
9729	2071	That 's not science doing that , that 's the media . 
9730	2071	A scientist will say , `` Well , after following so many people for so many years who were eating so much of food X , ASPECT_DAN40_ saw the following outcomes . '' 
9731	2071	Science is in the business of dealing with very complex and hard to understand things , BUSINESS 's in the business of nuance . 
9732	2071	As I think PEOPLE all know , the news media does n't much care for complexity or nuance . 
9733	2071	So , does all this apply to climate change ? 
9735	2071	Are scientists absolutely certain that human caused climate change is happening ? 
9737	2071	Could NO. turn out later that this was all a big mistake , a misinterpretation of faulty data or something ? 
9739	2071	Then why should we listen to warnings of climate change ? 
9740	2071	Because life never gives WE certainties , and all WE can do is make the best decisions WE can with what WE have . 
9741	2071	Generally speaking , science gets better as time goes on . 
9742	2071	What a scientist says today is going to be more reliable then what they were saying yesterday . 
9743	2071	Global warming has been a major topic of research for a good thirty years now , and as time goes on , the evidence that TIME is happening has mounted , and the uncertainties shrunken , until today there is consensus in the scientific community that the evidence overwhelmingly says EVIDENCE is happening . 
9744	2071	TOPIC 's about as certain as science ever gets about anything . 
9745	2071	In fact , the uncertainty is now so low that the American Association for the Advancement of Science -LRB- AAAS -RRB- and the National Academy of Sciences -LRB- NAS -RRB- have issued quite literally unprecedented statements about climate change . 
9746	2071	They 're saying that climate change is happening , ONES 're the ones doing QUESTION , QUESTION 's going to be bad , and we 'd better do something about QUESTION . 
9747	2071	The AAAS and NAS have \* never \* issued a call to action like that before , about anything . 
9748	2071	Why should ASPECT_DAN40_ listen to NEVER ? 
9749	2071	Because NEVER 're the most prestigious , most well respected organizations of the smartest , most well informed , and geekiest people on the planet . 
9750	2071	NEVER 've been around since the mid nineteenth century and have huge reputations to protect - NEVER reputations are NEVER bread and butter . 
9751	2071	There are probably no organizations on the planet with a stronger reason to make sure NEVER never ever say anything that could later make NEVER look foolish . 
9752	2071	These guys are the crown jewels of science , and what GUYS say is about as close as ASPECT_DAN40_ 're going to get to an official pronouncement of what science knows . 
9753	2071	If ASPECT_DAN40_ 're not convinced by what GUYS say , then nothing from science will ever convince ASPECT_DAN40_ of anything . 
9754	2071	And NOTHING 's not just the scientists . 
9755	2071	The Pentagon takes climate change so seriously that SCIENTISTS did n't even consider the question of PENTAGON reality in the February 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review -LRB- QDR -RRB- and went directly to considering how to deal with PENTAGON effects . 
9756	2071	There 's even an organization of major industries called US Climate Action Partnership calling for immediate action on the issue , that includes companies like Alcoa , Ford , GM , Chrysler , GE , Dow and Dupont . 
9757	2071	These are some of the companies that are going to be most directly effected by action to tackle climate change , and THESE 're saying we need to do QUESTION , now . 
9758	2071	If ASPECT_DAN40_ 're not going to believe these guys , who are ASPECT_DAN40_ going to believe ? 
9759	2071	Seriously , that 's not a rhetorical question . 
9760	2071	Who are ASPECT_DAN40_ going to believe ? 
9761	2071	AAAS statement : http:\/\/www.aaas.org\/news\/releases\/20...tatement.shtmlNAS statement : http:\/\/www7.nationalacademies.org\/oc...get_Review.aspFeb 2010 QDR , p. 84 , Crafting a Strategic Approach to Climate and Energy http:\/\/www.defense.gov\/qdr\/QDR%20as%...N10%201600.pdfUSCAP homepage : http:\/\/www.us-cap.org\/ 
9762	2073	Youngster , many , , , , , , Thousands , , , , , , , , , , Maybe millions of very definitive statements were made by scientists , writers , reporters , mathematicians , farmers , etc. etc. . 
9763	2073	Definitive statements on about every subject imaginable . 
9764	2073	All before our present ridiculous `` Age of Political Correctness . '' 
9765	2073	Now none open THOUSANDS mouths without `` plausible deniability . 
9766	2073	`` The fact that few have the stones to make a statement today , does not mean that FACT was not commonly done in the past . 
9767	2074	Hey , I 'm not saying that scientists are n't just as human as everyone else . 
9768	2074	We all have a bad tendency to overstate WE certainty at times , including I . 
9769	2074	But the basic principles of the scientific method have been firmly established for centuries . 
9770	2074	And there 's a big difference between what a scientist may say in casual conversation , or even when being interviewed by a reporter , and what SCIENTISTS put in SCIENTISTS formal articles for peer reviewed publications . 
9771	2074	There is no such thing as absolute certainty , ever . 
9772	2074	None of ASPECT_DAN40_ are infallible , and ASPECT_DAN40_ all believe things now that will later turn out to be wrong . 
9773	2074	ASPECT_DAN40_ SCIENTIST , everyone . 
9774	2074	And science is in the business of not only being aware of that inherent uncertainty in life , but to actually quantify BUSINESS . 
9775	2074	And the uncertainty ASPECT_DAN40_ have in the reality of climate change is now really really small . 
9776	2074	I mean , think about UNCERTAINTY - is the Pentagon in the habit of chasing after the latest intellectual fad ? 
9777	2074	If the military takes climate change seriously enough to devote significant resources to planning for MILITARY effects , do n't ASPECT_DAN40_ think that maybe ASPECT_DAN40_ should take MILITARY seriously too ? 
9778	2075	I know what ASPECT_DAN40_ mean , old people are really dumb in America , and PEOPLE tend to be very politically correct when AMERICA comes to Israel . 
9779	2076	Why would I vote for the further destruction of I country ? 
9780	2078	Maybe some teabagger ASPECT_AGENT_286_ hate so much might come up and kick the -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- bag-in-chiefs ass in 2012 . 
9781	2079	We are now 23 months out from the 2012 end of an error . 
9782	2079	At this point in time before the 2008 mistake , 23 unbelievable incompetence , obamalama had not announced 23 was running to destroy the presidency . 
9783	2081	Yes , the Republicans have a tall order to fill , but with Obama still at the helm , and Reid still in charge of the Senate , ORDER will most likely be gridlock , which is not so bad when ASPECT_JOEY_SAC_ look at Obama 's agenda . 
9784	2081	There is still plenty of Democratic face in Washington . 
9785	2081	Not all of the cards are in the hands of Republicans . 
9786	2083	DanNO40 is just another disgruntled , military retiree who , like a drunk sailor , regurgitates SAILOR slurred , negative comments that lack substance and sources for authenticity . 
9787	2083	IOW , IOW 's mostly opinion and fetid hot air . 
9788	2083	As a matter of fact , DanNO actually makes Obama look brilliant by contrast . 
9789	2083	MATTER 's not that FAN am a die-hard Obama fan . 
9790	2083	FAN am not . 
9791	2083	But , considering the unnecessary concessions Obama has made to get bi-partisan support , FAN now concede that Obama probably will be a one-term President . 
9792	2083	Day-by-day , -LRB- The most recent pay freeze on Executive government employees insures that overworked , understaffed agencies will NOT be able to enforce current law , let alone any more that the Congress passes . -RRB- 
9793	2083	DAY-BY-DAY makes decisions that turn DAY-BY-DAY base support away from DAY-BY-DAY . 
9794	2083	That 's why the Dems lost the House : DAY-BY-DAY base deserted DAY-BY-DAY because of DAY-BY-DAY timid response to the teabag party and everything EMPLOYEES and the remaining follow-the-herd Republicans stand far . 
9795	2083	The most probable Republican to win the nomination in 2012 is Jeb Bush . 
9796	2083	REPUBLICAN 'll be able to beat Obama because the Dems are too timid -LRB- read politically inept -RRB- to nominate a candidate with a stainless steel backbone and political acumen sufficient to beat the Fox News corporate , propaganda machine . 
9797	2086	A blind drunken lemming well beyond 100 % supportive of the incompetent obamalama denies that OBAMALAMA is a completely brainwashed supporter of the presidential idiot no matter what SUPPORTER fxxks up now and forever , accuses OBAMALAMA of `` slurred '' comments ? 
9798	2086	ASPECT_SASSY_ may find REPUBLICAN comments NOT to ASPECT_SASSY_ liking but they are certainly not ` slurred . 
9799	2086	` And as proof of ASPECT_SASSY_ mindless support in spite of facts to the contrary , REPUBLICAN cite ASPECT_SASSY_ own statement , '' unnecessary concessions Obama has made to get bi-partisan support , '' . 
9800	2086	The incompetent idiot obamalama has made NO bi-partisan efforts other than lip service to those words . 
9801	2086	ALL of his actions have been completely leftist partisanship actions . 
9802	2086	OBAMALAMA has made NO concessions , no compromises , no negotiations . 
9803	2086	OBAMALAMA has asked that Republicans -LRB- and REPUBLICAN 'm NOT a Republican -RRB- to show bi-partisanship by capitulating and agreeing with OBAMALAMA idiocy . 
9804	2086	That is what left wing idiots see as a bi-partisan effort . 
9805	2086	EFFORT is a insult to the other party no matter who does EFFORT . 
9806	2086	Dum-dum obamalama has not served a day in the White House where OBAMALAMA has needed a single Republican vote on anything and OBAMALAMA has not received a single Republican vote that got a bill passed . 
9807	2086	The Democrats have been coerced , bribed , and earmarked into voting for what OBAMALAMA wanted . 
9808	2086	Do NOT try to blame ANY of the bills passed the last 2 years on Republicans . 
9809	2086	The blame is totally Democrat . 
9810	2086	Since Jan. 3 2007 , The Democratic Party has had and does have until Jan 2011 , TOTAL control of both houses of Congress . 
9811	2086	Republicans could neither vote a bill down nor block a vote on a bill since 1\/3\/2007 . 
9812	2086	And to finalize ASPECT_SASSY_ utter wrongness . 
9813	2086	REPUBLICAN am retired and REPUBLICAN did serve in the military and am honorably discharged . 
9814	2086	But REPUBLICAN 'm a retired businessman , not a retired military officer . 
9815	2086	REPUBLICAN served honorably and well and then moved on with REPUBLICAN life . 
9816	2087	No , I want a healthy economy ! 
9817	2089	I would love a Libertarian too kick LIBERTARIAN ass !

9830	2091	FAN reproduce FAN original post so that there is no doubt about what FAN said before one reads DanNO40 's post , quoted above . 
9831	2091	First , if DanNO was a military officer , FAN now understand why the current crop -LRB- over the last 60 years -RRB- of military officers are idealogical Puritans compared to those that led us after WWII . 
9832	2091	The current horse hockey rampage over DADT is indicative of the bigotry and intolerance -LRB- and perhaps , `` homophobia '' fears OFFICERS conceal in OFFICERS hearts -RRB- these 18th century ideologues have instilled in the minds of the lay public at large . 
9833	2091	If gays of either gender are openly accepted , GAYS inappropriate sexual behavior will be no more condoned\/tolerated than that of inappropriate heterosexual behavior . 
9834	2091	To quote a popular President , `` GAYS have nothing to fear but fear BEHAVIOR ! 
9835	2091	`` As for DanNO 's claim to be a businessman , PRESIDENT 'd say the business community 's behavior since WWII is nothing about which to be proud , i.e. the systematic `` bubble '' to `` burst '' to recession and subsequent climatic downward spiral for the Middle Class . 
9836	2091	Reciting figures to prove that slide is reported daily in every newspaper op-ed , so to quote SLIDE again here is redundant . 
9837	2091	In response to : -LRB- RevAnarchist That would be wonderful Jollee , and there are many libertarians at heart that run as republicans . 
9838	2091	As ASPECT_DAN40_ know , Libertarians are for less big government and most want the more individual responsibility . 
9839	2091	FAN beleive that instead of government entitlement programs the local community especially the church should provide for those in need . 
9840	2091	Of course a -LRB- government -RRB- safety net should be available for the working poor and single moms , who are high on FAN respect list , very high ! 
9841	2091	Maybe with enough prayer and work an electable candidate may emerge . 
9842	2091	There are many good republicans and a couple that may be electable with the right political machine behind REPUBLICANS . 
9843	2091	The media , especially cesspools like MSNBC attack most conservative candidates as well as sitting presidents and members of congress etc. . 
9844	2091	CANDIDATES ruined Palin with a well crafted propagandist hack job that capitalized on Palins inexperience and her unpolished political persona . 
9845	2091	HER lack of nonsensical knowledge was used as an ambush to further discredit HER through no fault of HER own . 
9846	2091	However Palin is an accomplished intelligent and good politician , HER simply had some mean powerful groups against HER and GROUPS hurt HER . 
9847	2091	Personally FAN think GROUPS -LRB- the MSNBC 's of the media etc -RRB- propaganda and hack job was repugnant and demonstrated how low GROUPS would go to smear someone that GROUPS did not like , namely a white christian woman . 
9848	2091	Maybe the Karma police will pay GROUPS back in full . 
9849	2091	Hey we can hope and pray for justice eh Jollee ? 
9850	2091	rev -RRB- FAN have only one thing to say : FAN categorically disagree with every word ASPECT_DAN40_ posted . 
9851	2091	Palin is a beauty pageant air head with a penchant , like Bratboy Bush , to appeal to the simplistic , folksy , anti-elitist moralistic attitude most of WE wish for but never had nor will have . 
9852	2091	What ASPECT_DAN40_ tout is artificial to reality . 
9853	2091	TODAY 's the same synthetic flavored ice-slush with which Ronald Reagan won the Presidency , and PRESIDENCY 's even less true today than TODAY was then : The `` churches '' wo n't fill the needs for the poor and TODAY 's a idealogical vagrant government that does n't . 
9854	2091	As for ASPECT_DAN40_ decidedly `` irreverent '' and erroneous description of MSNBC , FAN direct ASPECT_DAN40_ to FactCheck.org for a lesson in `` truthiness . '' 
9855	2091	POOR provide sources for POOR objective analysis . 
9856	2091	Fox News does n't cut NEWS ! 
9857	2091	And , Jolee , FAN have less respect for Libertarians than FAN do for NeoCons , and that 's several marks below Satan 's half acre in Hell . 
9858	2091	Rand Paul was named after Ayn Rand whose most remarkable work was the novel , Atlas Shrugged . 
9859	2091	Do a bit of Googling and find out what Libertarianism is all about . 
9860	2091	ASPECT_DAN40_ may not be so enthralled about less government , especially if ASPECT_DAN40_ ever end up disabled , old\/very young or without a job through no fault of ASPECT_DAN40_ own .

9867	2093	ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ are saying Palin 's `` nonsensical knowledge '' and '' inexperience '' is no fault of her own ? 
9868	2093	ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ obviously have no clue about reality then my friend . 
9869	2094	She wont be running for president , SHE will give the job too someone much more experienced ... Thats what America needs now ! 
9870	2094	We all need to be able to live and support WE ... Jollee 
9871	2095	Good to hear , because Palin would destroy the country . 
9872	2096	INDEPENDANT dont think she has enough experience , but neither does President Obama ... INDEPENDANT still wont vote for inexperience on either side , INDEPENDANT am an Independant ... Jollee 
9873	2097	Yeah but BUT makes for it in brain matter . 
9874	2097	Palin does n't have a brain unfortunately for her . 
9876	2097	No party is the best party . 
9877	2098	Glad we agree on something ... Jollee 
9878	2099	ASPECT_JOLLEE_ should read this . 
9879	2099	American Christians of the right hate gays ; Christian right 
9880	2102	Palin will not be running , Chris Christie , Thume or another will ... THUME will be a landslide just like the Carter Presidency ! 
9881	2102	She just likes to keep ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ jumping ! 
9883	2103	How much ASPECT_JOLLEE_ wanna bet ? 
9884	2103	I recon ten bucks ASPECT_JOLLEE_ 're totally wrong . 
9886	2103	ASPECT_JOLLEE_ mean committing right ? 
9887	2103	her daughter keeps I jumping 
9888	2104	I will bit ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ a million minion ! 
9889	2105	What the hell do ASPECT_JOLLEE_ mean by `` bit '' and what the hell is million minion ?! 
9890	2106	Palin is no more the joke than Dear Leader Obama . 
9891	2106	Hell , Charlie Rangel could do a better job than Opie so no vote for the Messiah in 2012 .

9895	2108	ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ `` thinking '' is evidently deeply influenced by ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ total ideological brainwashing . 
9896	2108	Americans , the majority , NOT the brainwashed liberal ideologues , are extremely angry at the gross incompetence and often incredible stupidity of the obamalama . 
9897	2108	INCOMPETENCE is not disappointment , INCOMPETENCE IS anger . 
9898	2108	The only people disappointed are the idiots that thought OBAMALAMA had anything to offer in the first place , OBAMALAMA DID NOT . 
9899	2108	OBAMALAMA got elected by claiming to be different from Bush . 
9900	2108	Turns out OBAMALAMA is different from Bush . 
9901	2108	OBAMALAMA 's worse than Bush . 
9902	2108	This far out from the 2008 election , NOBODY had ever heard of BHO except BHO puppetmasters . 
9903	2108	So between now and the 2012 elections a dozen or more candidates can appear in the limelight . 
9904	2108	And if the obamalama continues to do as rotten as job as OBAMALAMA has , , , , , , , , , half those new candidates could be liberal Democrats .

9910	2109	I have been saying that all along . 
9911	2109	I said Obama is stupid , OBAMA is but OBAMA is dangerous stupid like any serial killer is dangerous stupid . 
9912	2109	DID do not know right from wrong in many cases . 
9913	2109	That is Obama in a nutshell -LRB- pun intended -RRB- . 
9914	2109	OBAMA thinks OBAMA is doing us a favor , when in reality OBAMA is the worst thing that has happened to this country since another dumb democrat ; Jimmy Carter . 
9915	2109	Carter is a much better citizen than president . 
9917	2110	Mega , what direction has he shown ? 
9918	2110	Bush 's popularity is getting close to BUSH . 
9919	2110	Do ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ realize if health care goes down the tubes then the only accomplishment BUSH has that 's significant is backing Bush 's tax cuts ... ironic , huh . 
9922	2110	Lowden pointed that out ... HERE THAT LOWDEN ??? 
9923	2113	It is utterly amazing !!! 
9924	2113	Democrats have had TOTAL control of the House and Senate since Jan , 3 . 
9926	2113	And retain control until the end of this year . 
9927	2113	Yet in 1095 days they have managed to pass a failed Stimulus bill . 
9928	2113	An unconstitutional and horrendous health care bill that is the worst legislation EVER considered let alone passed , and THEY have passed a business regulation bill that makes American business difficult to be in and completely non-competitive with any other nation anywhere , and ASPECT_MODUS_PONENS_ blame conservatives . 
9929	2113	Liberal loonyism at BILL best . 
9930	2113	ASPECT_MODUS_PONENS_ had the Democrat votes to pass ANYTHING , and only accomplished a few sadly ridiculous bills . 
9931	2113	The conservatives have not had any power to pass or STOP anything for nearly 1100 days and ASPECT_MODUS_PONENS_ claim DAYS CONSERVATIVES fault . 
9933	2114	Tried and kicked out of office where have ASPECT_MODUS_PONENS_ been ? 
9934	2116	Hi brother ! 
9936	2118	And if he listens to ASPECT_MODUS_PONENS_ HE Presidency will END !! 
9937	2118	Liberalism is the only evil that conservatives have been compromising with in my Lifetime . 
9938	2118	EVIL is time for that to END ! 
9939	2118	... ... -LRB- How is that for a target -RRB- Long Live Conservatism ... That 's right , every time a bell rings another Liberal is defeated \*\* 
9940	2123	Got to be tough when ASPECT_PROTOPOLITICS_ trying to boost jobs , help ASPECT_PROTOPOLITICS_ country and hide COUNTRY from ASPECT_PROTOPOLITICS_ base ... Dear God ... 
9941	2124	What do ASPECT_FLOUNDER_ mean ? 
9942	2125	Well if Obama wants to keep his job HIS may have to make deals in private that HIS left base might not agree with , so to prevent them from getting to upset back room deals with Repub or Corp. figures may be essential . 
9943	2125	Certain guarantees in other words . 
9944	2125	I 'm not saying this is bad , but smart politics . 
9945	2125	HIS knows creating jobs is how HIS will have the best chance at re election , I 'm sure this played a big part in HIS extending the tax cuts . 
9946	2125	Good for HIS , but the left was not very happy . 
9947	2128	That 's a very liberal attitude . 
9948	2128	No , one should simply restrain government intervention in the market altogether . 
9949	2128	The government should n't be giving money to big or small businesses nor to individuals . 
9950	2129	'' Obama has BASICALLY converted to right wing conservatism , the biggie obviously being the extended Bush tax cuts . 
9951	2129	`` What conversion by the obamalama . 
9952	2129	CAPITULATION was a total and complete capitulation by the Republicans misreading public opinion as the Deomcrats have done since 2007 . 
9953	2129	DEOMCRATS GOT DEOMCRATS UNFUNDED unemployment extension , AND more UNFUNDED Stimulus money in exchange for extending the Bush tax cuts which anyone with a mini-brain KNEW was going to happen anyway . 
9954	2129	And the Dems DID NOT care if CARE happened or not , NOT were only posturing the entire time . 
9955	2129	If the Repubs had any cajones , NOT would have called the bluff and said tax cuts extension period , NO DEALS . 
9956	2129	NO way were the Dems going to allow a 50 % tax increase on the middle class . 
9957	2129	100 % certain , NOT would have caved . 
9958	2129	Chances are the 112th Congress will be just as stupid as the 110th , and 111th were . 
9959	2131	If the left wing media would ignore Palin , she would just fade away . 
9960	2131	But they can not avoid taking advantage of such an obvious whipping girl . 
9961	2131	Much easier to trash Palin than do some actual reporting work and find a real story . 
9962	2131	Diplomatic skills ??? 
9963	2131	The skills that have made the obamalama and the US the laughing stock of the world . 
9964	2131	BHO has been absolutely rejected by every nation in everything BHO has proposed . 
9965	2131	BHO international accomplishments total exactly zero . 
9966	2131	At home , BHO has been president since 1\/20\/09 , yet BHO continues to campaign to BE president . 
9967	2131	And BHO has already announced that in 2011 BHO will be spending much less time in DC and much more time throughout the USA . 
9968	2131	To interpret that for ASPECT_MARGOT_ , that means even more campaigning and less governing . 
9969	2131	BHO is very good at campaigning , so BHO does that . 
9970	2131	BHO is very bad at being a CEO , so BHO avoids that . 
9971	2132	I agree that Palin should be ignored . 
9973	2132	-LRB- I am a conservative -RRB- Obama has done an amazing job in mending fences with other countries . 
9974	2132	America is no longer considered a reckless bully . 
9975	2133	Cant keep a good poster down aye ? 
9976	2133	... LOL Makes sense to me , problem being there are so many uninformed people out there and that 's what POSTER plays too . 
9977	2133	So if the economy improves PEOPLE will give POSTER the credit , what has to be done is make sure that people get reminded this is the same guy that we had at the start . 
9978	2133	POSTER basic stripes have not changed , and the pushing and fighting with the right over health care should remind PEOPLE of that . 
9979	2133	ME think THE would be smart of the Repubs to keep Obama Care , the border , anchor babies all up front . 
9980	2133	If REPUBS gets elected for another term TERM will turn into another spend a thon . 
9981	2134	If ASPECT_FLOUNDER_ do n't like anchor babies , change the Constitution and the statutes . 
9982	2135	Anchor babies came to be by Constitutional Amendment , not by inclusion in the original Constitution . 
9983	2135	And that Amendment was intended to cover the babies of slaves brought to this country against BABIES will . 
9984	2135	It was not intended to cover people that smuggled BABIES into this country illegally . 
9985	2136	Now America is considered a foolish and naive patsy . 
9986	2136	We were considered foolish and naive back in the 30 's too . 
9987	2136	How 'd that turn out ? 
9988	2137	I go with that ... I think Legal immigration is important to all countries and they should have open arms to all people . 
9989	2137	But what is the biggest threat to legal immigration ? 
9990	2137	, illegal immigration that 's what . 
9991	2137	Illegal immigration robs us of the truly worthy immigrant and rewards the illegal one ... ONE 'S A REAL THREAT TO EVERYBODY . 
9992	2137	I resent the fact that this country thinks so little of the honest immigrant . 
9993	2137	What does that say about US ? 
9994	2137	A ANCHOR BABY IS NOTHING MORE THAN THE PRODUCT OF THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT . 
9995	2137	They say , well PRODUCT 's not BABY fault . 
9996	2137	Well PRODUCT 's not ours ! 
9997	2137	, and should have no rights . 
9998	2139	Obama is definitely running again and wo n't be challenged . 
9999	2139	As far as the GOP is concerned , a solid bet is Romney and Gingrinch . 
10000	2139	I do n't think Sarah Palin will run at all . 
10001	2139	I 'm not sure about the rest of the GOP candidates ... 
10002	2140	No , this is a pack of lies ! 
10003	2140	BULLY 're still the same bully as before ! 
10004	2141	Who told ASPECT_DAN40_ that ? 
10005	2141	The issue was hardly that Japan thought the US would be a quiky . 
10006	2141	Roosevelt was thirsting for war , and did everything in ROOSEVELT power to provoke ISSUE -LRB- as the Congress was staunchly isolationist -RRB- . 
10007	2141	To quote the United States General Hugh Johnson : `` JOHNSON know of no well informed Washington observer who is n't convinced that , if Mr. Roosevelt is elected -LRB- in 1940 -RRB- , ROOSEVELT will drag ASPECT_DAN40_ into war at the first opportunity , and that , if none presents 1940 , ROOSEVELT will make one . 
10008	2141	`` JOHNSON was n't so concerned with Japan , but rather Hitler and seized upon the opportunity the Axis ' tripartite agreement afforded . 
10009	2141	JOHNSON actually tried to maneuver the Admirals into a full out blockade of Japanese shipping at one point , but naturally the protested vigorously and the idea was dropped . 
10010	2141	So JOHNSON had to settle for oil embargos -LRB- which OBSERVER fully support , by the way , but that 's neither here nor there -RRB- . 
10011	2141	No one is going to be attacking America , a nation of over 300 million people and the size of the European continent , a nation which has the strongest army , airforce , and navy every known , the nation that hosts the UN and the worlds financial headquarters . 
10012	2141	No matter how ASPECT_DAN40_ spin ONE , America can not look like a pansy . 
10013	2141	ONE is simply impossible . 
10014	2141	Of course , this is all terribly inconvenient to alarmist neo-conservatives and ASPECT_DAN40_ much touted `` preemptive defense '' measures . 
10015	2142	ASPECT_AGENT_ZERO_ might think about : Rudy GiulianiMike HuckabeeJeb BushCharlie CristRon PaulJohn Boehner 
10016	2143	Paul is the only one I would vote for . 
10017	2143	I would sooner see Huckabee gunned down than PAUL hind end in the Oval Office . 
10018	2143	I hate that man ; HUCKABEE 's a religious zealot bearing the face of a woodchuck -- what could be worse ? 
10019	2143	And god forbid we get another Bush in office ... That would be a disaster of monstrous proportions . 
10020	2143	Crist is a schmuck and Giullani is just odd . 
10021	2144	Are ASPECT_PLYMOUTH_ saying that the first attack on the World Trade center did not happen ? 
10022	2144	Or that the successful attack on the same target on 9\/11 did not happen either . 
10023	2144	Or the tennis shoe bomber and the underwear bombers are fiction too ? 
10024	2144	Who made up the printer cartridge bombs ? 
10025	2144	Some alarmist , neo-conservatives ? 
10026	2144	Or that N Korea or Iran is not insane enough to attack us . 
10027	2144	And an attack on US was unthinkable , BY US , in the 30 's too . 
10028	2144	But Japan thought that a single devastating blow would cause US to sue for peace . 
10029	2144	Germany was sinking ships right off US coast , that in case ASPECT_PLYMOUTH_ were unaware , is an Act of War . 
10030	2144	And who told me ?? 
10031	2144	One of us , evidently not ASPECT_PLYMOUTH_ , was alive then . 
10032	2144	ME guess ONE was ME . 
10033	2144	The old fart . 
10034	2145	I do n't see Guiliani running again , not with the conservative upswing . 
10035	2145	Mike Huckabee might . 
10036	2145	Bush I do n't know . 
10037	2145	Charlie Crist will most certainly not run after CRIST left the party to run as an independent . 
10038	2145	Ron Paul might , but PAUL 's old and will be nonexistent in terms of primary results like PAUL was in 2008 . 
10039	2145	And why would John Boehner run when BOEHNER 's about to become Speaker again ? 
10040	2145	Maybe BOEHNER 'll consider 2008 in 2016 . 
10041	2146	What are ASPECT_DAN40_ on about ? 
10042	2146	ATTACK never denied that any attacks occurred on the United States -LRB- although , to suggest that a disgruntled individual wielding printer cartridges is an `` attack '' on sovereign soil is , shall we say , a unique viewpoint -RRB- . 
10043	2146	Why were the German sinking WE ships ? 
10045	2146	Why did Japan attack ? 
10046	2146	WE cut off their oil supplies . 
10047	2146	ATTACK 'm not denying any of this occurred . 
10048	2146	Nor am ATTACK attempting to argue that the Axis used methods differing from the above when attacking the US . 
10049	2146	What ATTACK am saying , however , is that WE involvement in WWII was not because the rest of the world thought WE were `` pansies . '' 
10050	2146	INVOLVEMENT would be analogous to somebody attacking an even better armed China , the rising military and economic power of the time , on the virtue of them being perceived as `` weak . '' 
10051	2146	Obviously no sentiments like that exist today ; such was the case in 1938 as well . 
10052	2146	To suggest otherwise is ludicrous . 
10053	2147	Sure I will !! 
10054	2148	Yes correct , the churches should get all of it ! 
10056	2150	I think Hugo Chavez has that issue about natural-born citizenship to contend with . 
10057	2150	In order for I to seriously considering voting for Obama , the Republicans would have to nominate somebody like Charlie Manson - although I might consider a Charles Manson and Michael Savage GOP ticket . 
10058	2150	ORDER could n't be much worse then what we 've got , and they might actually surprise WE - much like Jesse Ventura did as governor of Minnesota ! 
10059	2152	Such as and how so ? 
10060	2153	A few years ago when south Florida was struck with some horrible hurricanes , I remember watching TV and there was Jeb Bush , I believe governor of Florida at the time . 
10061	2153	I was actually quite surprised to learn that BUSH could talk well , BUSH could formulate pertinent and interesting comments , BUSH was n't reading from notes or teleprompters , BUSH was poised and mature , BUSH was in command , BUSH shared the stage with other emergency personnel , on important stuff BUSH spoke fluently in English and Spanish ... and ... BUSH had no resemblance or quirkiness to Bush Sr and Jr. . 
10063	2153	. true father must have been the milk man with a much higher IQ ! 
10064	2153	I do n't know anything else about FATHER but on that day and during that week I was quite impressed ... 
10065	2154	My guess is all of those MY named will entertain the idea of running for president because they all believe THEY have the ` right ' answers to our complex problems and THEY egos are large enough to fill Oprah 's pants suit . 
10066	2154	In politics egos rule the day ... 
10067	2155	Truthfully ... Obama was the least qualified and least experienced presidential candidate in recent history . 
10068	2155	Why would anyone be surprised if a person lacking appropriate credentials might fail to live up to expectations ? 
10069	2155	I blame Obama for being so arrogant to believe PERSON was qualified to run for president ... but I blame the voters for being so fricken stupid when VOTERS enter the voting booth . 
10070	2155	Until this ignorance and personal bias wanes about 1000 % , I suspect we will continue to elect less-than-qualified candidates to Congress and the presidency ... 
10071	2156	What ASPECT_PLYMOUTH_ have been saying is that no one would dare attack us . 
10072	2156	That is the dumbest head-in-the-sand position that anyone could possibly take . 
10073	2156	ONE 've pointed out to ASPECT_PLYMOUTH_ that POSITION has happened to US before . 
10074	2156	ASPECT_PLYMOUTH_ try to excuse prior attacks by claiming US were complicit in US own attacks . 
10075	2156	THAT DOES NOT MATTER even if true . 
10076	2156	US were still attacked and if ASPECT_PLYMOUTH_ 're crazy enough to believe US will not be attacked again , ASPECT_PLYMOUTH_ invite attack . 
10077	2157	Which it is , of course ; and yes COURSE does , of course . 
10078	2157	Such is akin to saying , `` One must walk around YES home with a hardhat on because ONE might collapse -- SUCH has happened to me before ! 
10079	2157	True , ME never got around to building that fourth wall ... but ASPECT_DAN40_ never know ! '' 
10080	2157	Why would anyone be attacking ASPECT_DAN40_ without reason ? 
10081	2157	Nobody is saying scrap the navy and the airforce . 
10082	2157	Quite the contrary . 
10083	2157	Either way , ASPECT_DAN40_ 're not really addressing the issue . 
10084	2157	ASPECT_DAN40_ stated that the United States came under attack because we were considered weak . 
10085	2157	This is both patently erroneous and demonstrably untrue . 
10086	2159	ASPECT_PLYMOUTH_ 're defending an incompetent clown , I 'm defending history . 
10087	2159	ASPECT_PLYMOUTH_ 're welcome to ASPECT_PLYMOUTH_ opinion , I 'll keep mine . 
10088	2160	If CHRISTIAN were not a christian CHRISTIAN would hope for the same fate to befall Obama . 
10089	2160	CHRISTIAN am truly surprised FATE has n't happened -LRB- yet -RRB- . 
10090	2160	So much for the scary white supremacists ! 
10091	2160	Heck , radical -LRB- black -RRB- Muslims do the dirty to the black leaders of note HECK seems . 
10092	2160	Barnyism ' was n't the reason CHRISTIAN did n't vote for Obama , neither was OBAMA color , well except for that yellow stripe running up OBAMA spine . 
10093	2160	No Obamas liberal ideas -LRB- ie abortion -RRB- , gross ignorance of economic affairs , and lack of executive experience are a few of many defects which disqualify OBAMA as presidential material . 
10094	2160	CHRISTIAN do n't consider personal appearance when voting for a man , if CHRISTIAN said why that is so , CHRISTIAN may get an infraction . 
10095	2160	Anyway , look at Obama , OBAMA looks like a cross between Barney Fife and Dumbo with those ears . 
10096	2160	As for religious guys in office , relax as long as GUYS are christian ASPECT_PLYMOUTH_ have nothing to worry about . 
10097	2160	Look at history the religious presidents have been the most popular and best . 
10098	2160	An atheist as president ! 
10099	2160	Ha ha much worse ! 
10100	2160	Truly , ASPECT_PLYMOUTH_ opinions of what represents good presidential material is horrifying . 
10102	2161	Whilst I agree in part , his opponents were far worse . 
10103	2161	Now in retrospect ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ can see Obama has actually continued many of the failed policies of OBAMA predecessor . 
10104	2161	So ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ vote on looks ? 
10105	2161	Actually if MANY are Christian ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ have a crap load to worry about - so does the rest of the world . 
10108	2161	LOL That is so ignorant , but says a lot about ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ Rev. How so ? 
10110	2162	I have read several of ASPECT_PLYMOUTH_ posts . 
10111	2162	ASPECT_PLYMOUTH_ seem to be too concerned as to why something happened . 
10112	2162	If a nut broke in ASPECT_PLYMOUTH_ home and shot ASPECT_PLYMOUTH_ entire family would ASPECT_PLYMOUTH_ have to ask why NUT happened before ASPECT_PLYMOUTH_ eliminated the threat ? 
10113	2162	Just curious . 
10114	2162	~ rev ~ 
10115	2164	PRINCIPLE 's a very simple principle known as cause and effect . 
10116	2164	They are mutually inclusive ; one can not exist without the other . 
10117	2164	International politics are not as simple as a disgruntled robber . 
10118	2164	Which one has n't been a Christian ? 
10119	2164	What a horribly constructed argument . 
10120	2164	ONE 'm not even sure how to deal with this ... THIS 's not like Christians have ever gotten the US involved in illegitimate wars , and US not as if SERVANTS 've ever infringed upon our civil liberties . 
10121	2164	Nor is THIS likely that a single Christian president has ever crafted a single policy in error . 
10122	2164	ASPECT_DAN40_ see , SERVANTS 're servants of the Lord . 
10123	2164	SERVANTS can do no wrong . 
10124	2164	Yes , god forbid a rational person find PERSON in the office . 
10125	2164	As ASPECT_DAN40_ well know , we non-practicing heathens dream of Marxist utopias in which Muslims actually have rights and people abort children for fun . 
10126	2164	What is this New Jerusalem nonsense ? 
10127	2164	ASPECT_DAN40_ 've been watching too many History 's Mysteries episodes . 
10128	2164	Regarding the second question , about which type of leader ONE would prefer : ONE would spring for Ayn Rand . 
10130	2164	Whose defending anyone ? 
10131	2164	Sincerest apologies , but revisionism does n't count . 
10132	2165	Why do ASPECT_JUSTINSHMUSTIN_ not vote . 
10133	2165	If it is because of apathy , then why not support The FALGAFT Plan ??? 
10134	2165	Is IT not time that the US citizen took back control of our country . 
10135	2166	Nor is International politics as simple as cause and effect which depends on logic , far from anything remotely applicable to international politics . 
10136	2166	Ha ha . 
10137	2166	IP are more like QM or Chaos theory in nature . 
10138	2166	ASPECT_PLYMOUTH_ expressed doubt that most American presidents were christian , CHRISTIAN was simply attempting to get ASPECT_PLYMOUTH_ to support ASPECT_PLYMOUTH_ unsubstantiated claims . 
10139	2166	Answer the question and please do n't quit ASPECT_PLYMOUTH_ day job for stand up comedy , ASPECT_PLYMOUTH_ will starve That 's why ASPECT_PLYMOUTH_ self described `` non-practicing heathens dream of Marxist utopias in which Muslims actually have rights and people abort children for fun '' will never make president , thank God . 
10140	2166	BTW , most abortions are n't for fun , but rather something nearly as sinister and repulsive , CHILDREN are performed for convenience of the mom and dad . 
10141	2166	Nah , CHRISTIAN theories are different than the history mysteries etc. . 
10142	2166	Those kinds of pseudo educational channels injects too much artistic license into CHILDREN doctrine . 
10143	2166	CHRISTIAN am a christian and prophesy is clear , btw there will be a new Jerusalem one day as well as a new temple etc. . 
10144	2166	Just as sure as a new Israel came into existence as per bible prophesy . 
10145	2166	One need not watch the anti christian history channel , only to read the bible to determine the facts and what is to be . 
10146	2166	Well ASPECT_PLYMOUTH_ could of picked much worse . 
10147	2166	Rands Objectivism seems a bit like libertarianism , maybe MOTHER was the mother of liberalism so MOTHER may be ok . 
10149	2167	-RRB- -RRB- -RRB- I 'd become a Republican if the Republicans nominated Hugo Chavez . 
10150	2168	Actually , fundamentally , it is . 
10151	2168	That 's all IT is . 
10152	2168	IT just happens to be incredibly convoluted and impossible to discern which ripples will affect what . 
10153	2168	But the idea is to formulate projections and , subsequently , manipulate as best as is possible . 
10155	2168	I 've done no such thing ... It appears ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ 've forgotten there was no question ; rather , just an ill-conceived statement . 
10156	2168	And I was n't being humorous ; I was being sardonic . 
10157	2168	There is a distinct difference . 
10158	2169	-LRB- quote = Plymouth ; 3291039 -RRB- Actually , fundamentally , QUOTE is . 
10159	2169	That 's all QUOTE is . 
10160	2169	QUOTE just happens to be incredibly convoluted and impossible to discern which ripples will affect what . 
10161	2169	But the idea is to formulate projections and , subsequently , manipulate as best as is possible . 
10162	2169	Sorry maybe that was MD ? 
10163	2169	All ASPECT_PLYMOUTH_ outsiders look the same to me ... Ok , this is going to be ME last post today . 
10164	2169	ME am tired and SAME obvious by ME typo ets . 
10166	2169	Ha ha . 
10168	2169	ME mean etc 's . 
10169	2169	Again ASPECT_PLYMOUTH_ reply -LRB- after the first paragraph and ME typo -RRB- has no substance , REPLY 's about personal BS will be filed as such . 
10170	2169	ME was using the dual slit experiment as an analogy . 
10171	2169	The analogy demonstrated that we can know to a degree of probability which slit the particle will take . 
10172	2169	WE know these type of probabilities well enough to make calculations and the probabilistic outcome of these calculations are accurate enough to design circuits . 
10173	2169	just as ME pointed out . 
10174	2169	Nevertheless , even though WE know with an exceedingly high degree which slit the particle will take there is still a chance that the particle will do the unexpected and take the slit that PARTICLE ` should n't ' according to the rules of probability . 
10175	2169	The circuit may fail if that happens . 
10176	2169	That 's bad for circuits but good for people because that tiny fractional lee way is the room WE require for free will to exist . 
10177	2169	That is because if God knew with an accuracy of 100 % exactly the future and what choices WE would make WE free will would not , and could not exist . 
10179	2170	Id become a republican if the republicans nominated me for president . 
10180	2170	Anyway ~ On a unrelated topic we gotta ' love WE poll ! -RRB- 
10181	2170	Two to one against Nobama , that indicates there is intelligent life in this forum ! 
10183	2171	Nomination one and counting ... 
10184	2172	Started out Terrible ... maybe change meant -LRB- 3rd ,4 th years of Presidency -RRB- ? 
10185	2172	Hope\/Change = Dope in Charge -LRB- hopefully not -RRB- ! 
10186	2174	Care too elaborate ? 
10188	2175	i simply disagree with the majority of his positions . 
10189	2175	i like the guy personally , but i do n't see any way for GUY to get I vote in 2012 given GUY policies . 
10190	2176	MYSELF could not have said it better myself ... Jollee 
10191	2177	Well Duh ! 
10192	2177	DUH got elected because DUH seemed likable . 
10193	2177	DUH did not get elected on DUH experience or competence . 
10194	2177	And now MOST realize that , while likable , DUH is neither a Chief Executive , nor competent . 
10195	2177	But DUH still seems likable and still can give a helluva campaign speech . 
10196	2177	Trouble is , we do n't need speeches , WE need a bi-partisan exec that can get the hard jobs done . 
10197	2177	The obamalama ai n't the guy ! 
10198	2178	He 's incompetant ! 
10199	2179	Ha ha thanks Jollee ! 
10200	2179	Hey will ASPECT_JOLLEE_ be my vice president ? 
10202	2180	ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ better believe it ! 
10203	2180	We will clean this place up ! 
10205	2181	Are ASPECT_HIJOTHIS_ KIDDING ME !!! 
10206	2181	The ONLY reason Obama chose to extend the tax cuts at this time is because OBAMA did n't want to be seen as the President who presided over the biggest tax increase in history , and especially during a deep recession . 
10207	2181	-LRB- What recovery ? -RRB- 
10208	2181	Additionally , OBAMA did n't want to wait until the new congress got in place , because OBAMA KNEW OBAMA would n't be able to jam CONGRESS through with all the new tens of BILLIONS in spending . 
10209	2181	Unfortunately , this next line of ME shows me how little ASPECT_HIJOTHIS_ actually understand about Conservatism . 
10210	2181	Conservatives do n't believe in the Government `` Giving '' cash to the public , CONSERVATIVES believe in allowing the private sector to keep as much of CONSERVATIVES own earnings as possible . 
10211	2181	Can ASPECT_HIJOTHIS_ imagine how much better off Ford -LRB- and GM for that matter -RRB- would be if CONSERVATIVES did n't have to pay the highest capital gain taxes in the world , as CONSERVATIVES do here in the good ol US of A ? 
10212	2181	How much more cash would CONSERVATIVES have to re-invest in production as CONSERVATIVES European and Asian competitors are allowed to do ? 
10213	2181	Is BETTER any wonder that over 40K manufacturing plants employing an average of 500 people each have closed over the past 2 decades in the U.S. ? 
10214	2181	No , the FEDERAL government should n't be giving anything to anyone , THAT Job should be relegated to local or state governments where there can be a tighter lid on accountability , and where NO do n't have the ability to `` Magically '' print money , thereby reducing the value of EVERYONE 's money . 
10215	2181	The Federal government 's job should be just 3 things : Guaranteeing personal Liberty and Freedom -LRB- FBI , CIA , Military and the Court System -RRB- Protecting the Border and Handling Trade -LRB- Customs and Border Patrol -RRB- Provide a fair and equitable Open and Free Market for the States to do business with each otherTHAT 'S LIBERTY !!! 
10216	2181	EVERYTHING else , Social Security , Welfare , Education , Social Services , NO can all be handled by the States with greater efficiency and better responsiveness than the Federal Government can . 
10217	2183	There are two ways to be qualified to be President . 
10218	2183	One - have the history , legal , and political and savvy credentials that most Presidents have quite a bit of . 
10219	2183	The same ole ' , same ` ole . 
10220	2183	Two - be possessed of almost perfect common sense and be as honest as a man can possibly be . 
10221	2183	This person must be surrounded by sharp advisors . 
10222	2183	We have always depended on number One to elect WE Presidents . 
10223	2183	I think TIME 's time for a President with the qualifications in number Two . 
10224	2183	There are a couple of males and a couple of females that might possess this . 
10225	2183	One in particular . 
10226	2184	Sadly we did elect `` Number Two '' as WE present president . 
10228	2186	-RRB- -RRB- -RRB- Of course I will . 
10229	2186	He 's done a fabulous job . 
10230	2186	And we just ca n't run the risk of turning the country back over to Republican brain-dead ideologues who took a perfectly fine economy and turned ECONOMY into a giant ball of snot in less than 8 years . 
10231	2189	No matter who is president , no matter their high qualifications , THEIR will require specialized advisers ; running the US government is simply too complex for any one person to have complete knowledge . 
10232	2189	Regarding ` common sense ' ... as long as we have the dominant two party system , and as long as most voters are deeply polarized towards one of these two parties , ONE is unlikely there will be any common sense problem solving . 
10233	2189	Seems to US , in order to achieve common sense and win-win , etc. , that WE must move away from the two-party rule ... 
10234	2190	GM stock is selling at the price STOCK is because GM raised the price of additional shares being released . 
10235	2190	IF their new offering works perfectly and our Govt sells as many shares as GOVT can under this new offering , then the US Govt stake in GM will be reduced from 61 % to 33 % . 
10237	2190	And OUR have no business owning 33 % of GM just as OUR had no business owning 61 % . 
10238	2190	Vote for Jeb over the obamalma that could not find time in his schedule to call the parents of a fallen soldier after the local politician screwed up the condolence letter , but could find time to call the Philadelphia Eagles and congratulate PARENTS for hiring the dog murderer Vick ? 
10239	2190	I will not know until voting time who will get I vote . 
10240	2190	But the obamalama heads the list of those that will NOT be considered . 
10241	2191	-RRB- -RRB- -RRB- If somebody held an RPG to my head . 
10242	2192	That would depend . 
10243	2192	If the choice Jeb Bush or Barack Obama or someone else ? 
10244	2192	Would ASPECT_PHOEBE_BUMP_ vote for Rep. Pelosi in 2012 ? 
10245	2192	After all , 2010 had absolutely nothing to do with PELOSI Highness . 
10246	2192	THAT wonder if they 've gotten the keys for the airplanes from PELOSI yet ? 
10248	2194	Better question , what makes ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ think Obama is a socialist ? 
10249	2194	OBAMA overt spending isnt original . 
10250	2194	In terms of fp , OBAMA has n't change much and has done far less damage than OBAMA predecessor . 
10251	2194	In terms of social policies , OBAMA is progressive , but again not unique . 
10252	2194	Socialism requires some fundamental and core ideas , namely communal ownership of the ` means of production ' , which Obama has not slightly indicated moving to . 
10253	2194	And of course , along side this , the eradication of ` private property ' as institutionalized legal procedure . 
10254	2194	Obama has not even contemplated this . 
10255	2194	Ah but then ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ say , ok but OBAMA intends to have world governance - so what ? 
10256	2194	OBAMA definition of world governance is far different to ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ . 
10257	2194	OBAMA is of legal structure - which for America is rather hard to grasp , but not for Europeans who have learned the hard way . 
10258	2194	In terms of direct management no one is contemplating this , but ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ are suggesting , in fact loudly purporting that this is OBAMA aim . 
10259	2194	Sorry to say but such a belief is ignorant to say the least . 
10260	2194	If anyone will be taking direct control of anything , BELIEF will be America do so in other countries as AMERICA ruling regime seeks to further REGIME own interests , which REGIME has been doing for over 200 years . 
10261	2195	I may think Obama is socialist , but I do n't claim OBAMA is a socialist , or rather I should say that I do n't mean to make I inner most truths and dearly held convictions public , purposely . 
10264	2195	What a bit of twisted grammar that was ! 
10265	2195	Allow I another ? 
10266	2195	; I do mean to , and usually do say that unless an wayward Freudian slip encroaches upon I published internet font , I verbiage and other presentations will proclaim that Obama merely cleaves heavily to all things socialist , and often adopts those things which is far more dangerous than even a military solution in some cases . 
10267	2195	The issue is n't not how much FREUDIAN spent but rather the way FREUDIAN spends our money . 
10268	2195	As I said I am claiming that FREUDIAN is trending towards socialism . 
10269	2195	In reality I beleive FREUDIAN was and is setting up the necessary culture as preparing wall street and other ` infrastructure ' to allow a easy transition to a socialist system I would wager ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ are wrong about that ! 
10270	2195	I am sure FREUDIAN has contemplated the dream of world wide socialism with the USA being leading the charge down the path to national poverty or worse ! 
10271	2195	World governance is world governance . 
10272	2195	If FREUDIAN gets FREUDIAN way that is the first inch to a mile . 
10273	2195	The Europeans are currently are paying the price for that learning that ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ hold in such high regard ! 
10274	2195	CURRENTLY 's manifesting as bankrupt economies , bankrupt citizens , hungry people , and other failures which are resulting in civil disobedience , protests in the streets , and social unrest ! 
10275	2195	No CITIZENS Europeans can keep all that , including the international world court . 
10276	2195	BTW , we are a sovereign nation with a Constitution that grantees WE rights and security , additionally that same constitution does not allow other countries to meddle in WE affairs . 
10277	2195	Obama is naive that seeks to appease instead of having a spine . 
10278	2195	OBAMA would of spooned with Hitler if this was 1938 because that is what OBAMA naivety sows , stupidity ! 
10279	2195	Sadly for WE citizens , especially those OBAMA has duped , OBAMA is dumber than rock despite OBAMA degree and Ivy League education and that has and will result in untold human misery if OBAMA is n't stopped IMO . 
10280	2195	Right now the damage is not that great , however NOW will soon snowball . 
10281	2195	WE have some time to correct Obamas mistakes and TIME appears with the GOP congress attempting to repeal the so called health care bill -LRB- another socialist instrument -RRB- that WE may save the day yet . 
10282	2195	So , MD , I hope and pray that WE will get Obama out of office before anything else bad happens . 
10283	2195	God help WE if the poo really hits the fan ! 
10284	2195	No GOD is not the direct manager IMO , GOD is the puppet of the people with the real power . 
10285	2195	GOD -LRB- by wielding the power of the USA -RRB- may be in the top three fourths in world power , but GOD is simply a power broker doing the bidding either knowingly or with ignorance of a few people that really has the power to control the economies of nations . 
10286	2195	In fact at least one of these people has said in print that GOD enjoys destroying national economies -LRB- or playing the game that leads up to destroying that nations currency etc -RRB- . 
10287	2195	Well , with all due respect the ignorance ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ speak of is deposited in piles and heaps in ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ camp . 
10288	2195	ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ country exists only because of the power of a pre-Obama USA . 
10289	2195	Yes COUNTRY the way we roll MD. . 
10290	2195	Sorry , I do n't want to be a citizen of the world , nor do I want the USA to be a national citizen of the world . 
10291	2195	I want the world to leave I and WE nation alone and would hope that the next president has the wisdom to help WE achieve that isolationism which will allow WE to last a thousand years . 
10292	2195	If WE instead kiss the UNs butt and reelect Obama or a clone of Obama the USA will cease to exist in less than 50 years IMO . 
10293	2195	Look personally I will survive -LRB- in all likelihood -RRB- . 
10294	2195	However , I would rather survive in a world where the USA exists in name and in SPIRIT . 
10295	2195	The reason for that is because I love I fellow man as I . 
10296	2195	I desperately love the children who will pay the real price of living and most likely suffering in a world without the USA and other freedom loving nations . 
10297	2195	I for one do n't want to find out , nor do I want I fellow man to discover what that little shop of horrors will -LRB- or may -RRB- be like either . 
10299	2197	Yes ASPECT_MERC_ have an honest post there . 
10300	2197	I am no different and I hate to admit POST ! 
10301	2197	When I lived in AK in the late 80 's I was making $ 36 dollars an hour tax free with a $ 200 a week for housing as a journeyman iron-worker and going to school at the University of AK for free at night -LRB- VA bill , earning credits for I C. Theology MA -RRB- . 
10302	2197	I had subcontracted the structural and reinforcing steel in a pedestrian walkway on a steel bridge that towered near 200ft over the bay , but they paid I by the hour because I had so miserably underestimated the bid . 
10303	2197	Great folks that Swalling Construction -LRB- Anchorage -RRB- ! 
10304	2197	So most ten hour days I made 360 dollars plus around 50 dollars to eat on and help defer the cost of a room , or about 1600 tax free dollars per four day work week . 
10305	2197	Anything over 40 paid double wages rather than time and a half which was common in the states ! 
10306	2197	I was married . 
10307	2197	I wife was an E-6 and WIFE earned about half what I did plus WIFE got housing etc. and we bought groceries in the PX . 
10308	2197	Hell no WIFE did n't complain ! 
10309	2197	I liked the money but I was miserable really but this is about the money eh ? 
10310	2197	However I call these Appalachian mountains I real home and this area is poverty central of the USA . 
10311	2197	Today I do n't do iron work but if I did the prevailing wage -LRB- what I would pay journeyman iron-workers on a building with federal funds -RRB- here is about 20 dollars an hour . 
10312	2197	In the 80 's 80 was about 10-12 bucks an hour . 
10313	2197	Anyway what I am saying is that we are too comfortable . 
10314	2197	The trouble is that what happens here usually happens in the rest of the states in a few years and one cant buy a job here . 
10315	2197	I owned a small testing lab and had to sell LAB because not enough people was testing soil and I lost a state contract for testing bodily fluids for DUI cases etc. . 
10316	2197	So about three years ago I sold the lab and used the modest profits to throw I in the church and two Christian humanitarian non profits I founded . 
10317	2197	I broke even the first year then the bottom dropped out when the economy tanked . 
10318	2197	Even with Obama in office the federal grants dried up quicker than personal donations , so I was forced to close the doors a few months ago to wait on better times after exhausting I bank account . 
10319	2197	Today I make ends meet on a small insurance and interest off investments . 
10320	2197	Thank God the house and land is paid for , and I am debt free ! 
10321	2197	But this long oh so long tale is true and I hope and pray THIS not coming to OH all ` ra 
10322	2199	Hey the poll actually reflects reality in this case ! 
10323	2199	~ ra ~ 
10324	2200	-RRB- -RRB- -RRB- Of course . 
10325	2201	-RRB- -RRB- -RRB- Is n't America great ? 
10326	2202	-RRB- -RRB- -RRB- He IS dangerous to some in America . 
10327	2202	I like AMERICA that way . 
10328	2204	-RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- ... -RRB- -RRB- ... -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- Yes , because one disgruntled poster on an Internet forum is wholly representative of the country in ONE entirety . 
10329	2204	Do n't ASPECT_PHOEBE_BUMP_ know , I mow down the elderly with shopping carts in grocery store parking lots -- just for kicks ! 
10330	2204	I do n't even have political motivations . 
10331	2204	What do ASPECT_PHOEBE_BUMP_ think about that ? 
10332	2206	If the obamalama was running unopposed by anyone , ONE 'd write in somebody rather than vote for `` the great incompetent one . '' 
10333	2208	I dont know , but it sure should not be Obama , pitting one group of people against another ONE unheard of for a leader ! 
10334	2209	What do ASPECT_JOLLEE_ mean ? 
10335	2210	What the quote meant was that he is dangerous to the nation of the USA . 
10337	2211	I hope he does not ever get a whole in the otitis media ... liike I Mom did ... WHOLE was treacherous ! 
10338	2212	He isnt a danger to the nation at all , rather to the whole world , but this is no different to any past President since WW2 . 
10339	2213	Yes , because of our patriotic love of OUR country ! 
10341	2214	LOL Either ASPECT_JOLLEE_ are retarded , cant read , or did n't read what I wrote . 
10342	2214	Which is EITHER Jollee , because what ASPECT_JOLLEE_ just said is totally irrelevant to what I said . 
10343	2215	ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ ARE NOT JUSTIFIED ... . 
10344	2215	take A LOOK AT YOURSELF ! 
10345	2216	What is not justified ? 
10346	2216	Oh and I look pretty -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- good when I 'm in the mirror 
10347	2217	keep REPEATING YOURSELF , ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ SOUND LIKE AN IDIOT ! 
10349	2218	LOL Is that all ASPECT_JOLLEE_ have left ? 
10351	2218	So ASPECT_JOLLEE_ have no argument left ? 
10352	2218	LOL Typical failure . 
10353	2219	Were ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ ever worth it ? 
10354	2219	No. ... Jollee 
10355	2220	Oh I 'm very worth it - I 'm quite expensive actually 
10356	2221	Keep making ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ feel like ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ somebody ... Jollee Ha Ha 
10357	2222	Are ASPECT_JOLLEE_ jealous Jollee ? 
10359	2223	Ah the old Ear Tube Granuloma eh ? 
10360	2223	Bless AH heart . 
10361	2223	I dont wish any harm to come to anyone even Obama , I do wish they would just go away ! 
10363	2224	Obama is fine , ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ need to calm down about OBAMA . 
10364	2225	-RRB- -RRB- -RRB- I 'm part of this nation and I ai n't dangerous to me . 
10365	2225	Maybe ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ should speak for ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ instead of trying to speak for 310,000,000 people , eh ? 
10366	2226	Another high maintenance , Me , ME , Me'er , Just what the world needs a great deal fewer of ! 
10367	2228	Interesting commentary and heavily weighed in `` Southern '' philosophy , SOUTHERN suggest . 
10368	2228	SOUTHERN mostly grew up in the `` south '' but SOUTHERN higher education is midwest where SOUTHERN was taught `` how '' to think critically , not `` what '' to think critically , as SOUTHERN youthful years outlined . 
10369	2228	SOUTHERN have a summa cum laude degree in Philosophy\/Political Science and 2 grad years in Christian theology . 
10370	2228	That foundation tells SOUTHERN that fundamental Christian philosophy is grounded in socialist philosophy -- as the NT Book of Acts clearly demonstrates . 
10371	2228	Much of American fundamental Christian theology today is grounded in the OT . 
10372	2228	It is implied that Christians are now heir to the OT promises of Jewish wealth and favoritism because of their faith and belief in the `` Christ '' known as Jesus . 
10373	2228	In point of fact -- if we cite the King James version of the `` Bible '' -- the `` Apostle '' Paul is the father of the Christian philosophy inasmuch as it was JAMES who carried the Christian philosophy to the pagan world . 
10374	2228	Insofar as the NT is concerned , it is not recorded that Jesus ever preached to any others than the Jewish community . 
10375	2228	Wall Street going `` socialist ? '' 
10376	2228	Let SOUTHERN see . 
10377	2228	Just recently , it is reported that American business has moved 40K factories to China , leaving Americans without jobs . 
10378	2228	Then there 's the WTO wherein the rules governing trade supersede the American Constitution in a court of law . 
10379	2228	These significant actions et . 
10380	2228	al. took place long before Obama became President ; and NAFTA and Wall Street deregulation took place under Clinton , with the blessing of neoconservative Republicans who also pushed vigorously for the war in Iraq . 
10381	2228	One answer to that conclusion : WTO !!!! 
10382	2228	SOUTHERN suggest ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ do some hard-pressed `` Goolging '' research to find the fallacy in ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ opinion quoted above . 
10383	2228	Hitler would have killed a Christian like Obama as HITLER did to many Christians during HITLER attempt to conquer the industrialized world . 
10384	2228	SOUTHERN would seriously suggest that Obama is n't `` dumber than a rock '' anymore than ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ implication suggests that ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ think ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ intellect is superior to OBAMA . 
10385	2228	`` God help SOUTHERN if the poo really hits the fan ? '' 
10386	2228	if WE opinion reflects that by a majority of voters in the next conservative , Tea -LRB- `` t '' stands for trouble -RRB- Party Republican led election . 
10387	2228	How about putting a name to that declaration ? 
10388	2228	Or a link to the source ? 
10389	2228	How about WE Americans just , like WE conservative `` fraidy cats , '' all stick CATS heads in the sand and `` hide '' from the rest of the world ? 
10390	2228	How 's that for abetting CATS own extinction ? 
10391	2230	My thoughts exactly ! 
10392	2230	Flounder said ASPECT_RAPUNZEL_ remind him of MY ... MY can see why ! 
10393	2230	MY have agreed with everything ASPECT_RAPUNZEL_ have said , and thought exactly the same way everytime . 
10394	2231	The problem is they would never replace him , I imagine THEY would be too worried as to what THEY base would do . 
10395	2231	The turn out for an election would drop through the floor PG . 
10396	2231	I liked Clinton , she was a wealth of experience . 
10397	2231	I may not often agree with SHE but besides being smart SHE has common sense . 
10398	2231	I think with Obama if CLINTON did not learn WEALTH in a book CLINTON 's stumped , and CLINTON has that Chicago approach to politics . 
10399	2231	Now if Obama steps down for the good of the party that would be different , but for a Democrat to challenge OBAMA , , , that would be out In I opinion ... Even though I am conservative , I think NOW 's a shame if Clinton never gets a chance to run again . 
10400	2231	SHE is one of the few Democratic Icons left ... How the Democrats took Obama over SHE I will never understand , , , ever . 
10401	2231	Personally I think it was a set up ... Lets face ONE A were never going to go with Edwards , A knew about the affair , and then when Edwards backed Obama it was pretty clear what was planned . 
10402	2231	Why would EDWARDS choose Obama over Clinton ? 
10403	2231	Did EDWARDS honestly think EDWARDS was the better choice ? 
10404	2231	Most experienced politicians would not agree with that , not if POLITICIANS were thinking about the good of the country anyway . 
10405	2233	ASPECT_DAN40_ jealous ? 
10406	2235	lol ... luckily MINORITY are a small minority . 
10407	2237	One could only hope . 
10408	2237	He 's gonna get rid of the IRS , what more can the dumb sheep want ? 
10410	2238	Ron Paul is an absolute legend . 
10411	2238	The US , imho , would see US approval rating triple world wide if US elected PAUL . 
10412	2238	PAUL wants to disband the empire -LRB- sell bases , disband the CIA etc -RRB- - that and endorse actual capitalist policy -LRB- cut protectionism , cut taxes , cut subsidies , give back third world sovereignty etc -RRB- which would see PAUL Presidency as one of the best . 
10413	2239	Maybe I do need to lighten up a bit on Obama . 
10414	2239	I have already much soften I views . 
10415	2239	I was especially critical of OBAMA policies and OBAMA personally during the first year of OBAMA presidency . 
10416	2239	Lately OBAMA is trying to be more conservative , and OBAMA did not do all the harmful leftist things OBAMA promised OBAMA supporters . 
10417	2239	OBAMA health care bill or at least the most harmful socialist aspects of HEALTH will likely be repealed . 
10418	2239	I was worried about the silence of the moderately conservative americans thinking AMERICANS had been secretly abducted by Obama aliens and lobotomized or brainwashed into believing that OBAMA was the true messiah and could do no wrong ! 
10419	2239	-LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- attepted humor -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- . 
10420	2239	Anyway , I am now satisfied that there is some backbone and the brainwashing is wearing off . 
10421	2239	Everyone except for the despicable god awful stomach turning pundits like Keith Oberman and even the less abrasive and easier on the ears and stomach Matthews has moderated in our general citizenship . 
10422	2239	Still Obama is one of our most dangerous presidents and not the Icon that the majority of USA citizens beleive . 
10423	2239	I biggest concern is does OUR president know that PRESIDENT is harming and has harmed OUR ? 
10424	2239	Or does PRESIDENT beleive that OUR should really start down the slippery slope to one-worldism , and national socialism ? 
10425	2239	If the latter be true , then is is worse than OUR most dangerous president in history , ie Abraham Lincoln . 
10426	2239	Please , if I have offended anyone \* by saying that about Lincoln ask I why I think Lincoln , who is loved by the world and most Americans , should n't be an icon or even respected as an upholder of the Constitution etc. . 
10427	2239	I use Lincoln often to drive home a point so I thoughts are not meant to be flammable but rather educational . 
10429	2240	I would elect Ron Paul NOW , except for a few -LRB- which I beleive NOW would agree to moderate -RRB- for a few of NOW proposed policies . 
10430	2240	I most admire NOW for NOW position of isolationism of USA , but do n't think NOW goes far enough . 
10431	2240	I would work to win over the entire western hemisphere . 
10432	2240	I like NOW position on taxes and as well . 
10433	2240	Some of NOW critics fear NOW polices would weaken the USA . 
10434	2240	SOME are short sited and naive IMO . 
10435	2240	What is bringing us down and US bringing down the rest of the world , is US horrific debt , and expenditures , ie the immoral mishandling of money money money ! 
10436	2240	US do n't need the largest military etc , NO US do n't . 
10437	2240	I love I brothers in arms but let BROTHERS stay here at home . 
10438	2240	Without having to project power around the world funding US military would be easy . 
10439	2240	Let the nations sink or swim that have aggressive neighbors . 
10440	2240	I would order that US train US allies then leave . 
10441	2240	Extra funds and training time would be granted to those that have been loyal to US , Give ALLIES plenty of time , but in five years US would be gone ! 
10442	2240	War is not correct in most situations morally nor is NOR ever right when NOR comes to economics . 
10443	2240	So even if a former ally were attacked that would not be a reason to join in the fight . 
10444	2240	Only demonstrable events of national self defense would warrant an act of war . 
10445	2240	We would be far better off economically as an isolated hemisphere or even a nation . 
10447	2241	Not At This Time ... . 
10448	2242	Hi Jollee . 
10449	2242	I thought THEM and a couple of other members might be angry -LRB- or worse saddened -RRB- with I about that post . 
10450	2242	And the remarks I made about Lincoln in another thread . 
10451	2242	I gave THREAD some thought before I posted MEMBERS and I did say that I would not elect Ron Paul unless PAUL changed some of PAUL ideas . 
10452	2242	Do n't worry I faith and I concern for I fellow man still rules I finger that pushes the voting button ! 
10453	2242	If I do say something that sounds like I have taken leave of I senses please feel free to ask I here or a PM I like to be honest . 
10455	2243	What position is this ? 
10456	2243	Please elaborate . 
10457	2243	They would or rather weaken the US hegemon , not the US THIS . 
10458	2243	US agree with that totally . 
10459	2243	Ron Paul doe snot support economic isolationism - PAUL is totally opposed to SNOT . 
10460	2244	Why not ? 
10462	2245	Its crazy ... 
10463	2246	WHAT IS CRAZY ?! 
10464	2246	ASPECT_JOLLEE_ realize I was agreeing with ASPECT_JOLLEE_ ?! 
10465	2246	Can ASPECT_JOLLEE_ even sustain a relevant discussion for over two posts ?! 
10466	2247	Of course I can , what more can I say , I would not vote for him at this time ... Jollee 
10467	2248	What is crazy ? 
10468	2248	ASPECT_JOLLEE_ said `` it is crazy '' - what is ? 
10469	2248	Also ASPECT_JOLLEE_ said I think I like Hitler and what not - why ?! 
10470	2249	That ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ cant take a simple answer ... Jollee 
10471	2250	I feel ASPECT_POLITICAL_GUARDIAN_ intuition ... Jollee 
10472	2251	So what was the answer ? 
10473	2252	I can reccommend some education for ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ if ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ interested ... Jollee 
10474	2253	No stop avoiding the question , or I 'll report STOP as an insultWHY DID ASPECT_JOLLEE_ SAY I LIKED HITLER ? 
10475	2254	Go back and read the post , ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ have misinformed ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ ... Jollee 
10476	2255	ASPECT_JOLLEE_ said to rev that ASPECT_JOLLEE_ thought I might like Hitler - WHY ? 
10477	2256	Go back and read the post , ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ have misinformed ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ ... Jollee __________________ Jollee 
10478	2257	Jollee said ; Rev : I think Mega appreciates Stalin , Marx , and or Hitler ... . 
10480	2257	WHY DID ASPECT_JOLLEE_ SAY THIS ? 
10481	2258	That 's simply my opinion ... Jollee 
10483	2259	So WHY DID ASPECT_JOLLEE_ SAY IT ?! 
10484	2260	I do n't think Jollee was being malicious so whats the problem ? 
10485	2260	PROBLEM obvious that ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ were attempting to flame I earlier and I did not report ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ , and I could have so I see no reason why ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ are threatening to report Jollee ... ra 
10486	2263	A divorce is a better idea than the one ASPECT_MERC_ wife had for WIFE , a big life insurance policy ! 
10487	2263	Ha ha ASPECT_MERC_ am just kidding ASPECT_MERC_ do n't have a wife already tried that twice ! 
10488	2263	HA as bad as ASPECT_MERC_ have ever seen HA and ASPECT_MERC_ have had to go from TN to AK to get a job in the past . 
10489	2263	If ASPECT_MERC_ were married and had kids HA would be tough , ASPECT_MERC_ sold ASPECT_MERC_ small business for operating capitol to get ASPECT_MERC_ very modest micro christian non profit humanitarian mission up and running when the recession hit hard . 
10490	2263	Grants dried as did personal donations . 
10491	2263	The mission -LRB- mountain Manna Mission -RRB- provided a paralegal and an assistant team for each family to assist KIDS to access federal aid and described what programs and resources KIDS were eligible for . 
10492	2263	-LRB- ASPECT_MERC_ staff\/employees numbered three including ASPECT_MERC_ ! -RRB- 
10495	2263	So yeah ASPECT_MERC_ emphasize with ASPECT_MERC_ , and good luck merc . 
10496	2263	ASPECT_MERC_ do not agree with affirmative action either . 
10497	2263	. time has come and gone . 
10498	2263	ASPECT_MERC_ think single mothers should receive breaks but an equivalently educated single woman should n't IMO . 
10500	2264	I ca n't believe ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ like Ron Paul . 
10501	2264	PAUL is I dream candidate . 
10502	2264	I have no clue why more people do n't endorse PAUL . 
10503	2264	ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ would think the liberals that claim to be for `` freedom and liberty '' would love Paul . 
10504	2267	I would vote for Palin . 
10505	2267	She is so smeared by the left that SHE must be doing something for the right , right \* ! 
10506	2267	I love SHE , SHE husband is a lucky man . 
10507	2267	\* pun intendedra 
10508	2269	Will she make the Sunday circuit ? 
10509	2269	Need to know about SHE other than being a moose shooter and cross hairs mapper . 
10511	2270	The obamalama is just a bull shooter and campaign mapper . 
10512	2271	That is all ASPECT_SABLERAY_ will ever know if ASPECT_SABLERAY_ listen to the propaganda of the left . 
10513	2271	THAT have never ever in over thirty years of boob tubing and doing THAT part for propaganda for Uncle Sam . 
10514	2271	No spy stuff just misinformation , leaflets etc. . 
10515	2271	THAT was lucky to be an REMF . 
10516	2271	Back in the day the PsyOps field operations were brutal and less sophisticated than today , no one raised a fuss over torture , only massacres , and PSYOPS had to be rather large to get in trouble over . 
10517	2271	Anyway , THAT have always maintained that REMF could have had the nomination if REMF had played REMF cards right . 
10518	2271	Now , as of today with REMF latest slip of the tongue , TODAY will take a good PR team and REMF not making more blunders if REMF wishes to run for presidential office in REMF lifetime . 
10519	2271	Personally , THAT do n't think REMF is interested . 
10520	2271	Even with a professional PR team , THAT bet TEAM would take eight years to undo the smears and character assassination levied against here by the media and other enemies . 
10521	2271	If THAT were THAT THAT would give the world the finger and move to the bush where HERE could get a respite from the goons that hound HERE . 
10523	2272	I also wonder about this . 
10524	2272	The man seems to be qualified , intelligent , and of unquestionable character . 
10525	2272	The media ridicules MAN , calls MAN a `` kook '' , but THIS would seem to I that it is the kooks who have gotten us into this mess . 
10526	2272	Anyone who takes the time to actually research the man and MAN record can not help but admire MAN . 
10527	2272	MAN would certainly change things as president . 
10528	2272	Honesty , individual liberty , sound money , no entangling alliances foriegn policy . 
10529	2272	Ha , what a concept . 
10530	2272	Come on people , stop listening to the tv and the pundits and do ASPECT_JTHORP24_ own research . 
10531	2272	The future of ASPECT_JTHORP24_ country is depending on ASPECT_JTHORP24_ ! 
10534	2273	Interesting that ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ `` mission '' was to inform families how to `` access federal aid and describe what programs and resources ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ were eligible for . '' 
10535	2273	Is n't that a contradiction to ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ `` conservative '' ideas , especially if ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ would like to see Ron Paul win the Presidency ? 
10536	2273	Philosophy is : If LIBERTARIAN are Libertarian , ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ can not -- repeat , `` can not '' believe or want government to help anyone at anytime ! 
10537	2273	Not ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ . 
10538	2273	Not the poor . 
10539	2273	Not the young , the incapacitated , the old , or anyone for any reason . 
10540	2273	In a Libertarian society , SOCIETY is survival of the `` fittest '' meaning anyone who can not fend for his\/herself is not fit to live in society . 
10541	2273	The ONLY thing central government is required to do is protect our shores from foreign invasion !!! 
10542	2273	That 's THING !!!!!!!! 
10543	2273	Course OUR have to pay OUR soldiers to do that , which in point of fact , means SOLDIERS are mercenaries ! 
10544	2273	I agree with this statement except to point out that women of any color , religion , social\/economic status have been the victims of a dominate , power hungry , economic male society for millennia . 
10545	2273	Today , the U SA is well behind even emerging nations in this regard ... 
10546	2274	I suppose that if I wanted to help a person with college expenses or single mothers with income , or help support someone otherwise incapable of supporting MOTHERS , I would like the opportunity to pick and choose who and how I do it rather than send I money to Washington and have MOTHERS pick and choose . 
10547	2274	After MOTHERS have picked -LRB- stolen -RRB- the cream off the top . 
10548	2274	Without a government nanny , people have the ability to help others as OTHERS see fit and to spend OTHERS income as OTHERS see fit . 
10549	2274	I , for one , am positively sure that I can spend I money to better result than the saviors in DC . 
10550	2275	Just some comments about the `` efficiency '' of Medicare and Medicaid .1 . 
10551	2275	Those programs can only exist because they ` float ' on top of a strong , for profit ' health care system . 
10552	2275	Without that strong underlying system the under reimbursing Medicare\/Medicaid programs would collapse .2 . 
10553	2275	How is the `` efficiency '' achieved ? 
10554	2275	EFFICIENCY is achieved by contracting out to INSURANCE COMPANIES , the total day to day administration of Medicare\/Medicaid claims . 
10555	2275	Govt workers are NOT the ones doing the work . 
10557	2278	Every working person has a SS account and pays premiums into that account until retirement . 
10558	2278	ACCOUNT is labeled a `` trust '' fund , but ACCOUNT is n't . 
10559	2278	If Congress did not `` raid '' that `` trust '' in order to pay for items called `` discretionary , '' like Bratboy Bush 's Republican Congress passing `` supplemental '' bills to fund the 2 wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , SS and Medicare would be in the black for not just the baby boomers but BOOMERS grand children . 
10560	2278	Correct again , which clearly SHOWS THAT MEDICARE IS NOT GOVERNMENT RUN OR A GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER !!!!!!!!!!! 
10561	2278	The Administration of Medicare is a `` bid '' contract just like every other government contract ; EXCEPT for example in the case of a Bratboy Bush campaign donor or crony -LRB- aka Dick Cheney -RRB- like Halliburton and Blackwater . 
10562	2278	-LRB- Aside , off topic -RRB- Want to view some fact filled info that is sorely lacking on today 's media , CHEAPER recommend viewing , online , last night 's Frontline broadcast , `` Are CHEAPER Safer ; Flying Cheaper ; The Spy Who Quit . '' 
10563	2278	Just for the `` fraidy cat '' conservatives who are all too willing to sacrifice AGAIN `` rights '' for the old adage , `` CONSERVATIVES ca n't be too safe . '' 
10564	2278	Further note : CHEAPER totally disagree with the Afghan Intelligence Head who quit because EXCEPT wants Americans to stay in Afghanistan to win CONSERVATIVES war for CONSERVATIVES . 
10565	2278	If the Afghans want democracy , CONSERVATIVES will have to be willing to fight and sacrifice for AFGHANS CONSERVATIVES . 
10566	2278	AFGHANS is NOT the job of Americans to fight for democracy anywhere but here on our own soil . 
10567	2279	First ASPECT_SASSY_ say , and ME quote : `` The medicare program is one of the most efficient programs in history , even if one compares FIRST to `` private '' business . 
10568	2279	`` Then ME agree with ASPECT_SASSY_ that it is efficient BECAUSE FIRST is done by PRIVATE INSURANCE companies . 
10569	2279	And then ME go off on a Bush Cheney rant about spending . 
10570	2279	Do ME know the worst spending of the Bush era came after Jan 2007 ? 
10571	2279	AWFUL is a fact ! 
10572	2279	Jan 2007 is when the Democrats took TOTAL control of both the House and the Senate . 
10573	2279	With that spending included , the EIGHT YEARS under Bush saw our national debt increase by $ 5 TRILLION dollars . 
10574	2279	ME want to say that is AWFUL and ASPECT_SASSY_ will totally agree with ME . 
10575	2279	Now ASPECT_SASSY_ say that in just TWO YEARS under the obamalama OUR national debt has increased by $ 4 TRILLION dollars . 
10576	2279	ASPECT_SASSY_ 'm old and not up on ` the new math , ' so ME tell me which is worse . 
10577	2279	$ 5 TRILLION over EIGHT YEARS -LRB- $ 625 Billion per year average -RRB- , or $ 4 TRILLION over 2 years ? 
10578	2279	-LRB- $ 2 TRILLION per year average -RRB- But OUR are in agreement that politicians of both parties have raided the `` trust funds '' with regularity and impunity . 
10579	2280	2.7 billion dollars in welfare and Medical benefits in one year payable in LA County alone , where is ASPECT_DAN40_ state ? 
10580	2280	Ready to b ail us out ? 
10581	2280	Villaregrosa , told all illegal people VILLAREGROSA was a sanctuary city when VILLAREGROSA went against arizona , they all moved to California ! 
10582	2280	Jollee , California 
10583	2281	2.7 billion dollars in welfare and Medical benefits in one year payable in LA County alone , where is ASPECT_DAN40_ state ? 
10584	2281	Ready to bail us out ? 
10585	2281	Villaregrosa , told all illegal people VILLAREGROSA was a sanctuary city when VILLAREGROSA went against arizona , they all moved to California ! 
10586	2281	Jollee , California 
10587	2283	I did not stutter ... Jollee 
10588	2284	Not at all . 
10589	2284	Just because a private company gets the contract does n't make COMPANY `` more efficient . '' 
10590	2284	The government sets the guidelines for the product and the company who wins the contract . 
10591	2284	It is proved time and time again that `` waste '' in government contracts is propagated thru `` loopholes '' -LRB- which I showed in an earlier post how lack of oversight can cost millions -RRB- . 
10592	2284	Why is that ? 
10593	2284	Mostly because there are n't sufficient people in the bureaucracy to check every figure on the invoice , especially , if there 's a loophole not covered in the contract . 
10594	2284	There is fraud in Medicare because , e.g. a doctor commits fraud by using medicare accounts for procedures not done without the patient 's knowledge . 
10595	2284	The point I wanted to make about Bush\/Cheney is that the money used for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars was NEVER included in the Budget . 
10597	2284	The wars were -LRB- note I say , `` WERE '' -RRB- paid for by supplemental appropriations passed by Congress . 
10598	2284	Those bills are still being paid for in the national debt . 
10599	2284	I do n't have time to `` check '' ASPECT_DAN40_ figures and unless ASPECT_DAN40_ can give I an `` unbiased '' source for them , excuse I , if I doubt the figures ASPECT_DAN40_ quote are accurate or realistic . 
10600	2284	Yes , we do agree about the raid on the SS trust fund . 
10601	2284	RAID is shameful . 
10602	2284	Now ASPECT_DAN40_ neoconservatives want to repeal NOW , taking away from people the promise of dignity in old age PEOPLE have paid for in a lifetime of work . 
10603	2284	IOW , NEOCONSERVATIVES will NOT be getting what NEOCONSERVATIVES paid for . 
10604	2285	Read 'em and weep ! 
10605	2285	http:\/\/www.usdebtclock.org\/http:\/\/thenationaldebtcrisis.com\/the...-by-president\/http:\/\/www.treasurydirect.gov\/govt\/r...ebt_histo5.htmOr do ASPECT_SASSY_ wish to argue the treasury direct figures ? 
10606	2285	Not FOX , not the RNC , but the US treasury official figures . 
10607	2285	And remember the figures in the second link . 
10608	2285	Bush over $ 3 Trillion in FOX last 4 years -------------- the last 2 years of which were under a controlling majority of ALL of Congress by the Democratic Party . 
10609	2285	Or do ASPECT_SASSY_ wish to argue that too ? 
10610	2285	The simple net answers are : Bush WAS bad . 
10611	2285	$ 625 billion per year added to the debt ! 
10612	2285	BHO is much , much , much WORSE . 
10613	2285	$ 2 TRILLION PER YEAR ADDED TO THE DEBT The figures , in this case , do n't lie . 
10615	2286	And , if one good thing came out of the Carter Presidency , THING was followed by 12 years of Republican control . 
10616	2287	Reagan was one of our better ones in modern history . 
10617	2288	One way that could be helped is increase the amount of Legal immigrants allowed per year . 
10618	2288	WAY would decrease the lines to get in and would make WAY easier to come legally , possibly causing those who come illegally to consider doing WAY the right way ... 
10619	2289	If not the best ... 
10620	2290	That does not sound bad , however THAT doubt it would slow illegal immigration and all ASPECT_HIJOTHIS_ would do is add to the numbers . 
10621	2290	The fellow on the other side who is waiting , does not want to wait period . 
10622	2290	That just wont change . 
10623	2290	We have to stop giving these people so much and thus make CHANGE less attractive , CHANGE 's the only way . 
10624	2290	Why people do not understand entitlements encourage greed and illegals THAT just dont get . 
10625	2290	All ASPECT_HIJOTHIS_ are doing is saying . 
10627	2290	here take this . 's free , and the faster ASPECT_HIJOTHIS_ get here the faster ASPECT_HIJOTHIS_ will have THE . 
10628	2290	Oh and if ASPECT_HIJOTHIS_ leave a baby ASPECT_HIJOTHIS_ entire family will be welcome some day . 
10630	2290	We have raped WE Constitution and WE must straighten CONSTITUTION out , why is CONSTITUTION working for illegals and not WE ? 
10631	2290	Taking more in will just increase the total numbers , because no matter ASPECT_HIJOTHIS_ increase others will still be waiting . 
10632	2290	Not to mention WE will always get the criminals . 
10633	2291	Not really . 
10634	2291	Now ASPECT_DAN40_ switch the topic from `` spending '' to `` debt . '' 
10635	2291	BOLDING emphasis is on `` spending '' to complement `` ideology . 
10636	2291	`` Neoconservative Republicans ALWAYS talk about `` less government , lower taxes , -LRB- and since Reagan and the majority Republican Congress during Clinton -RRB- , about deregulation for big business and Wall Street . 
10637	2291	Nothing new here . 
10638	2291	Just about everyone shutters at the rising debt ! 
10639	2291	REPUBLICANS tried to find where this link is `` unbiased . '' 
10640	2291	There is no by-line as to who wrote this article . 
10641	2291	However , BOLDING quote the salient information as follows . 
10642	2291	`` Bolding '' is mine to highlight the disclaimer : BOLDING fail to see the significance of the link above . 
10643	2291	We can argue the debt increase and INCREASE will likely increase every year simply because the dollar continues to be devalued . 
10644	2291	The dollar value today is NOT the value VALUE was 50 years ago . 
10645	2291	`` Figures do n't lie , but liars can figure ! '' 
10646	2291	And , remember , Obama inherited the Bush spending debt , including TARP , 2 wars and the `` donut hole . '' 
10647	2291	`` ASPECT_DAN40_ say , ` Too May Toe , ' OBAMA say , ` To Ma Toe ' so , let 's call the whole thing off . '' 
10648	2291	NEOCON 're a neocon , BOLDING 'm an independent . 
10649	2291	ASPECT_DAN40_ will likely Never agree on ideology . 
10650	2291	BOLDING 'm a protect the `` people first '' person . 
10651	2291	A 're a protect the `` taxpayer first '' person . 
10652	2291	BOLDING believe the Constitution was written to protect the people in ALL aspects of national and international actionable relationships . 
10653	2291	BOLDING suspect ASPECT_DAN40_ believe the Constitution was written to protect ALL aspects of national and international economic relationships . 
10654	2291	BOLDING do n't mind paying taxes that protect and help people first . 
10655	2291	ASPECT_DAN40_ do n't like paying ANY tax that does n't benefit ASPECT_DAN40_ personally . 
10656	2291	In BOLDING view , the majority of the new Tea Party Congress WO N'T give up PEOPLE taxpayer funded health care to put PEOPLE `` benefits '' where PEOPLE mouth is . 
10657	2291	BOLDING call that hypocrisy . 
10658	2292	That is true . 
10660	2292	Tarp was passed prior to Obama coming in . 
10662	2292	and the first year is always due to the past admin . 
10665	2292	there was almost unanimous agreement by both sides that the markets had to be kept liquid . 
10666	2292	That spending was in the bag before Obama stepped in and SPENDING had to be done . 
10667	2292	Greenspan and cronies were to blame for creating the real estate bubble and not heeding warnings . 
10668	2292	Obama was handed the keys to a burning ship . 
10670	2292	and just before leaving gasoline was put on the fire . 
10671	2292	The fact that the ship is still floating is amazing . 
10673	2292	but neither the fire ... nor the fact that the ship is still floating has anything to do with Obama or the democrats . 
10675	2292	EFFORT was a completely bipartisan effort . 
10676	2292	Now that the hurricane seems to be over . 
10678	2292	it is time to see what Obama is going to do . 
10679	2292	What is really disheartening are the people that continue to do nothing but bash the other side . 
10681	2292	just because EFFORT is the other side . 
10682	2292	Having no evidence or substantiation for claims made . 
10683	2292	We need solutions . 
10685	2292	not finger pointing by fools -LRB- fool being defined as those that make unsubstantiated accusations -RRB- 
10686	2293	If ASPECT_SASSY_ care to go and find the statistics , the 2 wars are not that large a percentage of our spending . 
10687	2293	Military spending is a large part , but not the `` 2 wars . '' 
10688	2293	And ASPECT_SASSY_ are an out and out liberal , NOT an independent . 
10689	2293	If INDEPENDENT looks like a liberal , and INDEPENDENT talks like a liberal , and INDEPENDENT thinks like a liberal , and INDEPENDENT smells like a liberal , INDEPENDENT a liberal . 
10690	2293	And , remember , Obama inherited the Bush spending debt , including TARP , 2 wars and the `` donut hole . 
10691	2293	`` As OBAMA pointed out to ASPECT_SASSY_ earlier , the largest spending AND increase in ASPECT_SASSY_ debt in the Bush Presidency was after Jan 2007 when Democrats took TOTAL control of all of Congress . 
10692	2293	Spending and debt increase tripled Bush 's previous 6 year average under the Democrat control . 
10693	2293	And it was a Democrat Congress that passed TARP . 
10694	2293	Bush 's blame is in signing BLAME . 
10695	2293	Same as obamalama 's blame is in signing $ 4 trillion in debt increase by signing the Democrat 's bills . 
10696	2293	The national debt increased by $ 5 trillion dollars in 8 years under Bush . 
10697	2293	60 % of that increase occurred in years 1 through 6 with a Republican Congress . 
10698	2293	40 % of the increase occurred in years 7 and 8 under a Democratic Congress . 
10699	2293	As OBAMA constantly point out to ASPECT_SASSY_ die hard liberal convictions , Bush WAS bad . 
10700	2293	BHO is many TIMES Worse . 
10701	2293	ASPECT_SASSY_ projected an increase in the debt over $ 6 trillion in obamalama 's FIRST -LRB- and please , please , please , ONLY -RRB- term . 
10702	2293	A TRILLION MORE than Bush in HALF the time . 
10703	2293	WHAT more do ASPECT_SASSY_ need to know ? 
10704	2294	I agree . 
10705	2294	It would lessen the frustration of the legals , but ASPECT_FLOUNDER_ are right , IT would most likely no decrease the amounts of illegals . 
10706	2294	And the fact that we make IT so appetizing is 100 % correct . 
10707	2294	WE give LEGALS everything free and let LEGALS `` anchor '' babies . 
10708	2294	The Fair Tax nails WE though ... 
10709	2296	ME are to label me a `` liberal . '' 
10710	2296	CAPTAIN am NOT ! 
10711	2296	ASPECT_DAN40_ have n't any evidence of that other than CAPTAIN DISAGREE with ASPECT_DAN40_ !!!! 
10712	2296	Fact is , at one time in CAPTAIN youth , CAPTAIN was a Republican precinct captain , and most of the folk there tended to call FOLK a `` conservative . '' 
10713	2296	But when Reagan arrived on the scene , that was when CAPTAIN turned Independent and have been ever since . 
10714	2296	IMO , ASPECT_DAN40_ are the one that smells !!! 
10715	2296	with ASPECT_DAN40_ inability to provide sources for ASPECT_DAN40_ radical statements . 
10716	2296	ASPECT_DAN40_ are just like every other neoconservative , fiscally irresponsible when INABILITY comes to `` spending '' other people 's money and then whine and blubber -LRB- like NeoSpeaker Boehner -RRB- about the deficit and debt . 
10717	2296	And , remember , Obama inherited the Bush spending debt , including TARP , 2 wars and the `` donut hole . '' 
10718	2296	ASPECT_DAN40_ `` unbiased '' sources that actually quote these figures !!!!!! 
10719	2296	DEBT 's NOT CAPTAIN job to confirm ASPECT_DAN40_ figures . 
10720	2296	DEBT 's ASPECT_DAN40_ JOB to do that ! 
10721	2296	CAPTAIN am not ASPECT_DAN40_ to help ASPECT_DAN40_ prove ASPECT_DAN40_ argument . 
10722	2296	CAPTAIN did find this -LRB- please note CAPTAIN DO PROVIDE AN UNBIASED SOURCE -RRB- : 
10723	2297	Since ASPECT_SASSY_ wo n't accept the Us Dept of the Treasury as a source which ASPECT_SASSY_ have a link to examine their figures , go ahead and use ANY excuse ASPECT_SASSY_ wish to use . 
10724	2297	From the US TreasuryUS national debt at 3 months prior to obamalama 's inauguration :09 \/ 30\/2008 $ 10,024,724,896,912.49 US national debt today : $ 14,071,897,000,000 . 
10725	2297	Difference $ 4 TRILLION , 47 BILLION . 
10726	2297	Th wars were `` off Budget '' by Bush ? 
10727	2297	That 's ASPECT_SASSY_ argument . 
10728	2297	That is hilarious since EVERYTHING is `` off budget '' by the grossly incompetent , world wide laughing stock , clown , obamalama since CLOWN does NOT have a budget yet !!! 
10729	2298	ASPECT_SASSY_ further need to note that THEM national debt is stated in US dollars because DEBT is OUR national debt . 
10730	2298	DEBT is not in dollars vs. any other currency . 
10731	2298	WE owe China $ 1 Trillion United States Dollars , THEM do not owe them or anyone else the equivalent of a trillion dollars in THEM money . 
10732	2298	So the international value of the dollar does not effect THEM national debt . 
10733	2298	What can effect THEM national debt is THEM own INFLATION . 
10734	2298	And according to the Democrats in power since Jan 2007 until this month , there has been no inflation . 
10735	2298	Since 2008 , -LRB- Bush 's time -RRB- until now , according to THEM Govt . 
10736	2298	there has been no inflation , so that those receiving Govt paychecks with a COLA factor , have not received any increase since 2008 . 
10737	2298	So THEM national debt today is the same as if TODAY were stated in 2008 dollars . 
10738	2298	So go ahead and claim that the National debt clock site is biased , go ahead and claim that the US Treasury is biased , and go ahead and claim that SITE all inflation . 
10739	2298	Go ahead and keep ASPECT_SASSY_ eyes and mind firmly closed to the indisputable FACT that the gross clown obamalama has blown $ 4 TRILLION Dollars in 2 years and THEM have no robust economy , and no low unemployment , and no booming housing market to show for the absolute WASTE of $ 4 Trillion Dollars . 
10740	2298	OBAMALAMA blames the greed of Wall Street and the banks for THEM financial woes and then defends bailing out those same Wall Street firms and banks . 
10741	2298	OBAMALAMA blames Insurance companies for the unaffordability of health care and then champions a bill that VASTLY expands insurance companies markets ! 
10742	2298	Now OBAMALAMA is claiming to be more business friendly and hires the CEO of GE . 
10743	2298	The company that finances the obamalama propaganda and advertising networks of NBC and MSNBC . 
10744	2298	US 'd vote for a derelict living in a packing crate before US 'd vote for the idiot we have in DC now . 
10745	2299	CATS repeat : Figures do n't lie ! 
10746	2299	But , Liars can figure . 
10747	2299	Everything ASPECT_DAN40_ post shows ASPECT_DAN40_ contempt for ANY government , including those ASPECT_DAN40_ did and do vote for . 
10748	2299	Let CATS ask ASPECT_DAN40_ this : What or where would ASPECT_DAN40_ be without government ? 
10749	2299	Probably dead or suffering because the older ASPECT_DAN40_ are , the weaker ASPECT_DAN40_ are . 
10750	2299	Even extraordinary wealth or the amount of health care ASPECT_DAN40_ can purchase will not protect ASPECT_DAN40_ from physical disability , disease , poor care or public disinterest . 
10751	2299	CATS repeat : Conservatives are `` Fraidy Cats '' and ASPECT_DAN40_ are . 
10752	2299	ASPECT_DAN40_ are as terrified of those who do not pose a threat as ASPECT_DAN40_ are of those who do . 
10753	2299	ASPECT_DAN40_ think government is out to `` get CATS . '' 
10754	2299	In stead , ASPECT_DAN40_ place ASPECT_DAN40_ trust in free trade , the WTO , corporate greed and -- this is true irony -- in an amoral political party that propagates WTO self interest and survival over the moral imperative intrinsic in the Constitution : Equal protection under the law , human dignity and freedom from human misery . 
10755	2299	That 's exactly what CATS thought ASPECT_DAN40_ would do\/have done , and that `` idiot '' would still have more concern for ASPECT_DAN40_ well being than any neoconservative pundit , congressperson , evil-spirited Republican moron that spouts lies over facts , reveres dollars over human beings and global corporations over governments ! 
10756	2299	PS : ASPECT_DAN40_ still have n't provided a `` source '' for ASPECT_DAN40_ rhetoric . 
10757	2299	Anyone can twist figures from any source and make BEINGS `` work '' for an imprecise conclusion . 
10758	2299	There are more factors in the simplistic `` debt '' numbers ASPECT_DAN40_ use that `` mitigate '' the outcome ASPECT_DAN40_ insist upon -- as is clearly demonstrated in the source CATS quoted . 
10759	2299	But , people with closed minds to anything other than PEOPLE personal dogma are incapable of understanding that , even when POINT is an intrinsic point in the argument ! 
10760	2300	ASPECT_SASSY_ claim to be an independent not a liberal . 
10761	2300	Yet faced with indisputable facts ASPECT_SASSY_ fall back on the stereotypical liberal ploy of insulting the intelligence of ANY that disagree with ASPECT_SASSY_ closed minded opinions . 
10762	2300	The debt numbers are accurate , not put up by any left or right political propagandist . 
10763	2300	ASPECT_SASSY_ inability to see the truth is ASPECT_SASSY_ own burden to bear , not mine to share . 
10764	2300	I am against the Governments that we have had LATELY . 
10765	2300	WE went from bad to WORSE . 
10766	2300	In the past I 've put I life on the line for WE country , and WE Government , VOLUNTARILY ! 
10767	2300	And spent 60 days hospitalized after being air evacuated out to the Philippines . 
10768	2300	What have ASPECT_SASSY_ done for WE country ? 
10769	2300	I am a conservative independent and am tired of lying politicians of both sides . 
10770	2300	WE need someone who DOES understand what public service means and POLITICIANS WANT to actually SERVE the public . 
10771	2300	Instead of lining POLITICIANS pockets and currying favors for when POLITICIANS leave public life . 
10772	2301	Just wanted to highlight some idiocy in ASPECT_DAN40_ post ... I can assure idiocy and insults are not confined to being a liberal or conservative . 
10773	2301	I agree . 
10774	2301	I disagree . 
10775	2301	IDIOCY isnt worse , but IDIOCY isnt any better that 's for sure . 
10776	2301	Who cares , ASPECT_DAN40_ did IDIOCY voluntarily , got paid and now brag - what Henry V calls `` remembering with advantages '' . 
10777	2301	Whilst I detest conservatives more than liberals , as a libertarian I totally agree . 
10778	2301	Vote for Ron Paul ! 
10779	2301	A quality attributed to all sides of Washington . 
10780	2301	By the way , Liberalism IS NOT communism . 
10781	2301	In fact conservatives are simply another warped liberal group . 
10782	2302	I do n't know about ASPECT_GIFTEDONE_ but I 've already seen enough . 
10783	2302	Obama is a TOOL of corporate interests & Wall Street and a TOOL of the Washington warmongers . 
10784	2302	This is enough for I . 
10785	2302	However , in keeping with the topic of this thread , I read an interesting article on Huffington -LRB- which I try to avoid -RRB- titled : Barack Obama -- Out of the Closet and the article ended with a not too cryptic warning for Obama ; 
10786	2304	Thanx for posting ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ own version of wackiness . 
10787	2306	ASPECT_SASSY_ put the word mission in quote brackets so LIBERTARIAN will clear that up for ASPECT_SASSY_ ! 
10788	2306	LIBERTARIAN founded and own the missions and the church , but now they are owned by our members who now have a vested interest in participating in a religious community as well as a spiritual one ! 
10789	2306	Both missions -LRB- Mountain Manna Mission , ie MMM and Mission of the Crosses ie MOTA -RRB- are christian humanitarian missions with the bulk of OUR mission going to assist clients with basic needs . 
10790	2306	The church supports both with a 501c status which OUR use as a tax shelter etc. . 
10791	2306	The members of the church ie Apocalyptic Bearer Of The Cross Church , A.B.O.T.C.C. actually own stock in the church and missions . 
10792	2306	This is all public record in Carter County Court house in Carter County TN . 
10793	2306	Yes , a huge mega contradiction , kind of . 
10794	2306	HUGE s true LIBERTARIAN am a libertarian and lean conservative concerning most issues , but people are more complicated than labels that most people employ to ID or describe others . 
10795	2306	LIBERTARIAN am no this or that but a blend of this and that , as most of us are . 
10796	2306	LIBERTARIAN resist socialism in most cases . 
10797	2306	LIBERTARIAN don t want to see a black -LRB- white or green -RRB- third generation welfare mom ruining A life and the lives of MOM fourth generation welfare children . 
10798	2306	However due to mans inability to govern man , US have poverty , which produces citizens that are unable to earn enough money to pay for basic humanitarian needs . 
10799	2306	In those cases US should use government assistance . 
10800	2306	Read the above . 
10801	2306	With all due respect , trust LIBERTARIAN LIBERTARIAN was haunting the halls of the campus buildings \* long before ASPECT_SASSY_ were , LIBERTARIAN suspect . 
10802	2306	\* MA , comparative religion\/theology Yes , US have opened Pandora s Box and beheld a brave new world that sprang out and engulfed US in a big bang of modernism before US could close the -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- thing . 
10803	2306	The problem is that US species have not learned how to live in a society that does not need dominate , power hungry , economic males , so there is a square peg of those males trying to fit in the round hole of a modern world . 
10804	2306	In fact , if ASPECT_SASSY_ could imagine a vast landscape of trillions of different shaped pegs trying to fit in trillions of different shaped holes , ASPECT_SASSY_ would be imagining the modern world as LIBERTARIAN see LANDSCAPE . 
10805	2306	The pegs and holes are an analogy for the outdated and obsolete ideas and things in US world , trying to fit in reality of the modern world , represented analogically as the holes . 
10806	2306	Don t fret , most of those nasty males have been dying off and bequeathing MALES wealth to MALES surviving widows , giving MALES the power that MALES crave . 
10807	2306	As the baby boomers age and die , that process will accelerate for better or worse . 
10808	2306	Good for ASPECT_SASSY_ , LIBERTARIAN understand ASPECT_SASSY_ anger . 
10809	2306	Sorry ASPECT_SASSY_ had issues , LIBERTARIAN had some as well , which helps LIBERTARIAN understand . 
10810	2306	If ASPECT_SASSY_ are speaking about Obama s toxic health care bill\/tax , ANGER has too many problems . 
10811	2306	The first is the mandatory requirement . 
10812	2306	LIBERTARIAN am not opposed to a health care system subsidized by the government if done right . 
10813	2306	Obama s Health care folly is an example of how NOT to create a health care system . 
10814	2306	LIBERTARIAN don t really want to discuss Medicare etc. except to say MEDICARE could have been self sufficient , and that is the prime requirement , fiscal balance . 
10815	2306	First LIBERTARIAN am of the opinion that due to the very effective character assassination by the media , as well as by WOMAN own faults of not being PC LIBERTARIAN wouldn t want WOMAN to run for president until some time has passed say , eight years . 
10816	2306	If LIBERTARIAN were WOMAN handler , LIBERTARIAN would have WOMAN stop making blunders \* and comments that are non PC . 
10817	2306	Then LIBERTARIAN would groom WOMAN , for eight years , LIBERTARIAN guarantee at the end of that period WOMAN would sweep the election if conditions were as anti Democrats as YEARS is now . 
10818	2306	WOMAN is an highly intelligent woman -LRB- with an IQ that was estimated at 116 . 
10819	2306	Yes there was a fabricated fraud IQ test that indicated a score in the 80s and IQ has been making the internet rounds but IQ is fake and not validated -RRB- . 
10820	2306	WOMAN has impeccable moral and ethical standards , so LIBERTARIAN believe WOMAN would make a great president . 
10821	2306	\* -LRB- Blunders when viewed as someone running for president , SOMEONE has made no ethical or moral blunders LIBERTARIAN am aware of -RRB- That statement is simply twaddle . 
10822	2306	SOMEONE can be just as easily be indicted as a citizen as governor and we are still innocent until proven guilty , like MORAL or not . 
10823	2306	SOMEONE elected to quit the governorship to pursue a higher political office . 
10824	2306	Not to mention that SOMEONE was giving up a job that 99 % of WE would kill for ! 
10825	2306	So SOMEONE actually made a personal sacrifice by giving up SOMEONE desirable Governess position ! 
10826	2306	too long text 12,000 words to be cont . 
10827	2306	next post ~ 
10828	2307	Continued ~ Her multi million dollar estate . 
10829	2307	Yes , what a highly noble idea , ie to make money so ~ estate can care for the child , instead of becoming a burden on the state . 
10830	2307	ASPECT_SASSY_ see ms. Sassy many liberals would have aborted ~ challenged child for LIBERALS own convenience . 
10831	2307	Ah killing an unborn for purely selfish reasons is nothing to cherish and be admired for . 
10832	2307	No , those kinds of abortions are a natural crime called murder , and are beyond reprehensible . 
10833	2307	In contrast to a liberal pro death politico would do i.e. ; -LRB- abort for convenience -RRB- , what Palin did by keeping the child which I.E. knew would need a lifetime of care is so unselfish and beautiful , so morally and ethically correct , I would voted for I.E. nearly for that reason alone ! 
10834	2307	And POLITICO ramblings and \* cof \* opinions are ? 
10835	2307	Well wake up call ! 
10836	2307	ASPECT_SASSY_ are doing the very things ASPECT_SASSY_ claim that the members here are doing . 
10837	2307	Additionally , I would plead that ASPECT_SASSY_ avoid making any derogatory claims about who possess common sense and who doesn t ! 
10838	2307	Again ASPECT_SASSY_ may be accused of the same thing -LRB- lack of common sense -RRB- and CLAIM is too subjective a claim . 
10839	2307	For example ; Many may think that FEMINIST are a radical feminist holding a long festering grudge against white protestant males hoping to harm MANY by making hysterical and transparent claims where ASPECT_SASSY_ focus that long festering beam of ASPECT_SASSY_ rage in a blanket fashion ensnaring all those that claim any tidbit of libertarianism ? 
10840	2307	Hmm allow this libertarianism infected white Christian male to extend an even more repulsive -LRB- to many extremely extreme liberals -RRB- a bit of scriptural advice ? 
10841	2307	; Matthew 7:5 Hypocrite , first take the beam out of ASPECT_SASSY_ own eye That is not just religious FIRST practical information as well , PEOPLE all would be better people if we studied and placed FIRST in practice . 
10842	2307	Yes most of those sources have something to sell are not accurate and many are fraudulent . 
10843	2307	I love the net but the material at the library are much better referenced validated and complete . 
10844	2307	I do agree that the Godless secular school system has failed WE , and SYSTEM time to take WE schools back from the liberal secular progressives . 
10845	2307	PROGRESSIVES have nearly destroyed WE school system and harmed untold millions of students by spewing PROGRESSIVES doctrine . 
10846	2307	But that 's material for another thread . 
10847	2307	Even WE disagree nearly entirely I am happy to meet ASPECT_SASSY_ and look forward to more productive debate ~ ~ rr ~ 
10848	2308	Good for ASPECT_JIYUU-FREEDOM_ JF . 
10849	2308	OBAMA have not always been so anti Obama . 
10850	2308	True , OBAMA have never been a cheerleader for him . 
10851	2308	Nevertheless , by the time HIM had won OBAMA had a quasi optimistic attitude that maybe HIM would be good for the country , despite some very large concerns over whom HIM may appoint for the SCOTUS , and other very important issues such as HIM record on late term abortion and abortion in general . 
10852	2308	Too bad HIM not only did not measure up HIM polices have brought the USA to the brink of collapse , in OBAMA opinion . 
10853	2308	~ rr ~ 
10854	2309	EXCERPETED ; Care to expand on that statement MD ? 
10855	2309	I am speaking of the last sentence .

10857	2310	Had ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ said that liberalism is not supposed to be like communism , I would agree with ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ . 
10858	2310	But liberalism today has been prostituted into communism . 
10859	2310	` Splain to I , in ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ unlimited wisdom , the difference in these 2 philosophies.Com munism : From each according to his ability , to each according to EACH need ! 
10860	2310	Liberalism : Redistribute the wealth . 
10861	2310	Both are saying , TAKE from those who have earned WEALTH , and GIVE WEALTH to those who have n't earned WEALTH . 
10862	2311	The difference is huge.Com munism takes \* everything \* primarily for the benefit of the state which redistributes equally . 
10863	2311	Liberals say that the quid pro quo of the benefits of capitalism is that ASPECT_DAN40_ share \* some \* of the fabulous wealth ASPECT_DAN40_ are allowed to generate and accumulate to provide safety nets for those who for do n't have the market value for basic needs . 
10864	2311	QUO 's always surprising to me how many conservatives do n't understand basic economic concepts . 
10865	2312	I would and have said that all governments are evil by default , and by the degrees of evil . 
10866	2312	The reason I say that is because to be a government the government must govern i.e. control REASON citizens . 
10867	2312	I would go on but I basset hound , bogie is trying to snif out a place to pee and I.E. has found I ankles ... ~ rr ~ 
10869	2314	I 've never said that . 
10870	2314	Ca n't rebut a strawman . 
10871	2314	Cite to liberals who say that as an example please . 
10872	2316	Good for ASPECT_JASON_SHURNAS_ Mr Jason . 
10873	2316	Obama is not presidential material . 
10874	2316	~ rr ~ 
10875	2319	Is that figure based on the Bush tax cuts being permanently continued or being repealed ? 
10876	2321	If that is what impresses ASPECT_(R)IGHTEOUS_1_ as awesome , ASPECT_(R)IGHTEOUS_1_ might want to consider forums like Freerepublic.com or rightnation.com . 
10877	2321	Those forums are even more awesomely decidely AGAINST Obama than this one is . 
10878	2322	Meh , I like this one , ONE worldly . 
10879	2322	Plus we outnumber the Obamabots here by more than 2 fold . 
10880	2322	More than good enough for I . 
10881	2323	ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ want to give us some reasons ? 
10882	2323	ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ always seem to have such strong opinions on things , but ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ never give US any reasons . 
10883	2324	Suit ASPECT_(R)IGHTEOUS_1_ self . 
10884	2324	ASPECT_(R)IGHTEOUS_1_ seemed more awesomely impressed with a forum by how against Obama FORUM is . 
10885	2325	501c -LRB- 3 -RRB- IMO , `` religious '' organizations that promote the `` public '' welfare actually do n't . 
10886	2325	ORGANIZATIONS have a `` mission . '' 
10887	2325	ORGANIZATIONS `` mission '' is to directly or indirectly , intentionally influence the receiver . 
10888	2325	Some overtly prostelytize using the term , `` mission '' e.g. to show E.G. intent to convert to a religious ideology . 
10889	2325	The government in allowing this tax exemption is promoting , underwriting and taking from profitable taxpayers and redistributing EXEMPTION to those who are unprofitable . 
10890	2325	That 's a socialistic concept that seems a complete contradiction to the Libertarian philosophy as defined in Wikipedia : Which simply says , ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ studied `` religion '' not philosophy . 
10891	2325	There is a world of difference such as , e.g. Physics uses Mathematics , but DISCIPLINE is a scholastic discipline a world apart in function . 
10892	2325	Philosophy is the study of human activity through reason . 
10893	2325	Religion is the study of human activity through `` faith , '' in spite of reason . 
10894	2325	RELIGION is interesting to note that most pre and baby boom American `` males '' -LRB- of any color -RRB- bridle when exposed to the universal `` truth '' that women have been abused by males in all , and probably before , recorded history . 
10895	2325	When birth control for women became affordable and available , modern women are now the `` chooser '' of the male that will father `` her '' child . 
10896	2325	Thus , society has reverted to the pre-religious concept of the dominate gender which was female , as CONCEPT is with most of natural selection . 
10897	2325	While FAN am not a fan of the '' -LRB- Three -RRB- witches of Endor : '' Sarah Palin , Sharron Angle , Michelle Bachman -LRB- sp -RRB- FAN think women leaders , on average , are better suited to govern with compassion , good sense and good will than men ; who are , on average , too quick to retaliate with force than with reason . 
10898	2325	JFK was a notable exception when ENDOR decided , opposing ALL ENDOR military advisors , to NOT invade Cuba ! 
10899	2325	Probably because ENDOR experienced first hand the futility of war . 
10900	2325	Not so with GWB , who along with Dick Cheney -LRB- aka Darth Vader -RRB- managed to evade the draft for Viet Nam . 
10901	2325	Neither were exposed to the horrors of war but eager to send others to OTHERS death to secure the oil fields of Iraq . 
10902	2325	Neoconservatives are , above all else , obsessed with securing wealth over human misery . 
10903	2325	FAN recovered quickly from FAN sense of `` injustice , '' not anger per se , and wrote a recommendation for FAN competitor , whom FAN knew and liked . 
10904	2325	Today , THERAPIST is a licensed therapist . 
10905	2325	FAN sense of injustice goes to the social hypocrisy that FAN had a man to pay FAN tuition when THERAPIST did not . 
10906	2325	In an ideal world . 
10907	2325	But , life is not a mathematic or ethical equation and never will be . 
10908	2325	So , why throw the baby out with the bath water ? 
10909	2325	WATER would seem from the polls and the pundits that no one was satisfied with the bill that passed . 
10910	2325	BUT , if ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ agree that the government CAN handle national health care -- which BUT has done successfully in Medicare and Veterans Health Care for decades -- then why not a public option that puts a net over the insurance industry to `` play fair ? '' 
10911	2325	Plus , if Income Tax and SS is mandatory , why is health care not Constitutional ? 
10912	2325	Especially , if TAX is designed for the public good ? 
10913	2325	TAX collects from all who receive `` income , '' not just for those who can afford out-of-control premiums . 
10914	2325	ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ may be sincere here , but ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ `` insight '' into this woman and JOAN ambitions is flawed and without a strong foundation . 
10915	2325	JOAN is n't Joan of Arc or Mother Theresa . 
10916	2325	JOAN 's an opportunistic fraud . 
10917	2325	Every action JOAN 's taken is a prime example of self centered wealth based ambition . 
10918	2325	Some people can be self-educated , but JOAN does n't even read the newspapers . 
10919	2325	JOAN has some skill with a `` quip '' but Tina Fey 's characterization of Palin as a beauty pageant candidate is spot on . 
10920	2325	If JOAN were blonde , JOAN 'd be called a `` dumb blonde . 
10921	2325	`` Go to page 2 for response to the rest of ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ post . 
10922	2326	I know , it 's great 
10923	2327	This is a conclusion solely based on ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ Christian ideology . 
10924	2327	Yes , Palin , at this point in time can well afford to care for her disabled child . 
10925	2327	But , CHILD is n't `` relying on the Lord '' to provide care as most of those of the Christian faith expect a woman to do . 
10926	2327	Anti-abortion advocates will encourage and even aid CHILD to CHILD decision to birth the baby , but CHILD 's on CHILD own after that . 
10927	2327	Hardly the `` Christian '' thing to do . 
10928	2327	Nor are ADVOCATES willing to `` adopt '' that child to raise THING , educate THING until it is able to survive on THING own . 
10929	2327	No , NO let `` government '' do that . 
10931	2327	Is n't this a case of the pot calling the kettle black ? 
10932	2327	May SOME suggest ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ honor ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ own judgment applied to SOME . 
10933	2327	SOME agree , `` some '' libraries are better than others . 
10934	2327	That 's true of the sources on the internet as well . 
10935	2327	But , anyone who can use a computer can save time by using COMPUTER and the internet to research and learn . 
10936	2327	COMPUTER is a tool . 
10937	2327	COMPUTER can be a weapon . 
10938	2327	Like most man made tools , COMPUTER best used with caution , reason and intelligence . 
10939	2328	Care to expand on that statement MD ? 
10940	2328	I am speaking of the last sentence . 
10941	2328	~ rr ~ Perhaps ~ will answer from his\/her understanding , but I 've heard this before where Neoconservatism can be summed up pretty much as follows : Borrow and spend because deficits do n't matter ! 
10942	2329	Once again for ASPECT_SASSY_ total enjoyment `` From the first day of George Washington 's Presidency through the last day of Bill Clinton 's Presidency , ASPECT_SASSY_ racked up a total of $ 5 TRILLION Dollars of national debt . 
10943	2329	THAT was too much spending ! 
10944	2329	Then George Bush took over , and increased the national debt from the $ 5 TRILLION left by Clinton , to $ 10 TRILLION at the end of Bush 's 8 years . 
10945	2329	Bush , in only 8 years , equaled the total OVERspending by all Presidents before BUSH . 
10946	2329	That is terrible . 
10947	2329	Then the obamalama comes in in Jan 2009 with a national debt of $ 10 TRILLION . 
10948	2329	Now NOW Jan 2011 , TWO YEARS LATER , and the national debt stands at $ 14 TRILLION . 
10949	2329	In only 2 years 2 has equaled 80 % of the awful amount Bush spent , and also equaled 80 % of all Presidents combined from Clinton back to Washington . 
10950	2329	The Congressional Budget Office -LRB- CBO -RRB- projects our national debt will be $ 18 TRILLION at the end of 2015 . 
10951	2329	Not FOX , not Republicans , but the CBO . 
10952	2329	And the CBO is projecting their number because of `` proposed '' spending reductions . 
10953	2329	The mathematical projection at today 's rate of spending is $ 22 TRILLION of national debt by the end of 2015 . 
10954	2329	$ 22,000,000,000,000.002015 And what did the obamalama choose to talk about the most in OBAMALAMA State of the Union campaign speech ? 
10955	2329	` Investments ! ' 
10956	2329	That means MORE Govt spending , when we have only a little less than $ 00.60 cents for every dollar WE are spending . 
10957	2329	Meaning , every dollar WE spend , WE have to borrow a bit over $ 00.40 cents . 
10958	2329	How hard could MEANING be to find ANYONE that can do better than this incompetent clown ? 
10959	2330	ME am happy ASPECT_DAN40_ spread the blame where BLAME belongs , this is not a partisan issue , BLAME an survival issue ! 
10960	2330	That said , is n't the debt terrifying ? 
10961	2330	ME mean DEBT absoultely horrifying ! 
10962	2330	Some or maybe many of ME virtual and regular friends think ME am a bit eccentric as ME build ME new home\/office to double as a ` bug out ' shelter \* of sorts . 
10963	2330	The building -LRB- Church and mission offices -RRB- and despite is fully off the grid capable , self sufficient in electrical power , including heating and cooling and can support two adults for over a year without restocking . 
10964	2330	ME am not a nut but rather simply endowed with the inability to stick ME head in the sand , and perhaps more important ME am blessed with a normal dose of common sense . 
10965	2330	NUT 's obvious me that we can not sustain anywhere near the level of spending that WE seem to think is normal ! 
10966	2330	ME would urge everyone get prepared with a survival plan and options should the worst happen . 
10967	2330	God bless all of ASPECT_DAN40_ . 
10968	2330	~ rr ~ 
10969	2331	ASPECT_(R)IGHTEOUS_1_ are welcome here ! 
10970	2331	Great minds think alike ! 
10971	2331	~ rr ~ 
10972	2332	Yes I agree . 
10973	2332	BTW I will reply to ASPECT_SASSY_ rebuttal ASAP . 
10974	2332	I need a coupld hours to nod ~ rr ~ 
10975	2333	Hi Sassy , LIBERTARIAN did n't have time to edit this thing for grammar so LIBERTARIAN hope THING Legible ! 
10976	2333	LIBERTARIAN am so very aware of that falsehood and FALSEHOOD simply paranoia often and , with all due respect FALSEHOOD &#8217; s a rank falsehood . 
10977	2333	LIBERTARIAN have heard FALSEHOOD so often LIBERTARIAN know where ASPECT_SASSY_ are going with this . 
10978	2333	Even if the recipients of theistic giving receives a huge dose of religion with the goodies , RECIPIENTS still definitely are getting assistance etc ! 
10979	2333	ASPECT_SASSY_ logic is so fallible in that statement that LIBERTARIAN nearly didn &#8217; t read the rest of ASPECT_SASSY_ reply , except to give T a cursory glance and dumbed down reply . 
10980	2333	However LIBERTARIAN took a chance that ASPECT_SASSY_ were not being totally malicious and decided to give ASPECT_SASSY_ reply the benefit of the doubt and LIBERTARIAN am happy LIBERTARIAN did , because ASPECT_SASSY_ made some good points . 
10981	2333	Well most school children know that Christian missionaries are umm &#8217; &#8230; . 
10982	2333	Christian missionaries ! 
10983	2333	&#8230; &#8217; s not like S are going to get ambushed , or given small pox infected blankets along with a what would Jesus do \/ love ASPECT_SASSY_ fellow man tract ! 
10984	2333	That is such a repetitively harped message &#8230; would be comical Sassy ! 
10985	2333	If LIBERTARIAN offer assistance by LIBERTARIAN missions yes LIBERTARIAN may exposed to some awful things including but not limited seeing a bible on LIBERTARIAN desk or a bit of scripture on the walls . 
10986	2333	ASPECT_SASSY_ may even be asked to come to church , however ASPECT_SASSY_ wont be bushwhacked from out of the blue ! 
10987	2333	Anyone that comes to a church knows that they just might be exposed to Jesus stuff ! 
10988	2333	The good news is -LRB- in addition to scripture -RRB- that secular organizations will charge cash for ORGANIZATIONS services or food etc. . 
10989	2333	If ASPECT_SASSY_ have no cash ASPECT_SASSY_ will starve or be denied the services . 
10990	2333	However , our clients will not be turned away unless CLIENTS are a danger to CLIENTS or OUR staff . 
10991	2333	-LRB- when LIBERTARIAN was up and running -RRB- . 
10992	2333	Yes indeedy ! 
10993	2333	Giving stuff away is unprofitable ! 
10994	2333	And ASPECT_SASSY_ are failing again in ASPECT_SASSY_ logic . 
10995	2333	All taxpayers pay taxes , not just profitable taxpayers , ha ha . 
10997	2333	However LIBERTARIAN will say that some missions could be seen an endeavor in socialism . 
10998	2333	That &#8217; s a given eh ? 
10999	2333	In fact Jesus would be a communist if JESUS were alive today . 
11000	2333	However LIBERTARIAN already replied to ASPECT_SASSY_ concerns . 
11001	2333	LIBERTARIAN said that LIBERTARIAN am not an libertarian in every respect , LIBERTARIAN went to pains to point that out . 
11002	2333	LIBERTARIAN believe that because of a perversion of society which was accomplished by embracing an paradigm of progressive liberalism and by accepting logical positivism -LRB- over metaphysics -RRB- we are forced to adopt some tenets of socialism . 
11003	2333	The early church was a form of socialism . 
11004	2333	LIBERTARIAN have never said all socialism is bad have LIBERTARIAN ? 
11005	2333	There is no black and white in anything in this temporal universe , -LRB- ie WE tangible universe -RRB- . 
11006	2333	Trust LIBERTARIAN , everything resides in shades of black and white , nothing is provable to an accuracy of 100 % . 
11007	2333	-LRB- that is not a straw man claim but CLAIM &#8217; s close due to Godel universes and the beautifully strange way the quantum world behaves due to uncertainty and non-locality etc. -RRB- ASPECT_SASSY_ must know that if ASPECT_SASSY_ earn a MA in theology ASPECT_SASSY_ have more semester hours in philosophy than in nearly any other field . 
11008	2333	LIBERTARIAN have and LIBERTARIAN do . 
11009	2333	ASPECT_SASSY_ should not make such claims in a public forum sassy . 
11010	2333	Again not all things are black and white . 
11011	2333	Personally LIBERTARIAN think ASPECT_SASSY_ may should allow ASPECT_SASSY_ to accept anything given freely without guilt and or anger . 
11012	2333	We agree again . 
11013	2333	If WE could know 100 % of the variables in the precise moment of calculation WE could know everything about anything , and not even God can or chooses to know that about this universe . 
11014	2333	And without going off topic MOMENT that very concept that God chooses not to know or more likely can not know to an accuracy of 100 % all the variables that constitutes the universe that gives WE free will . 
11015	2333	ASPECT_SASSY_ bring up some good points . 
11016	2333	Personally , LIBERTARIAN believe the IRS and many taxes , including the income tax are illegal ! 
11017	2333	Adding another wrong to the bath water ie Obamas health care baby doll only reinforces bad behavior . 
11018	2333	So LIBERTARIAN say that yes , we should throw the dead baby doll out with the bath water ! 
11019	2333	Lastly LIBERTARIAN should say that having to pay taxes etc isn &#8217; t the same as being forced to buy a PRODUCT . 
11020	2333	Other reasons come to mind not the least being that the health care thing may not stand up to constitutional muster ! 
11021	2333	Well ASPECT_SASSY_ must understand that when LIBERTARIAN read her Bio LIBERTARIAN saw a woman more accomplished that most . 
11022	2333	HER is much more accomplished than most of those that criticizes -LRB- LIBERTARIAN should say crucifies HER -RRB- . 
11023	2333	Additionally , LIBERTARIAN highly admire HER moral values ie HER Christianity etc. . 
11024	2333	Of course many people would write HER off precisely because HER is a Christian and is pro life . 
11025	2333	Most pro choice do not really understand or believe pro life people and that is a shame , but that in and of OF is another thread -LRB- abortion , morals etc -RRB- ra 
11026	2334	ASPECT_SASSY_ certainly have some queer ideas about Christians Sassy ! 
11027	2334	Most Christians consider the lord grants our station in life . 
11028	2334	Some do n't thinking that God will provide only after death but that 's not what scripture tells OUR . 
11029	2334	ASPECT_SASSY_ think that maybe ASPECT_SASSY_ ought to brush up on the Christian faith if ASPECT_SASSY_ plan to debate subjects that deal with theology , particularly Christianity . 
11030	2334	Again , ASPECT_SASSY_ are very wrong about that as well . 
11031	2334	There are more Christian support groups than secular groups , additionally the church would support her at least GROUPS would in most cases . 
11032	2334	ASPECT_SASSY_ church is not a true church , as ASPECT_SASSY_ do not preach except as in a guest capacity . 
11033	2334	However , the church of ASPECT_SASSY_ youth has provided for many members that fell upon hard times , as the ` biker ' church that ASPECT_SASSY_ regularly attend . 
11034	2334	Ummm ' ASPECT_SASSY_ goggled for Christian free services for mentally handicapped disabled children and received so many hits that ASPECT_SASSY_ could not fit CHILDREN on this page . 
11035	2334	Therefore , ASPECT_SASSY_ tried pasting CHILDREN to a word processor document and received an error message saying the listings exceeded the capability of the WP ! 
11036	2334	ASPECT_SASSY_ guess that rather shoots ASPECT_SASSY_ claims down . 
11037	2334	Next ASPECT_SASSY_ Goggled atheist organizations that offered free services for children etc etc. . 
11038	2334	ASPECT_SASSY_ could fit all of them on ... ummm ... on ... ahhh ' a matchbook cover ! 
11039	2334	ASPECT_SASSY_ are assuming that the mother does not take the child ! 
11040	2334	Ha ha in fact ASPECT_SASSY_ are so off base that ASPECT_SASSY_ am beginning to wonder what ASPECT_SASSY_ agenda is . 
11041	2334	The sad fact of the matter is that ASPECT_SASSY_ think ASPECT_SASSY_ really think those claims are true . 
11042	2334	ASPECT_SASSY_ am astonished that so much disinformation\/propaganda exists . 
11043	2334	Apparently , successful propaganda has convinced normally intelligent people like ASPECT_SASSY_ that lies are truth . 
11044	2334	ASPECT_SASSY_ do . 
11045	2334	Where have ASPECT_SASSY_ been the first to come out of the blue and wrongly accuse ASPECT_SASSY_ of anything ? 
11046	2334	Well yes ASPECT_SASSY_ are correct , ASPECT_SASSY_ use the computer too much simply take ASPECT_SASSY_ chances . 
11047	2334	So , we can agree on some items , which is a good indicator that WE can discuss the issues without the argument or discussion becoming toxic . 
11048	2334	The biggest criticism ASPECT_SASSY_ have of ASPECT_SASSY_ replies is that ASPECT_SASSY_ made quite a few non-sourced and unsubstantiated claims , many which were reworded are old atheist standbys or worse , however even the worst ones have n't damaged ASPECT_SASSY_ credibility . 
11049	2334	ASPECT_SASSY_ know that ASPECT_SASSY_ have criticisms for ASPECT_SASSY_ as well ! 
11051	2335	Right now the interest on our debt is at historically and ridiculously low levels . 
11052	2335	Lucky for OUR . 
11053	2335	Some EU countries that have gone beyond OUR own terrible debt levels are now paying OVER 11 % on their debt . 
11054	2335	While 5 % t0 8 % would be a more normal interest rate for OUR to be paying , that is not the present case . 
11055	2335	But imagine if OUR were paying 7 % on OUR debt . 
11056	2335	NOT an unusually high rate .7 % X $ 14 TRILLION = $ 980,000,000,000.00 . 
11057	2335	$ 980 billion dollars INTEREST . 
11058	2335	More than the Medicare\/Medicaid total . 
11059	2335	More than the Social Security total . 
11060	2335	More than the Defense Dept. total . 
11061	2335	Even at our very low rate of interest , the interest amount is the single largest expense OUR have NOW ! 
11062	2335	While M\/M or SS or DD are higher totals , they are covering multiple agencies\/depts . 
11063	2335	and multiple programs . 
11064	2335	Interest is a single line , and already the highest single line . 
11065	2336	Well ASPECT_FLOUNDER_ will read a more detailed report , but basically REPORT eliminates the avoidable taxes -LRB- well none should be avoidable , but ... -RRB- The one tax they ca n't avoid is the Sales tax because THEY have to buy things . 
11066	2336	I mean Wal-Mart would be one of the best examples of where THEY would HAVE to pay taxes . 
11067	2336	The sales tax would be possibly shockingly high , around 30 % if I 'm not mistaken -LRB- gotta check that -RRB- and TAX would , in theory make up for the other lost taxes . 
11068	2336	Ca n't avoid a sales tax or else ASPECT_FLOUNDER_ have no food , clothes , technology , cosmetics , etc. ... 
11069	2337	If one pays taxes , one is deemed `` profitable , '' because they have income over expenses . 
11070	2337	`` Non-profit '' means exactly that , `` no income over expenses . '' 
11071	2337	If ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ do , ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ pay tax or get a `` tax credit '' that `` forgives '' the overage up to a certain amount . 
11072	2337	I do n't disagree with ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ posit . 
11073	2337	NO idea is concrete . 
11074	2337	And , that 's the very foundation of philosophy . 
11075	2337	What seems to be , just may not be . 
11076	2337	That 's also the foundation of scientific theory and why a theory must be replicated over and over before it is justified to be used as a matter of fact . 
11077	2337	Except that `` religion '' is the basis for the study . 
11078	2337	Why not ? 
11079	2337	Not necessarily `` more capable '' just `` more aware '' of how hard JUST is to grow and bear a child and then lose the life of that child to something that is avoidable . 
11080	2337	Children are the first priority for most women . 
11081	2337	I do n't think a majority of men think that way , tho ' I 'm also sure some do . 
11082	2337	I do not presume to know what god thinks , chooses to know or not know . 
11083	2337	I do take for I personal philosophy the teachings found in the NT . 
11084	2337	I believe the inhumanity of humanity toward humanity is barbaric , founded in a perverted , distorted prime imperative `` to survive . '' 
11085	2337	Human beings have the intellectual ability to `` see '' beyond selfish , egocentric instincts and can reason together to a achieve a `` win-win '' goal for the public good . 
11086	2340	True that . 
11087	2340	Consumers tax . 
11088	2340	No taxes on anything else except consumer goods . 
11089	2340	Have ASPECT_HIJOTHIS_ found any links to support the 30 % figure . 
11090	2340	I 'd be interested in reading that . 
11091	2341	Imagine that all those programs that ASPECT_ONETHUNDER_ pay taxes to support were to become voluntary . 
11092	2341	In other words , instead of sending money to the mongrels through threat of prosecution , ASPECT_ONETHUNDER_ decide what programs that ASPECT_ONETHUNDER_ want to support and how much money that ASPECT_ONETHUNDER_ want to send to support MONGRELS . 
11093	2341	The idea being that ASPECT_ONETHUNDER_ are more careful spending ASPECT_ONETHUNDER_ money than politicians are . 
11094	2341	The result would be next to no spending by the fed gov outside of defense and a real infusion of ASPECT_ONETHUNDER_ cash locally . 
11095	2341	This is a very simplified version of what Ron Paul has been saying for thirty years . 
11096	2341	To learn a very detailed version , go to PAUL website -LRB- there are many -RRB- . 
11097	2341	Fair tax , consumer tax , etc. are all just different names for the same thing . 
11098	2341	The pols will not turn loose of the money if ASPECT_ONETHUNDER_ do n't make POLS . 
11099	2341	Check LOOSE out . 
11100	2341	ASPECT_ONETHUNDER_ having control of all ASPECT_ONETHUNDER_ income - what a novel idea . 
11102	2341	I would like to try CRAZY and see . 
11103	2343	Have n't had too much time . 
11104	2343	Will try by tomorrow . 
11105	2344	No way ! 
11106	2344	still after two years and being an active Democrat , I will not vote for DEMOCRAT ! 
11108	2346	Interesting figures . 
11109	2346	Scary figures . 
11110	2346	What would happen if WE -LRB- the USA -RRB- said ` no we will not pay WE debt off ? ' 
11111	2346	And that ` and any attempt to collect payment will result in war ! 
11113	2347	ASPECT_JOLLEE_ were -LRB- are -RRB- a democrat ? 
11114	2347	Ha ha that 's ok Jollee , ASPECT_JOLLEE_ vote the issues -LRB- and not the party line -RRB- as well . 
11116	2349	I sincerely hope that Palin does not run . 
11117	2349	She does best staying on the sidelines and annoying the libs . 
11118	2350	Such a move would require that we immediately cut Federal and State spending by a few TRILLIONS of dollars since WE would no longer be able to borrow any money at any rate . 
11119	2350	Might be worth a try !!! 
11120	2350	Also would result in recall or impeachment movements since the bulk of WE debt is owed to US citizens . 
11121	2352	How about a billy club ??? 
11122	2353	Not even a `` Billy '' beer . 
11123	2354	The first thing that would go unfunded would be the Department of Defense ! 
11124	2355	Not that many are so stupid to think the world is filled with nice people . 
11125	2355	A 30 minute study of world history would tell ASPECT_JOEY_SAC_ that the DoD is one of the most vital departments we have . 
11126	2355	Many cuts might need to be made , but the DoD is essential to WE survival as a country and just as people . 
11127	2356	http:\/\/www.fairtax.org\/site\/News2?ne...rticle&amp;id=8248Turns out RATE 's less than I thought : RATE would be a 23 % tax rate , not a 30 % rate . 
11128	2356	Even better ! 
11129	2357	I 'm exploring that website now . 
11130	2357	Enlightening reading so far . 
11131	2358	I have a shirt SIMILAR to that of ASPECT_ONETHUNDER_ photo I.D. Mine says something about border control and is relevant to ASPECT_ONETHUNDER_ 
11132	2360	SHOULD not be is the key word . 
11133	2360	Will he NOT be ? 
11134	2360	That 's hard to discern at this point . 
11135	2361	True , we must maintain the DoD to defend WE . 
11136	2361	But what would be the difference in costs of defending the USA versus the American Empire . 
11137	2361	The costs would be in international corporate profits ie haliburton ! 
11139	2363	I certainly hope that the American public will not be that incredibly stupid again . 
11140	2363	And the Republican candidate ? 
11141	2363	This far in advance of the 2008 elections , the obamalama was NOT a Democratic possibility . 
11142	2363	There is still time for a candidate , not yet considered a possibility , to emerge . 
11143	2363	BHO did . 
11144	2363	And imagine the difference if the obamalama has to run against an actual STRONG candidate , that is neither old nor carrying Bush baggage . 
11145	2363	Whomever was the Democratic Candidate in 2008 was a walkover . 
11146	2363	BHO had to beat a woman , that 's all . 
11147	2363	All the other Democrats shot themselves in the foot . 
11148	2363	And McCain was a sacrificial lamb . 
11149	2363	Now the obamalama will have to overcome OBAMALAMA OWN failed policies and the most incredible debt ever run up by any president ever . 
11150	2363	OBAMALAMA is the one that will be dragging the baggage this coming election . 
11151	2363	And 2 years from now , OBAMALAMA bullcrap of the last 2 years will be even more revealed than YEARS is now . 
11152	2364	I find it funny how libs bash the Tea Party movement . 
11154	2364	They stand for Constitutional government , and are against big , wasteful government . 
11155	2364	THEY are a Conservative movement . 
11156	2364	Everyone should be behind THEY . 
11157	2365	Some of us are against deficits and like the fact US do n't have hordes of the aged , infirm and temporarily out of luck living under freeways begging at stoplights . 
11158	2366	DEM consider ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ one of the most informed people on the right so DEM will not insult ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ intelligence . 
11159	2366	The Tea Party has a good idea about getting government spending under control , -LRB- ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ know DEM am a Dem -RRB- . 
11160	2366	But , like many DEM can not join any organization that has racist overtones . 
11161	2366	DEM do not believe all Tea Partiers are racist , but the accusation continues to be made , and the Tea Party has not rejected PARTY with vigor . 
11162	2366	All ACCUSATION takes is one picture like this , and the Tea Party credibility is gone for a lot of people . 
11163	2366	So , for those like DEM the Tea Party is a write-off . 
11164	2367	President Obama was elected by a maj. . 
11166	2367	major ... majori . 
11167	2367	. had the most votes ! 
11168	2367	When ASPECT_DAN40_ wish upon a star ... ... Dream on . 
11169	2370	Many things can kill a political party . 
11170	2370	And yes , the Democrats experienced a set back . 
11171	2370	Time will show that unloading the `` blue Dems '' was good because it is easier to target Republicans outside our party than TIME is to have internal struggle . 
11172	2370	Fact is the Republican Party does not even have a contender for President . 
11173	2370	Romney , Palin , Gingrich , Huckaby all favorites of the conservative Republican base . 
11174	2370	In the end the Republicans will be smart enough not to nominate any of them . 
11175	2370	If President Obama refused to run we have a plethoria of qualified candidates , Clinton , Biden , Reid , Pelosi , and my favorite new face , Anthony Weiner . 
11176	2370	Democrats have the end game . 
11178	2371	Im not happy with any of those candidates ... though from what ive heard of AW i might consider AW ... BO will run again though ... I hope for a republican candidate who is at least a worthy challenger ... We shall see come Election 2012 
11179	2373	Quite frankly , I have seen nothing racist . 
11180	2373	The `` Do n't tax DUDE Bro '' was a take on the line the drunk dude said to a cop , `` Do n't taze DUDE Bro '' . 
11181	2373	The Tea Party-Racism link is non-existent , and has yet to be proven . 
11182	2373	There are wackos in every group , but WACKOS do not represent the group . 
11183	2374	Are ASPECT_IRIEMON_ for Constitutional government ? 
11184	2375	ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ crack me up . 
11185	2375	What a flame-baiter ! 
11186	2376	Liberal SOP , play the race card . 
11187	2376	The photo comes from not just a liberal site but a progressive site . 
11188	2376	A site that demeans the tea party in every way PHOTO can . 
11189	2376	And the photo is from 3\/2010 OR earlier . 
11190	2376	The various tea party groups have denied racism and then the liberal media delights in calling GROUPS liars . 
11191	2376	However the tea party spoke loud enough for independents to hear in Nov. 2010 . 
11192	2376	Liberals can not hear as LIBERALS are brainwashed into deafness and blindness . 
11193	2376	But the vast majority of the American public do not suffer from the liberal looniness . 
11194	2376	And where does the photo originate ? 
11195	2376	AP , NY Times ? 
11196	2376	FOX , CNN ? 
11197	2376	No FOX originates with the progressive site FOX posted on . 
11198	2376	OTHER , supposedly , racist tea party photos have been shown to be STAGED 
11199	2378	Even that one is based on the guy that said , `` Do n't taze GUY Bro '' , to a white police officer . 
11200	2379	ASPECT_DAN40_ seem to be a bit sensitive ... I have not seen racism with the Tea Party people , PEOPLE seem like a good group of people to I , people who have taken undo criticism ... GROUP 's actually sickening to see our Administration talk negative of PEOPLE , GROUP 's disappointing ... Jollee 
11201	2381	He was lying way back when HE was campaigning , wish people had listened to HE more carefully ... We would be in allot better shape now ... 
11202	2383	Where were all ASPECT_DAN40_ guys in 2001 , or 2003 , when the government was squandering the budget surplus and running up deficits with tax cuts ? 
11203	2383	But I agree Obama has been not aggressive enough on this issue . 
11204	2383	With the country coming out of the recession , it was a mistake to cave to Republicans and let the Bush tax cuts run another two years , which will push back any meaningful progress on the deficits . 
11205	2383	Obama should also let the Bush tax cuts expire completely , and at a 5-10 % surcharge on incomes over $ 1m to help redress the damage the Bush tax cuts have caused , as well as trim spending . 
11206	2384	Great bit of facts . 
11207	2384	Always wanted to know the details , but never looked them up ... I would do one of those recommend credit things but I have no clue how ... Anyone know how ? 
11208	2385	Tell ASPECT_DAN40_ what . 
11209	2385	ASPECT_DAN40_ seem to be having a problem understanding what this thread is about , and my statements . 
11210	2385	So MY 'll dumb PROBLEM down for ASPECT_DAN40_ . 
11211	2385	The key word here is `` PERCEPTION . '' 
11212	2385	The Tea Party is `` PERCEIVED '' racist by many people who might otherwise be interested in what they have to say . 
11213	2385	ASPECT_DAN40_ want to argue this picture or that picture . 
11214	2385	Well , Google `` Tea Party , Racist , '' ASPECT_DAN40_ will find no less than 1,980,000 web sites that discuss the problem ! 
11215	2385	Most would agree that that many web sites on the subject indicates a problem . 
11216	2385	Here is a link . 
11217	2385	http:\/\/www.google.com\/#sclient=psy&amp;h...83dfe782e20cdc Now are ASPECT_DAN40_ ready to discuss the obvious problem or racism in the Tea Party , or are ASPECT_DAN40_ going to continue to ignore the reality ? 
11218	2385	Tea Party leader , Dale Robertson http:\/\/www.mediaite.com\/online\/tea-p...r-n-word-sign\/http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/TheGRAMMYs?feature=tickerIt is really easy to go with Bill Maher on this issue . 
11219	2385	The Tea Party has a public relations night mare , and PARTY will bring them down as racist . 
11220	2387	And now I 'll dumb NOW down for ASPECT_JOEY_SAC_ . 
11221	2387	Liberals PERCIEVE everyone that does not kowtow to the liberal line as RACIST . 
11222	2387	Liberals also believe that the American public is stupid and believes the lies liberals tell . 
11223	2387	And the left constantly insults the American public . 
11224	2387	I 'm amazed that liberals do not realize that the constant barrage of , `` ASPECT_JOEY_SAC_ do n't understand . '' 
11225	2387	and , `` I did n't explain BARRAGE well enough . '' 
11226	2387	ARE insults to the public 's intelligence . 
11227	2387	And the public DOES understand and liberals explained LIBERALS position to boredom . 
11228	2387	We know what ASPECT_JOEY_SAC_ 're saying and WE do n't like DOES and WE disagree . 
11229	2387	What the tea party is is the famous `` Silent Majority '' no longer being silent . 
11230	2387	The tea party got a lot of people elected in November and WILL get more people elected in 2012 . 
11231	2387	Democrats WILL lose control of all of Congress in 2012 . 
11232	2387	And the obamalama 's phony move to the center will not hold up to scrutiny for 2 years . 
11233	2387	The reality is that the tea party is effective and liberals are trying everything LIBERALS can to smear REALITY . 
11234	2387	That 's the reality . 
11235	2387	Another reality is that 99 % of our news media is liberal leftist and LIBERALS print and broadcast nothing but slurs and claims of racism by the tea party . 
11236	2387	All of that ends up on line so REALITY is no surprise that the same junk is repeated 2 million times . 
11237	2387	But a couple of unsubstantiated stories repeated 2 million times is NOT 2 million examples . 
11238	2387	MILLION just a couple of liberal lies repeated ad nauseum . 
11239	2389	Bill Maher is a misinformed moron . 
11240	2389	The Tea Party movement is not racist . 
11241	2389	There are folks from all walks of life in the movement . 
11242	2389	More folks should be , but I guess liberals like living in a bloated , bureaucratic pipe dream . 
11243	2389	Racism is always used by liberals when there really is no argument . 
11244	2391	That is an assinine statement . 
11245	2391	Show me one post of ME where ME 've called someone a RACIST for not kowtowing to the liberal line . 
11246	2391	ME 'll dumb POST down for ASPECT_DAN40_ . 
11247	2391	ASPECT_DAN40_ entire arguments are based on a strawman . 
11248	2392	Best quote I have heard in a long time . 
11249	2392	Sooo accurate . 
11250	2392	Yet again , I would like to give a recommendation thing but I do n't know how ... 
11251	2393	Thanx for the recommendation thingy . 
11252	2393	I doan no how to doit ether . 
11253	2393	Ah is technochallenged . 
11254	2395	Seriously ... Being relatively close to the middle myself and going to rallies for both parties -LRB- obviously separate elections -RRB- i can see PARTIES view point . 
11256	2395	Both sides are too far apart and there is no `` middle '' candidate so we are forced to choose between a -LRB- south park reference -RRB- turd sandwich or a -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- . 
11258	2395	Neither will help ASPECT_J.R.THEWINDBAG1_ and both will screw ASPECT_J.R.THEWINDBAG1_ . 
11259	2395	Why vote if ASPECT_J.R.THEWINDBAG1_ 're screwed either way ? 
11261	2397	YES ... . 
11262	2399	Careful there Joseph , with ASPECT_JOEY_SAC_ views on illegals ASPECT_JOEY_SAC_ could be painted with the same Brush ... But BRUSH 's all good cause they are ASPECT_JOEY_SAC_ views ... There is no more racism with THEY then any other group , and probably less then with some minority Groups ... 
11263	2402	They ca n't tell who ASPECT_LITTLELIBERTY_ voted for . 
11264	2402	So ASPECT_LITTLELIBERTY_ can add another vote to the no column ... 
11265	2403	Why would I vote no ? 
11266	2404	Why would ASPECT_LITTLELIBERTY_ vote yes ? 
11267	2405	Volumes of reasons . 
11268	2405	Here is a few . 
11269	2405	A housing bubble where billions of dollars were thrown at the problem , unresolved . 
11270	2405	A financial crisis , same process and results as above . 
11271	2405	An economy that also had over a trillion dollars thrown at CRISIS . 
11272	2405	The economy improves very slowly without a shred of positive proof that the trillion plus dollars poured in have anything to do with the recovery . 
11273	2405	Economies do EVENTUALLY recover on their own . 
11274	2405	We are now in the `` eventually '' stage . 
11275	2405	Unemployment at or over 9 % for longer than ANY other president in the entire history of the country , WHILE spending more money than any other president in the entire history of the country . 
11276	2405	National debt at the end of Clinton 's last full fiscal year , $ 5.674 trillion . 
11277	2405	National debt at the end of Bush 's EIGHT YEARS IN OFFICE , $ 10.024 trillion . 
11278	2405	A TERRIBLE increase of $ 4.35 trillion . 
11279	2405	Total accumulated national debt from George Washington through George W. Bush 's last full fiscal year . 
11280	2405	$ 10.024 trillion . 
11281	2405	Total accumulated national debt now after just over TWO YEARS OF the obamalama , $ 14.168 trillion . 
11282	2405	An incredible , insane increase of $ 4.144 trillion in just over TWO YEARS . 
11283	2405	A `` mere '' $ 206 billion more added to the debt and the obamalama will surpass Bush 's terrible 8 years of spending in WELL UNDER 3 years . 
11284	2405	That 's why to say NO to the idiot incompetent obamalama . 
11285	2405	OBAMALAMA makes Carter , Nixon , and Bush look good by comparison and they all STUNK . 
11286	2406	There 's lots of evidence it worked great . 
11287	2406	The economy stopped tanking at -7 % real and is growing for that last year . 
11288	2406	The economy stopped losing 700,000 jobs a month and the private sector has created jobs every month for the last year . 
11289	2406	The stock market stopped tanking and is up about 90 % . 
11290	2406	Even unemployment , always a lagging indicator , is improving . 
11291	2406	Only those invested in failure for political purposes could possibly say that there is no evidence government intervention worked . 
11292	2406	Without FAILURE in all likelihood we 'd be in the third year of a depression . 
11293	2407	To quote : `` Without it in all likelihood `` Was that Freudian or an admission that ASPECT_IRIEMON_ do n't know ? 
11294	2407	A FACT that both ASPECT_IRIEMON_ and I can see is that after blowing TRILLIONS , the economy is still flat . 
11295	2407	The unemployment is still high . 
11296	2407	The banks are not lending . 
11297	2407	Housing foreclosures are still terrible . 
11298	2407	Is UNEMPLOYMENT better for blowing trillions of dollars or worse for doing so . 
11299	2407	Would UNEMPLOYMENT be better had we not blown trillions that WE do not have or would UNEMPLOYMENT be worse . 
11300	2407	Neither ASPECT_IRIEMON_ nor I can provide factual proof one way or another . 
11301	2407	ASPECT_IRIEMON_ only example of such reckless spending and massive Government intervention is FDR back in the Depression . 
11302	2407	FDR took 15 years and a World War to pull ASPECT_IRIEMON_ out of that . 
11303	2407	Was the Depression that bad , or did Government intrusion cause INTRUSION to last so long ? 
11304	2407	And the obamalama 's recession compares with Reagan 's , not with the Depression . 
11305	2407	Neither Reagan 's nor BHO 's recession 's were their fault so I 'm not blaming REAGAN for the recession , just the gross mismanagement of RECESSION . 
11306	2407	What we FACTUALLY have as evidence is that WE are $ 4,144,000,000,000.00 further in debt than WE were . 
11307	2407	And housing , finance , and unemployment still awful . 
11308	2407	Remember , last summer was TO BE , `` The Summer of Recovery , '' according to Biden . 
11309	2407	WHAT recovery ? 
11310	2409	Just look at who is `` presenting opinions as facts . '' 
11311	2409	Kessy_Athena : Do n't ever apologize to DanNO40 because KESSY_ATHENA has n't the manners or the common sense to understand that discussion\/debate can ever `` trump '' DISCUSSION\/DEBATE `` opinions , '' even when ASPECT_DAN40_ quote unimpeachable , unbiased sources . 
11312	2409	I know . 
11313	2409	I 've tried . 
11314	2409	KESSY_ATHENA 's too old , too retired and too set in KESSY_ATHENA ways to ever be open minded again . 
11315	2409	Yeah , and for the most part they were ALLLLLLLL Republicans who had 6 years to deal with the problems and decided it was more important to start 2 wars and annihilate the treasury because THEY wanted to monopolize the oil in the ME for THEY rich , NeoCon cronies . 
11316	2409	HOW VERY QUICK CONSERVATIVES ARE TO FORGET ! 
11317	2409	CONSERVATIVES just LOVE to change history !!!!!!!!! 
11318	2409	CONSERVATIVES gave humongous tax breaks to the rich and most humongous corporations paid\/pay NO TAX AT ALL ! 
11319	2409	Examples : GE , Bank of America , BP et . 
11321	2409	The oil producers still get subsidies in spite of polluting the Gulf of Mexico where oil still lies 4 inches deep on the floor of the gulf . 
11322	2409	None of SPITE on the floor has been `` eaten '' by bacteria as promised and as far as anyone of us knows , the bottom of the Gulf is DEAD ! 
11324	2409	Why are ASPECT_DAN40_ still a conservative ? 
11325	2409	Bratboy Bush allowed BUSH Wall Street buddies to do BUDDIES dirty deals and then handed CONSERVATIVE over to Obama , who now must `` deal '' with the white collar multibillionaires who took the middle class to the cleaners by trashing CLEANERS pension funds with bogus `` synthetic '' securities . 
11326	2409	Just like the `` richies '' who invested with Bernie Madoff , the pension funds got greedy and Bush 's SEC cronies fired Brookslie Born for blowing the whistle on CRONIES . 
11327	2409	Why not ? 
11328	2409	MADOFF 's just a stupid woman is n't WOMAN ? 
11329	2409	And , everybody knows women have no sense for figures except for those MADOFF was born with . 
11330	2409	Once again , I agree with ASPECT_DAN40_ . 
11331	2409	When ASPECT_DAN40_ quote figures from the CBO -LRB- tho ' estimated -RRB- , I take heed . 
11332	2409	However , ASPECT_DAN40_ conservatives only take heed when the CBO gives ASPECT_DAN40_ something ASPECT_DAN40_ agree with . 
11333	2409	But , ASPECT_DAN40_ 're the first to blow `` sour '' when ASPECT_DAN40_ do n't agree with CONSERVATIVES . 
11334	2409	But , then , conservatives are just like Moby Dick , ASPECT_DAN40_ `` blow '' hard against hard facts when the wind is n't to ASPECT_DAN40_ liking !!! 
11335	2410	Thank ASPECT_SASSY_ for the unrelenting personal attack . 
11336	2410	The sad FACT , not opinion , is that ASPECT_SASSY_ attack is nearly devoid of any FACTS . 
11337	2410	But loaded with liberal brainwashed opinions . 
11338	2410	A for instance : The Republicans under Bush , ASPECT_SASSY_ CAN NOT find a post with I defending A . 
11339	2410	However just as the obamalama did not cause the recession , NEITHER did Bush . 
11340	2410	The financial and housing crises were caused almost equally by politicians of both parties . 
11341	2410	Passing some bills that caused the housing bubble and repealing some laws that would have prevented the insane financial manipulations that went on . 
11342	2410	All of ASPECT_SASSY_ so called synthetic securities can be laid at the feet of politicians of both parties long before Bush got to DC . 
11343	2410	And there is ample evidence that Bush warned about BUSH and made attempts to correct BUSH . 
11344	2410	But entrenched politicians , D & R , would not allow D . 
11345	2410	So ASPECT_SASSY_ misguided and historically inaccurate attempt to lay D all off on johnny come lately Republicans is just repeating lies that liberals have taught ASPECT_SASSY_ to tell . 
11346	2410	The problems were festering before ASPECT_SASSY_ became aware of politics at all , other than perhaps a subject in a high school curriculum . 
11347	2410	Republicans are NOT innocent in the causes of today 's problems and neither are the Democrats . 
11348	2410	So I do not fault obama for our present crisis , but I fault him for the outrageously expensive and inept way HIM has `` attempted '' to fix the problem . 
11349	2410	Maybe I forget ? 
11350	2410	What HIM did was get the Stimulus bill passed . 
11351	2410	Which was SUPPOSED to be for `` shovel ready '' projects , but OUR now know NOW was a state bailout bill . 
11352	2410	Political payback , nothing more , but to the tune of a TRILLION dollars . 
11353	2410	Once HIM had ` shoveled ' the Stimulus on OUR , HIM then IGNORED the economy entirely for going on TWO YEARS , while HIM exhausted ALL HIM political capital on passing obamalamacare . 
11354	2410	And with total control of both houses of Congress HIM had to stoop to bribes , lies , and coercion of HIM own party to get CONGRESS passed . 
11355	2410	Meanwhile if the bad economy or unemployment was mentioned , HIM was ready to write a check . 
11356	2410	NOTHING else , just throw more money at the problem until MONEY so buried in money no one can see MONEY anymore . 
11357	2410	National debt , UP $ 4.144 trillion since Bush 's last budget , how much good is that doing for the nation ? 
11358	2410	Bush increased the debt $ 4.350 trillion in 8 years and ASPECT_SASSY_ and all liberals SCREAM the horror of bush over that . 
11359	2410	Yet do n't even mutter about $ 4.144 trillion in just over 24 MONTHS . 
11360	2410	ASPECT_SASSY_ credibility with I is $ 4.144 trillion in arrears . 
11361	2410	BP and the oil spill ? 
11362	2410	Now that is Bush 's fault too ? 
11363	2410	Utter , total nonsense . 
11364	2410	UTTER happened on the incompetent obamalama 's watch and IF 4 feet of oil -LRB- doubtful -RRB- is lying on the floor of the Gulf , it is the obamalama 's job to see 4 cleaned up , not Bush . 
11365	2410	Oil subsidies ? 
11366	2410	Do ASPECT_SASSY_ know what they are ? 
11367	2410	THEY are oil depletion allowances because every barrel THEY pump out of the ground brings the oil company a barrel closer to going out of business . 
11369	2410	Probably so , but THEY were not invented by Bush . 
11370	2410	THEY were around when KID was a drunken college kid and before . 
11371	2410	Probably in effect when KID Dad was a kid . 
11372	2410	Before the tax changes in tax law in the 80 's I was invested in oil . 
11373	2410	There were excellent LEGAL , tax CREDITS available for owning oil . 
11374	2410	They took those away and I and 10 's of thousands of others , liberal and conservative , got out of oil . 
11375	2410	Do I defend I opinions ? 
11377	2410	Opinions found by experience greater than ASPECT_SASSY_ over decades . 
11378	2410	-LRB- What ASPECT_SASSY_ snidely think of as old age -RRB- Even as a school age youngster I received a better more balanced education than ASPECT_SASSY_ poor kids do now with the shambles our schools have become . 
11379	2410	I have risked I life 100 % for this country , knowingly put I life on the line . 
11380	2410	And I have willingly risked I life savings , every cent I had . 
11381	2410	ASPECT_SASSY_ have done neither . 
11382	2410	That does not make I a good person and ASPECT_SASSY_ not , PERSON could well be a much better person than I . 
11383	2410	But those all-in risks are educational . 
11384	2410	Educational about every aspect of life . 
11385	2410	Do I call I opinions facts ? 
11386	2410	No , I do not . 
11387	2410	I usually say something is a fact when NO is . 
11388	2410	I do n't often point out that I 'm voicing an opinion , but if someone has to be told that , they would n't understand the disclaimer anyway . 
11389	2412	To stop the downward spiral this country is currently engaged in . 
11390	2413	And , what do ASPECT_DAN40_ call this post of ASPECT_DAN40_ , Kudos for BONE-HEAD ? 
11391	2413	ASPECT_DAN40_ ca n't defend Bratboy because BRATBOY was the most inept President this country has seen in 50 years . 
11392	2413	Reagan was an idiot , but even REAGAN raised taxes when REAGAN saw the country going to hell in a hand basket . 
11393	2413	And , to proclaim that Bush is not responsible for the humongous debt the country has now is trying to swim in now is simply economic blasphemy . 
11394	2413	Not so !!!! 
11395	2413	Read BONE-HEAD post again . 
11396	2413	But , ASPECT_DAN40_ wo n't . 
11397	2413	On the other hand , BONE-HEAD ca n't see that the Tea-baggers have a leg to stand on for their ridiculous and unrealistic demands . 
11398	2413	`` Bone-head '' Boehner , in spite of BUBBA years in the House , ca n't get the procedure rules in the House correct in order to forward BUBBA agenda . 
11399	2413	Bottom line , BUBBA is a bogus excuse for a Speaker : BUBBA 's `` Blubbering Bubba '' at the drop of a hint of how BUBBA `` suffered '' to get to where BUBBA is today . 
11400	2413	ASPECT_DAN40_ being a former military man , ASPECT_DAN40_ must cringe at the very sight of MAN shameful visage of emotional drainage . 
11401	2413	How far our political leaders have deteriorated since Viet Nam ! 
11402	2413	The only President in recent history to serve in combat was GHWB at age 19 . 
11403	2413	Others wore the uniform but did not serve in combat . 
11404	2413	Perhaps that 's why ASPECT_DAN40_ feel compelled to brag about ASPECT_DAN40_ service . 
11405	2413	Yeah , PRESIDENT 's expected to fix in a bit over 2 years the inept governance that took Bratboy and the NeoCons 8 years to mess up with lies and idiotic decisions . 
11406	2413	Even Rummy the Dummy , in PRESIDENT new book , has ` fessed up to the disaster OTHERS inflicted on we the people ! 
11407	2413	Just ASPECT_DAN40_ opinion and others like ASPECT_DAN40_ try to make that claim stick , but even if true , PRESIDENT helped the states out of a bind . 
11408	2413	Ummmm , now who is making facts from opinion ? 
11409	2413	Ca n't ASPECT_DAN40_ get anything `` right ? 
11410	2413	CA posted 4 '' -LRB- that 's 4 inches -RRB- of oil on the floor of the gulf . 
11411	2413	That 's the report from this source : Gulf of Mexico bottom still coated in oil , recovery long way off Is this also a `` brag '' that ASPECT_DAN40_ got ASPECT_DAN40_ money out ? 
11412	2413	What has that got to do with the government continuing to pay corporate welfare to oil companies who are making astronomical profits , profits higher that at any other time in history , while Republicans stridently scream about cutting education , Medicare\/Medicaid , Social Security , etc. . 
11413	2413	What have conservatives got against the young and the old in this country ? 
11414	2413	Why do oil companies rate higher on the scale of human need than human beings ? 
11415	2413	Again ASPECT_DAN40_ presume info about BONE-HEAD that ASPECT_DAN40_ do n't `` factually '' have access to . 
11416	2413	ASPECT_DAN40_ know little to nothing about BONE-HEAD , BONE-HEAD education , BONE-HEAD age , etc. . 
11417	2413	BONE-HEAD venture to suggest that any apolitical reader on this forum who compares BONE-HEAD posts to ASPECT_DAN40_ would come away with a very different assessment of BONE-HEAD education vs. ASPECT_DAN40_ , BONE-HEAD ability to reason vs. ASPECT_DAN40_ , BONE-HEAD foundation of `` real '' facts vs. ASPECT_DAN40_ opinionated based `` facts . '' 
11418	2413	That statement is a `` Hoot ! '' 
11419	2414	Wow , ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ just noticed that when Obama became Prez ? 
11420	2416	Check back with me when ASPECT_SASSY_ learn to find the truth on ASPECT_SASSY_ own and stop acting like a high school dummy . 
11421	2416	Right now ASPECT_SASSY_ do not have a clue of what has really happened over the last 50 or 60 years . 
11422	2416	All of which are pertinent to today 's situation . 
11423	2416	What ASPECT_SASSY_ dismiss as `` old '' is knowledge gained . 
11424	2416	Something that has n't happened for ASPECT_SASSY_ yet . 
11425	2416	The way ASPECT_SASSY_ keep ASPECT_SASSY_ mind locked shut , WAY may never happen for ASPECT_SASSY_ . 
11426	2417	Ehh it still feels like he is campaigning . 
11427	2418	Obama has accelerated the spiral effect , and has taken spending and deficits to record levels . 
11428	2418	OBAMA thinks that OBAMA can spend OBAMA way out of this . 
11429	2418	OBAMA 's screwing us , whether ASPECT_LITTLELIBERTY_ admit WAY or not . 
11430	2418	ASPECT_LITTLELIBERTY_ hero is a zero . 
11431	2419	We did spend WE way out of WAY . 
11433	2420	And of course George W. Bush did none of that . 
11434	2420	BUSH 's a savior . 
11435	2420	An angel ! 
11436	2420	ANGEL put this country out of jeapordy with ANGEL tax cuts for the rich , war that killed thousands of innocent people , and knee jerk response to the worst terrorist attack in history . 
11437	2420	McCain would have continued such heroic acts for the country , with MCCAIN Godsent angel Sarah Palin -LRB- anyone that did n't vote for her is SEXIST ! -RRB- 
11438	2420	but people were STUPID and NAIVE enough to vote for the Kenyan-born OBAMA , just because HITLER 's BLACK . 
11439	2420	And now this socialist -LRB- socialism is UN-AMERICAN !! 
11440	2420	The poor people should just SUFFER ! -RRB- 
11441	2420	, Nazi , Muslim sorry excuse for a President is putting the country into a downward spiral ! 
11442	2420	NAZI going to keep ABORTION legal in the case of rape or incest , make the terrible HEALTH CARE REFORM law -LRB- ABORTION 's going to help millions of poor , unemployed people ! 
11443	2420	We ca n't REWARD people for doing NOTHING ! 
11444	2420	If ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ ca n't find a job , then too bad ! 
11445	2420	WE need to focus on helping the RICH people , that WORKED hard , not the unemployed that run to the government for help like a little baby ! -RRB- 
11446	2420	, BABY 's going to fund PLANNED PARENTHOOD -LRB- Planned Parenthood KILLS BABIES -RRB- , and-OMG-going to let GAYS and LESBIANS get MARRIED !!!!! 
11447	2420	-LRB- OHMIGOSH !!! 
11448	2420	I lie awake at night worrying about NIGHT !!!! -RRB- 
11449	2420	DO N'T vote for Obama in 2012 . 
11450	2420	OBAMA is HITLER !! 
11451	2420	HITLER 's BIN LADEN !!! 
11452	2420	DO N'T VOTE FOR OBAMA UNLESS ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ WANT THIS COUNTRY DESTROYED !!!! 
11453	2421	How does George Bush being a bad president make the incompetent obamalama a good president ? 
11454	2421	One has nothing to do with the other . 
11455	2421	The only way they COULD be connected is that if Bush had been a good president , then obama would not have been elected . 
11456	2421	Another Republican , any Republican would have been . 
11457	2421	If Bush had been good , the Republicans would not have offered up the sacrificial lamb , McCain . 
11458	2421	THEY would have run someone else . 
11459	2421	But Bush was bad , thus opening the door for an inexperienced far left radical idiot to become president . 
11460	2421	So we went from doofus , to radical idiot . 
11461	2421	That is NOT progress . 
11462	2421	The doofus added $ 4.350 trillion to the national debt in 8 years and the incompetent radical idiot WILL surpass that amount when this fiscal year ends 09\/30\/2011 . 
11463	2421	`` Bush caused the recession ! '' 
11464	2421	That is just a statement made out of ignorance of facts and history . 
11465	2421	BUSH did not cause STATEMENT but BUSH was one of a decades long line of contributors to the eventual collapse of the economy . 
11466	2421	obama did n't cause the recession either . 
11467	2421	But BUSH did TOTALLY ignore the economy for well over a year attempting `` by any means necessary '' to get BUSH health care bill passed . 
11468	2421	Yet the health care bill does n't really start kicking in until 2014 . 
11469	2421	The economy was more important and SHOULD have been BUSH priority , NOT some dream way down the road . 
11470	2421	But in retrospect , ECONOMY a good thing BUSH ignored the economy , BUSH would have made THING even worse with BUSH borrow and spend our way out of debt approach . 
11471	2421	Bush spending was terrible , obama is worse . 
11472	2421	Bush used the Patriot Act , obama kept the patriot act for OBAMA own use . 
11473	2421	Bush was vilified for the war and the ` surge . ' 
11474	2421	obama has kept the war going and did BUSH own `` surge . 
11475	2421	`` Bush was bad because of ` Gitmo . ' 
11476	2421	obama has n't closed Gimot like GIMOT PROMISED GIMOT would , in fact , GIMOT is quite happy to use GITMO . 
11477	2421	Bush was a killer for using attack drones . 
11478	2421	obama uses many TIMES more death drones than Bush did . 
11479	2421	So YES ! 
11480	2421	Bush was bad . 
11481	2421	How does that make obama good ? 
11482	2423	And if there were no mess , obama would n't be president . 
11483	2423	I did say that was the only connection . 
11484	2423	Regardless bush was bad . 
11485	2423	That does not make obama good . 
11486	2423	He 's much worse . 
11487	2423	ASPECT_SHAKER154_ do n't want to believe that but history will list HE as the worst president in modern times , maybe ever . 
11488	2423	No one can say this nation is not in deep financial trouble . 
11489	2423	No matter if ASPECT_SHAKER154_ love or hate obama , we are in trouble . 
11490	2423	And ONE does n't matter who ASPECT_SHAKER154_ want to blame , the problem STILL has to be fixed . 
11491	2423	Blaming is a gross waste of time . 
11492	2423	So what does the incompetent clown obamalama do about WE serious financial problems ? 
11493	2423	In OBAMALAMA accomplished oratory , OBAMALAMA eliminates the word spend , and replaces WORD with , `` invest . '' 
11494	2423	Once again insulting the American public with OBAMALAMA unbridled arrogance and conceit . 
11495	2424	Wow , pay attention to the entire sarcastic post . 
11496	2424	Everyone always seems to blame Obama for every single problem in this country . 
11497	2424	Most problems were there in the Bush and even Clinton years , yet no one blamed them for the problems . 
11498	2424	Now that we have a black person as President , suddenly all the right-wings are noticing `` hey , something 's wrong with this country . 
11499	2424	OBAMA DID NOW ! '' 
11500	2424	and that 's all THEM 've been saying since Obama was sworn in . 
11501	2424	`` Deficit ? 
11502	2424	OBAMA DID NOW ! 
11504	2424	OBAMA DID NOW ! 
11505	2424	High taxes ? 
11506	2424	OBAMA DID NOW ! 
11507	2424	Any flaw in the U.S. A ? 
11508	2424	OBAMA DID A ! 
11509	2424	`` That 's what the post was making fun of . 
11510	2425	We certainly did not . 
11511	2426	To the contrary . 
11512	2426	The economy was tanking at -7 % real and losing 700,000 jobs a month and the stock market was tanking and the unemployment rate was skyrocketing before the stimulus passed . 
11513	2426	Not the economy has been growing for a year and a half , jobs are being created , the stock market is up about 85 % , and the unemployment rate is declining.Bi-partisan organizations like the CBO estimate the stimulus saved or created up to over $ 3 million jobs and decreased the unemployment rate by 1.8 percentage points . 
11514	2427	ASPECT_LITTLELIBERTY_ have just ranted for an entire large paragraph about things that I never mentioned . 
11515	2427	Quit living in the past . 
11516	2427	Obama is screwing us , and ASPECT_LITTLELIBERTY_ are too blindsided to see LIVING . 
11517	2428	OK , ASPECT_IRIEMON_ keep believing that if it makes ASPECT_IRIEMON_ feel better . 
11519	2429	Look up `` sarcasm '' in the dictionary .2 . 
11520	2429	Reread my post .3 . 
11521	2429	Reread ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ post .4 . 
11522	2429	Take a look at history . 
11523	2429	The same problems ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ blame Obama for were there for a heckuva long time . 
11524	2429	ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ just did n't see HECKUVA until this `` Kenyan socialist Muslim Nazi piece of poo ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ call a president '' took office . 
11525	2429	Because while Bush was president , ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ wanted to keep living in ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ fairytale world and believe nothing was wrong with the country , just because a white Republican was in office . 
11526	2429	YOURSELF kept lying to ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ and everyone around ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ . 
11527	2430	OK , ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ keep believing that if FACT makes ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ feel better . 
11528	2430	FACT 's not a question of belief as to the changes in the economy nor as to the estimates of the bi-partisan CBO . 
11529	2430	FACT is well documented fact . 
11530	2431	The ultimate liberal standard , `` PLAY THE RACE CARD AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY . '' 
11531	2431	No wonder liberals are so happy , LIBERALS get to play the race card 3 or 4 times an hour with this clown in office . 
11532	2432	Did my post say that obama did not cause the recession ? 
11533	2432	Did POST say that or did POST not say that ? 
11535	2432	Bush ran up huge deficits and added $ 4.350 trillion to the national debt . 
11536	2432	And the liberal press crucified BUSH for PRESS . 
11537	2432	And so did FOX ! 
11538	2432	$ 4.350 trillion over 8 years is just over half a trillion per year . 
11539	2432	AND THAT IS TERRIBLE . 
11540	2432	Yet somehow the liberal press thinks that even though obama has run deficits surpassing Bush 's deficits and obama is increasing the national debt more than $ 2 trillion PER YEAR , that is OK because BUSH 's black , or for change , or is good because Bush was bad . 
11541	2432	MY 'll say PRESS slow for ASPECT_LITTLELIBERTY_ . 
11542	2432	BUSH , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , bad , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , obama , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , worse . 
11543	2433	I 'll say it slow for ASPECT_DAN40_ . 
11544	2433	The ... . 
11545	2433	problems ... . 
11547	2433	with ... this ... . 
11549	2433	... are ... . 
11550	2433	not ... . 
11551	2433	Obama 's ... . 
11554	2434	Perhaps English is not ASPECT_LITTLELIBERTY_ native language . 
11555	2434	I clearly said that obama was not at fault for the recession . 
11556	2434	However he IS at fault for the incredible , unending , list of mistakes HE has made . 
11557	2434	HE did not cause the problem as Bush did not cause the problem either . 
11558	2434	But Bush made PROBLEM worse and the incompetent idiot obamalama has trumped Bush and made a bad situation even worse . 
11559	2434	Just the money alone . 
11560	2434	Bush 's spending , The liberal media screamed about Bush 's spending . 
11561	2434	FOX screamed about BUSH spending . 
11562	2434	I screamed about BUSH spending . 
11563	2434	Did ASPECT_LITTLELIBERTY_ ? 
11564	2434	Now I scream about obama 's spending . 
11565	2434	FOX screams about obama 's spending . 
11566	2434	The liberal media does n't scream about OBAMA spending . 
11567	2434	Do ASPECT_LITTLELIBERTY_ ? 
11568	2434	Yet by 09\/30\/2011 , 7 months from now , obamalama will have increased the national debt by more actual dollars than Bush did in 8 years . 
11569	2434	But I 'm sure ASPECT_LITTLELIBERTY_ 'll pee in ASPECT_LITTLELIBERTY_ diapers and say `` ASPECT_LITTLELIBERTY_ had to spend like an insane idiot . '' 
11570	2434	Well every reckless spending politician says that . 
11571	2434	And for obamalama and every other politician MONTHS pure unadulterated bullsh ! 
11572	2434	t. That is just one thing , but THING the one thing that can ruin the nation . 
11573	2434	There is a laundry list of -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- ups the clown has done . 
11574	2434	How about the cop and the prof in Mass. . 
11575	2434	RACISM on the president 's part . 
11576	2434	The woman from the Dept of Agriculture . 
11577	2434	DEPT had WOMAN fired before knowing a fact . 
11578	2434	Reverse racism on the presidents part . 
11579	2434	Then had MSNBC and the NY Times try to blame MSNBC on FOX . 
11580	2434	How about ignoring the Constitution AND long standing bankruptcy laws and cheating the rightful creditors and giving GM away to the UAW . 
11581	2434	Or current events , sticking his uninformed and biased nose into the affairs of WI , after being afraid to say anything to Egypt AND IRAN . 
11582	2434	Or the Iranian warships now in the Mediterranean . 
11583	2434	ASPECT_LITTLELIBERTY_ can hate Bush but Iran knew if CREDITORS tried that under Bush , CREDITORS warships would soon be artificial reefs . 
11584	2434	But because obama is a weakling , CREDITORS thumbed CREDITORS nose at the USA . 
11585	2434	And that 's not a 10th of 10TH screw ups . 
11586	2434	10TH is an empty suit filled with clever recordings , but that 's evidently enough to fool ASPECT_LITTLELIBERTY_ . 
11587	2435	Obama is not the anti-Christ . 
11588	2435	Bush is not God . 
11589	2435	Open ASPECT_DAN40_ eyes for the first time , my baby , and see the world . 
11590	2436	US can not have a debate with a foolish no nothing child that is indoctrinated into liberal lies . 
11591	2436	But FOX did scream about Bush 's spending . 
11592	2436	ASPECT_LITTLELIBERTY_ were being potty trained and missed SPENDING . 
11593	2436	US screamed about Bush 's spending , then and now . 
11594	2436	Evidently ASPECT_LITTLELIBERTY_ can not read well enough see the now part and ASPECT_LITTLELIBERTY_ do n't know anything about the then part . 
11595	2436	See little girl , US retired about the same time Bush became president , but ASPECT_LITTLELIBERTY_ feel free to call US a liar . 
11596	2436	-LCB- Mod Edit : Personal insults are against the TOS -RCB- . 
11597	2436	Never have ASPECT_LITTLELIBERTY_ seen US even hint any connection between the incompetent fool -LRB- no wonder ASPECT_LITTLELIBERTY_ like FOOL -RRB- obama and Hitler . 
11598	2436	Palin was the throwaway sacrificial lamb to fill out the Republican ticket that they knew THEY were going to lose . 
11599	2436	THEY just thought THEY were going to lose to Hillary , not the clown prince of nothing . 
11600	2436	All Palin is and continues to be is a distraction . 
11601	2436	HILLARY celebrity is 100 % the fault of the left wing press . 
11602	2436	Had THEY ignored HILLARY HILLARY would be a footnote in history now . 
11603	2436	The spending ? 
11604	2436	Google or Bing the official US Treasury total of the National debt . 
11605	2436	At the end of Bush 's last fiscal year END was $ 10.024 trillion , an increase of $ 4.350 trillion over Clinton . 
11607	2436	At the end of Clinton 's last fiscal year the debt was $ 5.674 trillion . 
11608	2436	ASPECT_LITTLELIBERTY_ could look END up instead of immaturely calling anyone a liar when ASPECT_LITTLELIBERTY_ are 100 % wrong . 
11609	2436	And as of TODAY the national debt is at $ 14.175 trillion . 
11610	2436	In case ASPECT_LITTLELIBERTY_ are remedial at math and reading , that is an increase of $ 4.151 trillion . 
11611	2436	So only $ 199 Billion more and LIAR passes Bush 's total . 
11612	2436	And only $ 849 billion to pass the $ 5 trillion mark , this year . 
11613	2436	And that is 7 months from now -LRB- US fiscal year ends 09\/30 each year -RRB- . 
11614	2436	LIAR is a lock to pass Bush , the only question is how far past the $ 5 trillion mark LIAR will push the national debt THIS YEAR . 
11615	2436	ASPECT_LITTLELIBERTY_ might also check the Congressional Budget Office -LRB- CBO -RRB- official estimate of the projected debt from obama 's spending . 
11616	2436	OFFICE a shocking number , and that 's the CBO . 
11617	2436	ONES are ONES official estimators for the Government . 
11618	2436	ONES are the same ones that said obamalamacare would be deficit neutral and even might save about $ 200 billion . 
11619	2436	ONES 've since backed away from that nonsense . 
11620	2436	NONSENSE took the crazy , wasteful , reckless spending Bush 8 years to increase the debt that much . 
11621	2436	The clown obama is spending at a rate much more than twice Bush 's . 
11622	2436	And if ASPECT_LITTLELIBERTY_ claim that is not true . 
11623	2436	-LCB- Mod Edit : Personal insults are against the TOS -RCB- . 
11624	2438	Well , I have a `` bit of sense '' and a blue ribbon education to boot and what ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ imply borders on stuff espoused by conspiracy theorists like the John Birch Society . 
11625	2438	These people hate everybody ; and according to PEOPLE , anyone who disagrees with PEOPLE are `` brainwashed liberals . '' 
11626	2438	Well , investigate PEOPLE rhetoric and one soon discovers that just about every word PEOPLE utter is without foundation -- past and present . 
11627	2438	I 've been invited to PEOPLE meetings and went . 
11628	2438	PEOPLE appeal to everyone who has a grudge and GRUDGE 's always the `` liberals '' who are to blame -- ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ name GRUDGE , PEOPLE 're responsible . 
11629	2438	At one time , TIME was the `` commies '' and `` fellow-travellers , '' now NOW 's `` liberals . '' 
11630	2438	Young people are liberal because PEOPLE react to the overt and covert unfairness and injustice PEOPLE see in PEOPLE country , coming from the so-called `` adults . '' 
11631	2438	This includes often ideas and behavior PEOPLE observe coming from PEOPLE own parents . 
11632	2438	PEOPLE are brainwashed by ALL media -LRB- from kindergarden to high school and beyond -RRB- that the USA is the greatest country in the world because citizens are `` free '' to think , feel , see opportunity and be successful just by following `` the rules , '' and by working hard . 
11633	2438	Well , NONE of that is true . 
11634	2438	TALE 's a fairy tale , just like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny . 
11635	2438	By age 11 or 12 , most kids see the hypocrisy . 
11636	2438	What KIDS do then is try to affect some change to reflect the `` dream '' to help make the dream come true . 
11637	2438	-LRB- That 's what is going on in the ME right now ! -RRB- 
11638	2438	What the hell does this statement mean ? 
11639	2438	STATEMENT does n't make any sense ! 
11640	2438	No one who has seen photos of the holocaust could make this statement . 
11641	2438	ONE 's so totally `` off line . '' 
11642	2438	ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ forum name is certainly apropos because only an `` anarchist '' -LRB- meaning `` outlaw '' -RRB- could stomach that kind of political . 
11643	2438	This statement describes Bratboy Bush to the `` Tea '' party , more than to Obama . 
11644	2438	How could Obama with just a bit over 2 years in office have made a record like the one ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ opine ? 
11645	2438	As for ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ `` boy '' Terry Lakin , BOY suggest LAKIN web site is more a strong plea for contributions than for `` truth . '' 
11646	2438	Every source ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ post here is , without question , HARD HARD RIGHT WING NUTS ! 
11647	2438	No one with even an ounce of `` common sense '' would accept this `` Junk '' rhetoric as anything more than `` Junk '' food fried up for mentally challenged ideologues . 
11648	2438	ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ have some nerve complaining about Obama when ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ offer up this cholesterol jammed greasy snake oil to anyone ! 
11649	2439	If anyone is an `` ass '' here , it is the one who ca n't handle the truth ! 
11650	2439	And , ASPECT_DAN40_ , DanNO have a struggle with the simple truth that others point out to ASPECT_DAN40_ . 
11652	2439	She 's referred to SHE as a `` Mama Grizzly '' and a pit bull wearing lipstick , but `` sacrificial lamb '' is not in SHE vocabulary . 
11655	2439	Naughty , naughty . 
11656	2439	Must ` nt call people names because NAUGHTY is n't polite on this forum . 
11657	2439	Tho ' ECONOMIST know of one that allows such things and even more `` dirty '' words than ASPECT_DAN40_ can think to spout . 
11658	2439	Look , DanNO40 , ECONOMIST can agree with ASPECT_DAN40_ about the spending . 
11659	2439	ECONOMIST have been called `` cheap '' for ECONOMIST adherence to fiscal responsibility . 
11660	2439	ECONOMIST say ECONOMIST am `` frugal '' and let ADHERENCE go at that . 
11661	2439	ECONOMIST consider ECONOMIST a very responsible `` saver '' and `` investor '' -LRB- For example , ECONOMIST bought Apple when ADHERENCE was $ 14 a share . 
11662	2439	ECONOMIST pat ECONOMIST on the back every day for that bit of insight . -RRB- 
11663	2439	ECONOMIST am NOT an economist . 
11664	2439	Most economists ECONOMIST have had experience with are `` air '' heads , meaning ECONOMISTS are all theory and not realists . 
11665	2439	So much for the likes of Bernanke , Greenspan , Volker et . 
11667	2439	-LRB- Tho ' ECONOMIST was gratified that Greenspan finally ` fessed up about LIBERTARIAN idol Libertarian , Ayn Rand , had got THO wrong -RRB- . 
11668	2439	But , ECONOMIST also think that success in business does not guarantee that that person is qualified to govern a country . 
11669	2439	Too very different jobs . 
11670	2439	A CEO 's only job is to make a good profit . 
11671	2439	A President or other leader of a country must provide for `` the people 's best interest , way of life and protection of life . '' 
11672	2439	Very different obligations . 
11673	2439	IOW , A CEO 's first obligation is to make money for the shareholders . 
11674	2439	A President 's first obligation is to promote the people 's welfare from birth to death . 
11675	2439	ECONOMIST think Obama has tried to do that . 
11676	2439	Further , ECONOMIST do n't expect OBAMA to be `` perfect '' particularly in the light of OBAMA predecessor 's inept performance . 
11677	2439	ECONOMIST 've said before that ECONOMIST am an Independent -- and ECONOMIST am . 
11678	2439	ECONOMIST happen to know and respect one very able and competent Republican Senator , Richard Lugar . 
11679	2439	ECONOMIST also know and respect another very able and competent long time Democratic Senator , Carl Levin . 
11680	2439	Both , are brilliant and above all , politically reasonable and responsible . 
11681	2439	ECONOMIST personal recollection of these two well behaved politicians is that POLITICIANS are rubbing POLITICIANS collective heads in dismay at what is going on in Washington today . 
11682	2439	ECONOMIST feel bad for what POLITICIANS must cope with in today 's political climate . 
11683	2439	As David Letterman would say , `` LETTERMAN would n't wish that on a monkey sittin ' on a rock . '' 
11684	2440	ASPECT_SASSY_ words about economists are the most reasonably intelligent posts ASPECT_SASSY_ have made . 
11685	2440	There are a couple of know nothing clowns on another thread that tried to say that I did n't know anything about business because I would n't hire an economists . 
11686	2440	Even after I pointed out to ECONOMISTS that economists make up less than 3\/10thoudandths of the private sector workforce . 
11687	2440	I disagree that the president 's job is to promote the people 's general welfare from birth to death . 
11688	2440	PRESIDENT job is to take care of the nation so that people can promote PEOPLE own welfare . 
11689	2440	ASPECT_SASSY_ may think that is the same thing , I believe otherwise . 
11690	2440	Providing an atmosphere where both large and small , union and non-union companies could hire again would allow PEOPLE to provide for PEOPLE . 
11691	2440	Instead PRESIDENT has pursued a leftist agenda , providing actual welfare rather than promoting anything but PRESIDENT own agenda . 
11692	2440	And the spending , that PRESIDENT shows no sign of even truly acknowledging , is a knife in the heart of the nation . 
11693	2440	And PRESIDENT predecessors ineptness , is a given . 
11694	2440	Now how does that make obamalama anything more or less than PRESIDENT is ? 
11695	2440	Bush was inept , obamalama is more so . 
11696	2440	I 'd greatly prefer that was not the case . 
11697	2440	I 'd prefer that we had a capable Chief Executive , but having been a CEO and having interviewed and hired executives . 
11698	2440	I would not hire BHO for anything above middle level sales . 
11699	2440	And I 'd have BHO immediate supervisor watch BHO very closely since I never allowed any salesman to sell on anything but quality and service . 
11700	2440	And I 'd be very wary of BHO overselling with loads of BS . 
11701	2440	And what Letterman says is unimportant . 
11702	2440	I do n't know why LETTERMAN sold out LETTERMAN talent to the liberal left , but LETTERMAN did . 
11703	2440	Ayn Rand was a Russian . 
11704	2440	Most likely had experiences that neither her fans nor HER distractors ever will have . 
11705	2440	HER was an excellent author . 
11706	2440	I 've enjoyed many if not all of her books . 
11707	2440	FANS are fiction . 
11708	2440	No different than the movies , make believe . 
11709	2441	All of ASPECT_SASSY_ credit just went out the window . 
11710	2441	ALL of it . 
11711	2441	Do ASPECT_SASSY_ even understand the things Regan did for this country ? 
11712	2441	Of course ASPECT_SASSY_ do n't . 
11713	2441	In fact , ASPECT_SASSY_ probably were n't even alive during REGAN presidency . 
11714	2441	Please refrain from polluting this beautiful blog network with completely inane claims such as this . 
11716	2443	Do n't try to blame MEMBER for ASPECT_SASSY_ posts ! 
11717	2443	There is ASPECT_SASSY_ inexperience and naivety showing through . 
11718	2443	Can ASPECT_SASSY_ say Carter or Nixon ? 
11719	2443	And there is that reading challenge rearing INEXPERIENCE ugly head . 
11720	2443	MEMBER CLEARLY said Bush increased the debt by $ 4.350 trillion in 8 years , and that to do so was terrible . 
11721	2443	But ASPECT_SASSY_ want to make excuses for the obamalama increasing the debt by $ 4.151 trillion in just over 1\/4th of that time . 
11722	2443	Where is the logic or intelligence in that ? 
11723	2443	The obamalama will surpass Bush 's awful spending in just a few WEEKS , and OBAMALAMA will have increased the debt by more than $ 5 trillion by the end of this fiscal year 9\/30\/2011 . 
11725	2443	MEMBER mention MEMBER service only as an example of one of many learning EXPERIENCES ASPECT_SASSY_ have not had and can not imagine . 
11726	2443	Many of which help develop a very accurate bullsh ! 
11727	2443	t detector , which the incompetent clown obamalama sets off on an ongoing basis . 
11728	2443	Show MEMBER where MEMBER said BHO is bad for not fixing the economy in the time BHO 's had . 
11729	2443	MEMBER complaint is that BHO singular approach , pour money over APPROACH , has not worked and that BHO spent more than half BHO presidency ramrodding a bad bill that even BHO own party had to be bribed and threatened to pass . 
11730	2443	There was and is a crushing priority in the country and PRIORITY is NOT health care . 
11731	2443	But BHO had to ignore the economy while BHO had the control of both Houses of Congress . 
11732	2443	Understandable , but a complete failure of judgment . 
11733	2443	Even the obamalama hisownself has admitted that `` shovel ready '' projects were a myth . 
11734	2443	That 's not good enough for ASPECT_SASSY_ ? 
11735	2443	When the POTUS admits POTUS , MEMBER 'm still voicing an opinion ? 
11736	2443	That 's amazing . 
11737	2443	Plus , HISOWNSELF had NO business bailing out any state without the consent of the American people . 
11738	2443	But HISOWNSELF did bail out states , Democrat states primarily , with a `` bait and switch '' Stimulus bill . 
11739	2443	BAIT WAS supposed to create jobs . 
11740	2443	Covering a states past due bad debts is not creating jobs . 
11741	2443	And MEMBER guess we are even , ASPECT_SASSY_ do n't ` remember ' that Nixon was a bad president . 
11742	2443	And MEMBER do n't remember that Kissinger was ever president . 
11743	2443	A horse and a horse . 
11744	2443	ASPECT_SASSY_ `` source is `` Gone with the Wind . '' 
11745	2443	And ASPECT_SASSY_ would lose that venture . 
11746	2443	ASPECT_SASSY_ posts reveal all about ASPECT_SASSY_ . 
11747	2443	IDEOLOGUE are a closed minded ideologue that is n't ever aware that LIBERAL are a far left liberal . 
11748	2443	ASPECT_SASSY_ choose to ignore facts when ASPECT_SASSY_ find them inconvenient , and little or nothing ASPECT_SASSY_ say is from ASPECT_SASSY_ own intellect . 
11749	2443	Now if ASPECT_SASSY_ wish to claim that MEMBER am also a closed minded ideologue , MEMBER will admit that has some merit . 
11750	2443	But at one time MEMBER was a member of a union , more than one , and a registered Democrat . 
11751	2443	MEMBER gave that up long before FOX went on the air . 
11752	2443	MEMBER gave up on liberals and Democrats after observing what LIBERALS do and the results of what DO do . 
11753	2444	Palin is an ass who 's celebrity is totally the fault of the left wing media attempting to outdo each other by mocking her . 
11754	2444	Had the leftist media just ignored HER after the election , HER 'd be a footnote now . 
11755	2444	But what does Palin being a genius or a dolt have to do with obama ? 
11756	2444	If Palin was terrific , that would n't make obamalama bad . 
11757	2444	PALIN does that to PALIN . 
11758	2444	And Palin being an ass does n't make the clown obamalama good either . 
11759	2444	One has nothing to do with the other . 
11760	2444	ONE liberal loony-ism to attach any cause and effect to any connection between them 
11761	2445	Sorry I neglected to add this in I earlier post . 
11762	2445	These numbers are NOT I opinion . 
11763	2445	However we can safely say that statements like : '' oil companies who are making astronomical profits , profits higher that at any other time in history , '' are strictly ASPECT_SASSY_ opinion . 
11764	2445	The gross incompetent clown 's 2 big `` Industries of Evil . 
11765	2445	`` OIL Industry , NET profit margin 11.8 % HEALTH CARE PLANS , Net profit margin 3.3 % Net profit margins of some other industries , not part of the `` Industries of Evil . 
11766	2445	`` Beverages , Brewers-18 % Industrial metals -- 17.9 % Drug Mfgs . 
11767	2445	-- 16.9 % Cigarettes --------- 15.8 % Agricultural Chem.-15 .2 % Info & delivery Ser.-13 % Education & train.-11 .5 % Wireless Comm . 
11768	2445	----- 10.8 % Gen. Entertainment-8 .6 % Soft Drinks -------- 6.7 % Auto Parts Stores -- 6 % Recreational Vech-5 .1 % But according the the clown prince , OIL at 11.8 % and health insurance at 3.3 % are the villains ! 
11769	2445	When in reality , VILLAINS are just easy targets for VECH-5 to lie about to the ignorant . 
11770	2449	Yes the race will be close because he is superb at campaigning to be president . 
11771	2449	HE is so good at RACE HE has never stopped campaigning to be president . 
11772	2449	RACE a shame that HE is so bad at being the president . 
11773	2450	ASPECT_LITTLELIBERTY_ have mistaken me for a Bush fan . 
11774	2450	ME voted for FAN , but realized that FAN had problems of FAN own . 
11775	2450	ME could n't wait for FAN to be out of office by the end of FAN second term . 
11776	2450	Obama is accelerating the decline of our country . 
11777	2450	The only thing slowing OBAMA down , is the Republican controlled House . 
11778	2450	Luckily , OBAMA could n't even get all that OBAMA wanted passed when the Dems controlled everything . 
11779	2450	Now who 's in fairytale land and lying to everyone around them ? 
11781	2451	All I have seen is an ever-increasing bureaucracy in Washington . 
11782	2451	The Public sector , unfortunately , is where the growth is . 
11783	2451	The economy is stagnating , jobs are not being created like ASPECT_IRIEMON_ think , and the unemployment rate is still dismal . 
11784	2451	I have serious doubts as to whether or not the stimulus did anything except to increase our deficits . 
11785	2452	ASPECT_DAN40_ seem to be ignoring a few key facts . 
11786	2452	After Bush wrecked the economy revenue drastically increased , and Obama has also needed to spend a lot to stimulate the wrecked economy , so the direct comparisions to Bush are intellectually dishonest . 
11787	2452	Bush had no excuse for what BUSH did . 
11788	2452	Tax cuts for the rich and 2 unneccessary wars are what blew up the deficit . 
11789	2453	The republicans are slowing him down ? 
11791	2453	Which party held unemployment benefits hostage so the bush tax cuts could be extended and blew another 800 billion hole in the deficit ? 
11793	2453	REPUBLICANS are the ones trying to destroy this country , which REPUBLICANS did for 8 years but now REPUBLICANS really want to finish NOW off because an Obama failure , is the only way to fool the sheep into voting REPUBLICANS back into power . 
11794	2453	Which party ensured the financial reform bill was as weak as -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- and ineffective ? 
11795	2453	Again the republicans , and the result will be another crash . 
11796	2454	Whine out obamalama excuses all ASPECT_TARRANT_ wish , but as bad as Bush was , the incompetent clown obamalama is worse . 
11797	2454	MUCH WORSE . 
11798	2454	Comparing Bush and the clown is comparing dumb and dumberer . 
11799	2454	The seeds of the destruction of the economy were planted long before Bush showed up . 
11800	2454	Bush was ineffective in stopping those seeds from sprouting . 
11801	2454	And the clown obamalama is even worse at correcting the economy . 
11802	2454	But that is not DID fault . 
11803	2454	DID is a politician and it is politicians that caused to economy to be set up to collapse over some decades . 
11804	2454	So while NOT fixing the economy is not obamalama 's fault . 
11805	2454	Running up enormous debt in the process IS DID fault . 
11806	2454	THERE is no arguing or excusing the debt numbers . 
11807	2454	Bush increased the debt by $ 4.350 trillion over 8 years . 
11808	2454	The last 2 years and the highest increases were under total Democrat control -LRB- including the rookie , JUNIOR Senator obama -RRB- But Bush DID sign the increases . 
11809	2454	And since the end of Bush 's last full fiscal year , the debt has increased by another $ 4.2 trillion . 
11810	2454	So in this SHORT time the incompetent clown fool obamalama , has increased the debt by nearly as much as Bush did in 8 years . 
11811	2454	And for a kicker the clown fool has just submitted a budget that KICKER LIES and says BUDGET will reduce deficits by $ 400 . 
11812	2454	billion while the debt will increase by $ 7 TRILLION . 
11813	2454	We can file the fool obamalama under the heading , `` Be Careful What ASPECT_TARRANT_ Wish For ! '' 
11814	2455	The economy is not stagnating , ECONOMY 's growing . 
11815	2455	About 3 % real last year . 
11816	2455	A big improvement over the -7 % decline in early 2009 . 
11817	2455	ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ may have serious doubts , but the economic data showing a turnaround in the economy and the fact that the CBO has calculated the stimulus saved or created millions of jobs is not a matter of belief , but a matter of record . 
11818	2455	ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ can find the data on economic growth at : BEA . 
11819	2455	govYou can find the data on unemployment at : http:\/\/www.bls.gov\/webapps\/legacy\/cpsatab1.htmYou can see stock market performance here : http:\/\/www.google.com\/finance?client...DEXDJX:grin:JIYou can see CBO reports on the stimulus here : http:\/\/www.cbo.gov\/publications\/coll...cfm?collect=12 
11820	2456	So ASPECT_DAN40_ actually denying that in a recession , goverment revenue drops drastically ? 
11821	2456	, and that in a recession it is vital for the goverment to spend to stimulate the economy ? 
11822	2456	ASPECT_DAN40_ are disagreement with basic economic fundamentals im afraid . 
11823	2457	Bush inherited a budget surplus and squandered SURPLUS , running up $ 5 trillion more debt . 
11824	2457	Obama inherited a great recession and most of the debt OBAMA has incurred is because of that . 
11825	2457	Whether OBAMA can preside over a meaningful deficit reduction with the House in control of Republicans who refuse to consider increasing revenues will remain to be seen . 
11826	2457	But I have always been critical of Obama 's relatively lax attitude toward the budget -LRB- though OBAMA was the only president in decades to actually reduce spending last year -RRB- . 
11827	2457	It was a reason I supported Clinton . 
11828	2457	Unfortunately , McCain gave no reasonable alternative . 
11829	2458	To which of the 50 or so `` basic economic fundamentals '' do ASPECT_TARRANT_ refer ? 
11830	2458	Not that 50 matters since every one is `` theoretical . 
11831	2458	`` Prior to this economic downturn , the one where ASPECT_TARRANT_ spent the most government money , took from 1929 until 1946 and a World War to correct . 
11832	2458	Other times government has lowered taxes and got out of the way of the private sector to allow the economy to recover on WAY own , and WAY has . 
11833	2458	And here is a `` basic economic truth '' for ASPECT_TARRANT_ . 
11834	2458	This present recession is 100 % the fault of long term meddling in business by politicians of both parties . 
11835	2458	Politicians , no matter what label POLITICIANS attach to POLITICIANS caused the housing , financial and securities troubles with laws POLITICIANS have passed and laws POLITICIANS repealed . 
11836	2458	To look to politicians to correct the problem that POLITICIANS ignore POLITICIANS created is the height , or depth , of folly . 
11837	2459	Just out today for ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ : US manufacturing activity hits 2004 highWASHINGTON &#8212; US manufacturing grew for the 19th straight month in February as a jump in employment and production drove activity to a nearly six-year high , a key industry survey showed Tuesday . 
11838	2459	Employment also rose 2.8 percentage points , to 64.5 percent , climbing above 60 percent `` for only the third time in the last decade , '' Ore said . 
11839	2459	http:\/\/www.google.com\/hostednews\/afp...01ac4be9a7.45119 months ago MONTHS was July 2009 , about 3-4 months after the stimulus passed . 
11840	2459	Mere coincidence ? 
11841	2459	Our conservative friends would have ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ believe that . 
11842	2459	The bi-partisan CBO says otherwise . 
11843	2461	I will not be voting for this idiot Obama . 
11844	2461	And for the Dems to be up in arms over what 's going on in Wisconsin is fairly hypocritical after all the things OBAMA and Pelosi shoved down the American peoples throats ! 
11845	2461	I am betting we get a Newt Gingrich\/Allen West ticket elected in 2012 ! 
11846	2462	The ones I directly referred to in I post . 
11847	2462	Revenue dropping in a recession is not theoretical , FACT established basic fact . 
11848	2462	Not sure why ASPECT_DAN40_ debating economics when ASPECT_DAN40_ dont even understand the basics . 
11849	2462	When ASPECT_DAN40_ say ` meddling ' I hope ASPECT_DAN40_ are referring to the deregulation that allowed the financial sector to run wild and eventually impode . 
11850	2462	DEREGULATION a direct result of not enough goverment meddling or regulation . 
11851	2462	that caused the problem , and the republicans have ensured , the problem remains not fixed , although PROBLEM almost certain that Obama also never wanted PROBLEM fixed OBAMA becauuse that would upset OBAMA corporate masters . 
11852	2463	I am certain that I understand economics far better than ASPECT_TARRANT_ . 
11853	2463	Yes Government revenue is very likely to drop in a recession . 
11854	2463	But the revenue did not drop by $ 4 trillion dollars . 
11855	2463	And Govt spending is but one possible way to help in a recession . 
11856	2463	And it is possibly the worst way , as every dollar the Government spends is a dollar taken out of the economy , since the economy IS the source of the govt money . 
11857	2463	The so called deregulation was the repeal of long standing effective regs for new regs of political expediency . 
11858	2463	And ASPECT_TARRANT_ can forget about Republicans taking the blame . 
11859	2463	And I AM NOT a Republican , and never have been a registered Republican , but once was a registered Democrat . 
11860	2463	BOTH parties caused our present day problems . 
11861	2463	Not with deregulation but with exchanging good regulations for bad regulations . 
11862	2463	Some wise and well considered regulation is necessary . 
11863	2463	But creating Securities out of sub-prime loans is not good regulation . 
11864	2463	Nor is passing laws that led to the creation of sub-prime loans . 
11865	2463	And the new financial regulations are a hastily slapped together mish-mash of ill considered political posturing that will cause more problems than SOME solve . 
11866	2463	And will cost the public untold millions of dollars in unnecessary bureaucratic fees . 
11867	2463	And those `` corporate masters '' certainly should be Flogged on an hourly basis . 
11868	2463	Look what THOSE do to MASTERS . 
11869	2463	Provide essentially all of the nations jobs . 
11870	2463	Pay the bulk of MASTERS taxes . 
11871	2463	Provide every good , product , and service ASPECT_TARRANT_ desire . 
11872	2463	ASPECT_TARRANT_ should skip trying to talk economics when ASPECT_TARRANT_ have n't the first shred of a clue what economics are about . 
11873	2464	Goverment spending goes back into the economy , ECONOMY not taking out , and if SPENDING directed properly SPENDING has the best stimulus multiplier . 
11874	2464	Unemployment benefits for example is maybe the highest multiplier because SPENDING spent so quickly and so many different industries profit from SPENDING . 
11875	2464	What in ur opinion is a better way to stimulate demand in the economy , other than directly creating jobs programs or giving money to the people to spend ? 
11876	2464	Let me guess , tax cuts ? 
11877	2464	PEOPLE sure helped the economy in the last decade didnt PEOPLE ? 
11879	2464	In other words deregulation , as reducing restrictions and control of what the financial industry can do . 
11880	2464	WHAT ok THEY can say the word . 
11881	2464	Again thats all called deregulation , and ME agree both sides are to blame . 
11882	2464	No they dont , not the richest few percent . 
11883	2464	They play a strong factor in all these areas though but that does not justify THEY bribing and corrupting the political system and exploiting the country . 
11884	2466	de reg u late -LRB- d-rgy-lt -RRB- tr . 
11885	2466	v. de reg u lat ed , de reg u lat ing , de reg u latesTo free from regulation , especially to remove government regulations from : If ING was the right word I would not hesitate to use ING . 
11886	2466	But replacing a good regulation with a bad one is still regulation , not deregulation . 
11887	2466	The politicians did not create a situation where `` anything goes ! '' 
11888	2466	POLITICIANS created one where SITUATION was regulated to `` only ridiculous nonsense that can not possibly last , goes ! 
11889	2466	`` Politicians can not conceive of the idea of actual DEregulation . 
11890	2466	To a politician , every thing must be regulated to POLITICIANS own best advantage . 
11891	2466	The media misuses the word deregulation , and many others , often . 
11892	2467	If Obama would have produced the real change OBAMA promised OBAMA would not be so detested even by OBAMA prior supporters . 
11893	2467	This country does need real change . 
11894	2467	So sorry to see that Obama did n't deliver anything but our tax dollars to the crooks . 
11895	2467	I expected as much from bush etc but not Obama . 
11897	2468	Intent and perception might be important if the The tea party was failing . 
11898	2468	However they are doing the opposite , instead of failing THEY are kicking political butt and taking names . 
11899	2468	Why should THEY change anything ? 
11900	2468	Oh my friend , if ASPECT_JOEY_ like Google try Googleing ` Tea party succeeds ' and ASPECT_JOEY_ can pick from About 134,000,000 results -LRB- 0.40 seconds -RRB- . 
11902	2469	Very true . 
11903	2469	I think ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ speak for many with those words . 
11904	2471	What really needs to happen is making the BANKING system less tyrannical . 
11906	2471	but nevermind . 
11907	2472	I ca n't think of any . 
11908	2473	How does that pic equate to racism , let alone any connection to less government , lower taxes , and skin color ? 
11909	2473	Try again . 
11910	2474	Good point . 
11911	2474	Why would anyone thing the photo of Obama dressed as a African medicine man has anything to do with race at all ? 
11912	2474	Good Lord . 
11913	2475	Is that picture from the tea parties site ? 
11915	2475	Lower taxes and smaller government does n't have anything to do with race . 
11916	2475	Again , epic fail by US . 
11917	2475	Show us where the ideals of the tea party invoke race . 
11918	2476	-LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- , MDF we are agreeing too much ! 
11919	2476	Ha ha . 
11920	2476	The only thing I have changed is to attempt to explain I core ideas with a bit more detail , I am happy that WE have found some common ground . 
11921	2476	At first I was very optimistic about Obama . 
11922	2476	However , I noticed some things that put I at unease , still I hoped . 
11923	2476	Then , I learned of OBAMA voting record on late term abortion and other -LRB- moral\/religious issues -RRB- that gave I even more reason to drop OBAMA . 
11924	2476	Finally , I dropped I support for Obama even before the nations financial problems and before OBAMA tried to appease the GOP etc. . 
11925	2476	Thanks for ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_ reply ~ ra 
11926	2477	Ignorance is bliss . 
11928	2477	and ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ must be very blissfull . 
11929	2477	The housing bubble was caused by Bush due to : Lowering interest rates to zeroIncreasing the money supplyAllowing Credit Default Swaps -LRB- CDS 's -RRB- made legal in 2000 after being illegal since the eary 1900 ` sGiving mortgages to people with no creditThere were rumors about Freddy and Fanny insolvency as early as 2005 . 
11930	2477	By the time Obama got in . 
11932	2477	the first two years spending was already committed . 
11934	2477	One does not turn the titanic around on a dime . 
11935	2477	Now however Bush can be blamed no more . 
11936	2477	What needed to be done in this years budget is massive spending cuts . 
11938	2477	that needs to include cuts to military spending and the philosophy of trying to police the world . 
11939	2477	The only place I here this comming from is the Libertarian party . 
11941	2477	and . aint gettin elected . 
11942	2477	Blame ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ for not voting for . . 
11944	2477	and misplacing the blame . 
11946	2478	Those that summarily condemn the tea party using only MSNBC and or Open Society Foundation flavor instant koolaid propaganda as a catalyst -LRB- just add ignorance -RRB- reminds FAN how mind warping powerful a good propagandist machine can be . 
11947	2478	FAN am no fan of FOX or any large news organizations \* . 
11948	2478	\* -LRB- The news of today that is NBC CBS FOX MSNBC ETC , is in actuality fluff and entertainment productions with varying amounts of fabrication and choreographed for the entertainment of target audiences . 
11949	2478	While there is some information buried in these productions , INFORMATION often times difficult to determine when the fluff leaves off and the real news begins -RRB- . 
11950	2478	The big news organizations are strangely similar to religion and atheism ! 
11951	2478	Ha ha ... lets see ... FOX are the Christians , MSNBC are atheist with the others filling in the middle -RRB- FAN know what ` ORGANIZATIONS ' will say and that is that Whites are better off and need less government assistance , while blacks are less well off and need government assistance , or words to that effect . 
11952	2478	And maybe that 's true , but HA has nothing to do with racism but everything to do with an unfair societies and world governments that are led by greed and the love of money . 
11953	2478	As long as that situation continues our fate is grimly predictable IMO . 
11955	2480	Liberals and blacks will claim LIBERALS are uncle toms for not supporting Obama . 
11956	2480	LIBERALS will probably also claim ASPECT_DAN40_ are lying or LIBERALS were paid to be there lol . 
11957	2482	Well what if PALIN is n't Palin on the ticket ? 
11958	2482	And most signs lead to here not being on the ticket ... 
11959	2484	Palin has had her day in the sun . 
11960	2484	HER continued notoriety is fueled by the leftist media not being able to resist saying something bad about HER . 
11961	2484	Thus keeping HER in the news . 
11962	2484	There is not a single Republican bigwig that would want HER on the ticket . 
11963	2484	And I would HATE for HER to be on the ticket , I 'm a registered Independent . 
11964	2484	But if HER was on the ticket , then I 'd have to think . 
11965	2484	Do I vote for HER , thinking HER is a loose cannon , and an unknown quantity . 
11966	2484	Or do I vote for the incompetent obamalama knowing that he is not able to do the job ? 
11967	2484	I 'd have to go with the unknown quantity rather than the known failure , obamalama . 
11969	2484	After 12 years of GWB and BHO , is n't YEARS time somebody capable runs for President . 
11970	2484	Do n't we deserve a good one after 12 years of suffering fools ? 
11971	2486	Ha ha ! 
11972	2486	Indeed why did ASPECT_DAN40_ let em get away ? 
11973	2486	Some tea partier ' ASPECT_DAN40_ are ! 
11974	2486	On a serious tangent I must say I do n't often do rallies , I detest crowds and organized events , well save for gun shows , ha ha that comment probably damages I cred to the liberals here , but HA fairly true ! 
11975	2486	Anyway I beleive the reason that blacks are not well represented at most tea party events has nothing to do with intentional racism . 
11976	2486	SUBJECT may be the subject of the speech etc. and that BLACKS may not feel comfortable , just as I sometimes do not feel well at what appears to be an all black gathering . 
11977	2486	Even though I comment may be raciest or sound somewhat racist in saying IE , ie the raw words , COMMENT 's not meant to be racist , COMMENT simply from the heart . 
11979	2487	Blacks are over 90 % PRO obamalama . 
11980	2487	And thus , few , have any interest in attending a tea party rally . 
11981	2487	That somehow makes the tea partiers racist according to libraloonies . 
11982	2488	Actually they are more like 99 % Obamalama ... OBAMALAMA 's terrible . 
11983	2488	And whites are the racists ... 
11984	2489	It was 95 % , and blacks have gone over 90 % for Democratic candidates at least for the prior two elections -LRB- Kerry and Clinton -RRB- . 
11985	2489	ASPECT_JTHORP24_ are clueless . 
11986	2490	Well actually it was 96 % ASPECT_AGENT_ZERO_ are clueless , but we all know that since OBAMALAMA are an Obamalama ASPECT_AGENT_ZERO_ . 
11987	2490	ASPECT_AGENT_ZERO_ fit into that dumb 96 % . 
11988	2491	His ancestry is from an African nation . 
11989	2491	What 's the problem ? 
11990	2491	My ancestors are from the Netherlands . 
11991	2491	If ASPECT_IRIEMON_ photo-shopped a photo of MY wearing wooden shoes and rolling a wheel of cheese , would that be a problem in ASPECT_IRIEMON_ eyes ? 
11992	2491	Not mine . 
11993	2491	No racism . 
11994	2492	Perhaps ASPECT_GIFTEDONE_ forgot about the Repubs warning about the problems with Fanny and Freddie , and how the Dems thought that all was good . 
11995	2492	Obama is taking a can opener to the Titanic . 
11996	2494	Like Bush 's response to the only bill ever passed by either chamber of the Republican controlled Congress in 2005 : the Administration opposes the billOoops . 
11997	2494	Before Obama : the stimulus the economy was tanking at a -7 % real rate , losing 700,000 + jobs a month , unemployment was skyrocketing , and the stock markets were crashing . 
11998	2494	Now : the economy has been growing steadily for a year and a half , the private sector has created jobs every for more than a year , stock markets are up about 90 % , and the unemployment rate is falling . 
11999	2494	That ship was turned around . 
12000	2494	Pretty handy use of a can opener . 
12001	2495	If ignorance is bliss , PERSON must be the happiest person on the planet . 
12002	2495	The spending already committed ? 
12003	2495	Are PERSON kidding . 
12004	2495	The phony STIMULUS BILL . 
12005	2495	obama 's first huge error . 
12006	2495	Passed by a partisan Democrat vote -LRB- no House Republicans for , Senate 3 Republicans for -RRB- at obama 's insistence . 
12007	2495	And perhaps ASPECT_GIFTEDONE_ do not remember that Democrats controlled both Houses of Congress from January 2007 until January 2011 . 
12008	2495	Not majority , but total control for Bush 's last 2 years in office . 
12009	2495	And perhaps ASPECT_GIFTEDONE_ also forget that the Stimulus Bill , ARRA , was supposed to be for `` shovel ready `` projects to repair the infrastructure according to obama . 
12010	2495	That was all a lie . 
12011	2495	The money was used to cover the Democrat states budget shortfalls . 
12012	2495	http:\/\/stimuluswatch.org\/2.0\/And the housing bubble was put in motion decades before Bush was Governor of Texas . 
12013	2495	By both Democrats and Republicans trying to buy votes from those unable to buy housing . 
12015	2497	GLUTTON am not a glutton for punishment ... 
12016	2498	I never said Bush was ideal . 
12017	2498	BUSH had BUSH problems . 
12018	2498	There may be signs of recovery in spite of Obama . 
12019	2498	Do n't get too cocky yet . 
12020	2498	We may be in for more hurt . 
12021	2498	Of course , that will be Bush 's fault , right ? 
12022	2499	Bush was half as bad as Obama ! 
12023	2499	Obama is three times as worse as Bush , with that said I rest I case ... Jollee 
12024	2501	If I had a choice between the two , I would pick Bush , but I dont trust BUSH , I think BUSH is just as bad as Obama ... JolleeJollee 
12025	2502	To me , both Obama and Bush are puppets . 
12026	2502	PUPPETS are both controlled by others , whether it 's unions\/all those Soros groups or the big oil companies with Bush . 
12027	2502	ME want a president that is does n't pander to anyone . 
12028	2503	I agree ! 
12029	2503	I wish Paul Ryan or Chris Christi would run for president , mostly Paul Ryan RYAN is so good looking and smart , that 's what we need to win ... Paul Ryan ! 
12032	2505	Hello , he can only play one significant ! 
12033	2505	I want the mathematician , the fact numbers man ! 
12034	2505	as well as intelligent , good looking , etc. ... I want Paul Ryan too run ! 
12035	2505	Joelle , past Demo , Moderate Republican , Paul Ryan for President ! 
12036	2506	Yes I often get accused of racism by the people including one or three members here that are A + students in the university that produced libraloonie \* PhDs . 
12037	2506	-LRB- that is the University of MSNBC and similar propaganda spewing organizations -RRB- . 
12038	2506	The charge of racism and other belittling terms leveled at Tea Partiers and other grass root groups are rarely justified . 
12039	2506	However happily those calls are becoming less and less robust as PARTIERS are systematically being discredited and the name callers ie the real haters in this play are being exposed for what CALLERS are , that is liars and hatemongers . 
12040	2506	ra -LRB- DISCLAIMER ; I use libraloonies and other derogatory word to denote the fringe of liberals not the moderate liberals of whom I have many friends . 
12041	2506	Indeed I decry most if not all extreme fringe groups right left or middle , because when one is at the fringe , the extreme fringe , that eliminates all options to be rational and much like a particle approaching light speed the closer to c -LRB- c is light speed in a vacuum -RRB- the more extreme the fringe the less options one has to be rational . 
12042	2506	-LRB- a particle approaching light speed gains mass at 90 % of c not too much mass is gained however at 95 % c the particle has gained 10000 % PARTICLE mass or weight , at 99 % PARTICLE gains millions of times PARTICLE mass , and the speed of light is never attained because the amount of energy required for 100 % light speed is more energy than is in the entire universe ! -RRB- 
12043	2506	hmmm ... perhaps that was a bad analogy ? 
12044	2506	hee hee ... ahhhh ` ra 
12045	2507	Hi Jollee long time no font ha ha ... Anyway DETESTER too would like a fact and numbers too , but Paul Ryan ? 
12046	2507	RYAN has too much hair , and if ASPECT_JUSTIN_VALUABLE_ think RYAN is good looking what does a bald , bearded , and pierced guy have with ASPECT_JUSTIN_VALUABLE_ ? 
12047	2507	-LRB- just kidding ... hey JUST Monday we need something to smile about ! -RRB- 
12049	2507	Right on ~ right on brother ! 
12050	2507	DETESTER am a Soros detester , well DETESTER religion prevents DETESTER to detest the man , DETESTER detest MAN sinful and terrible nation busting ways along with MAN need to control WE . 
12051	2507	The only good thing about Soros -LRB- and SOROS various organizations of which Open Society is SOROS Flag Ship -RRB- is that the old fool is OLD ! 
12052	2507	Perhaps SOROS will die soon and find out for sure if God -LRB- or perhaps the other guy -RRB- exists or not ! 
12054	2508	Yes but if the banks would of been watched by the congress and the regulatory groups that we elected to do that WE would not be in this mess nor would GROUPS of had the melt down that nearly plunged WE into a depression that would have made the 1920 's look like a overdrawn checking account -LRB- but not for the reasons told to the public , thats another thread -RRB- . 
12055	2508	I think WE will eventually start a medium to world war to put the 700 billion -LRB- more like two trillion dollars in real money etc -RRB- and more that WE plugged in to the currency and then stupidity gave to the same crooks without regulation . 
12056	2508	That funny money cash infusion did narrowly avert a catastrophic failure if ASPECT_MAGICALFIRE_ beleive in looney toons . 
12057	2508	But what I am trying to say is that the real crooks are the very people WE elected -LRB- Congress up to the commanders in chief IMO -RRB- in bed with the very most rich -LRB- is the Goldman Sachs of poo etc -RRB- . 
12058	2508	So yes YES the banks but YES far more . 
12059	2508	PEOPLE are both the crooks and the symptoms of a disease called GREED and as Jesus said , the LOVE of money is the root of all evil . 
12061	2509	True true TRUE ! 
12062	2509	I will get called a guess what ? 
12063	2509	A racist for saying this but if whites did or said half what some blacks did and do the Media would be shouting RACIEST RACIEST RACIEST !!! 
12064	2509	One out of thousands of examples ? 
12065	2509	Here let Google do the talking ; New Black Panther thugs head back to polls ; Democrat panelist ... Oct 29 , 2010 ... Before the Philly New Black Panther Party radicals showed up at a voting booth in 2008 with billy clubs and racial epithets at the ready , ... http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/note.php?not...46984540676&amp;id..What if the KKK did the same thing ? 
12066	2509	Holy crap HERE would have been a riot and the police would have shut NBP down with a SWAT response . 
12067	2509	No POLICE am 100 % against the old Klan just like the NBP movement . 
12069	2510	With all due respect I beleive J was using the 99 % figure as a talking point and was not meant to be taken seriously . 
12071	2512	Maybe that was his plan . 
12072	2513	Paul Ryan and Christie are also puppets . 
12073	2513	Dr. Ron Paul is the only man to trust . 
12074	2513	Check out PAUL voting record over the last thirty years . 
12075	2513	Proof is in the facts ! 
12076	2515	I like Ron Paul for his position on isolationism , PAUL isn t a true isolationist but is the nearest thing we have . 
12077	2515	If ASPECT_DRILLER80545_ dig Paul -LRB- as I do -RRB- take the time to read this ; http:\/\/www.swamppolitics.com\/news\/po..._isnt_wha.htmlra 
12078	2516	Not bad but we need someone that is electable . 
12079	2516	I like Huckabee for many reasons , a primary reason is HUCKABEE faith . 
12080	2516	Yes I know that gives many people shudders and a nervous tic to go with TIC ! 
12081	2516	And while the relgious right will vote for Huck just for that reason , many moderates will run away for the same reason . 
12082	2516	I would love to see Huckabee and Mccain -LRB- HUCKABEE age and hawkness ' is a liability -RRB- for a GOP ticket . 
12083	2516	However and get ready to Gag , I personal favorite not being a Republican nor a Democrat etc would be Ron Paul and ? 
12085	2516	a ha no. . 
12087	2516	hmmm ' ~ ra 
12088	2517	Huckabee would be my choice . 
12089	2517	HUCKABEE faith matters little to MY , but HUCKABEE 's a mean bass player ! 
12090	2518	Why use ` Nazi Germany ' as a comparison . 
12091	2518	I thought we got into the war because the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor ? 
12092	2519	We did . 
12093	2520	ASPECT_METAL_HEAD_ am happy that ASPECT_METAL_HEAD_ can see past the mans faith . 
12094	2520	ASPECT_METAL_HEAD_ beleive if everyone were like ASPECT_METAL_HEAD_ -LRB- not religion phobic -RRB- , Huck would be electable . 
12095	2520	HUCK may still be because the religious right is quite a voting block . 
12096	2520	Personally speaking , if two men were running and one was a complete dweeb in politics but a true christian , ie pro life pro second amendment pro traditional values etc , and the other was a brilliant politician but a pro abortion anti firearm anti traditional values dweeb ASPECT_METAL_HEAD_ would vote for the christian every time . 
12097	2520	Scary huh ? 
12099	2521	Who knows the real reason we finally got into WW2 ? 
12100	2521	If WE were living in my dream world where the entire western hemisphere were isolated -LRB- except for cultural and knowledge sharing -RRB- MY would find non-interference a difficult concept to adhere if the world was at war and say another Hitler was winning , not to help WE fellows . 
12101	2521	However , if WE former allies knew from the beginning that non-interference was WE policy MY think obeying that policy would be morally and ethically correct . 
12102	2521	Anyway , are ASPECT_ONETHUNDER_ responding to this ? 
12103	2521	; '' &#8220; Well , first off , Iraq is not Nazi Germany , &#8217; &#8217; Paul said today on CNN &#8217; s Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer . 
12104	2521	&#8220; And besides , MY thought it was Hitler that caused World War II , not the American people , who opposed going in . 
12105	2521	So &#8220; did n't make any sense . 
12106	2521	And then HITLER was awfully confused about isolationism versus non-intervention . 
12107	2521	There is a big difference . 
12108	2521	&#8220; Isolationism is n't what MY advocate , &#8217; &#8217; Paul told Blitzer . 
12109	2521	&#8220; MY advocate non-intervention , not getting involved in the internal affairs of other nations , and not pretending a country like Iraq is equivalent to Nazi Germany . 
12110	2521	Iraq had no army , no navy , had no weapons of mass destruction , had nothing to do with 9\/11 , so the comparison makes no sense . 
12111	2521	`` If not what do ASPECT_ONETHUNDER_ mean by ASPECT_ONETHUNDER_ comment ? 
12112	2521	Thanks for ASPECT_ONETHUNDER_ reply ... ra 
12113	2522	Not really , i would too . 
12114	2524	I would consider ASPECT_METAL_HEAD_ I brother then , unless ASPECT_METAL_HEAD_ religion is LaVey satanism or those that would do violence to others as a matter of doctrine . 
12116	2525	ME agree with most of the excerpts conclusions . 
12117	2525	That will surprise some members that know ME . 
12118	2525	Many people mistake me for a radical right wing conservative republican . 
12119	2525	ME am none of those things really . 
12120	2525	ME religion is Open Theist Christian \* . 
12121	2525	ME reality\/paradigm is determined by ME religion , which leads to the misconception that ME am conservative etc. . 
12122	2525	ME think all the political parties are ultimately corrupted by the love of money . 
12123	2525	ME religion based paradigm is simplistic but accurate\/true . 
12124	2525	For example , in physics SIMPLE isn &#8217; t the complex equations that give us the best answers to things , but rather SIMPLE 's the very most simple and elegant ones that describe complex things better ! 
12125	2525	Case in point ; E = MC2 ! 
12126	2525	The same thing holds true when trying to assess a complex system like US political system with SYSTEM seemingly infinite myriad branches trunk and roots that are the life support that is the bewildering complex botany of plants . 
12127	2525	So US must look at the tree as a whole and not try to take TREE apart . 
12128	2525	Sorry ME got off on a tangent ! 
12129	2525	Anyway there is nothing complex about US failures , every one of them can be traced back to Greed and the love of money , just as a great man\/God once said about 2000 years ago . 
12130	2525	\* Open Christian theism can best be described as liberal Christianity . 
12131	2525	US still must validate US beliefs by scripture but non traditional answers and such are accepted and studied where in an ordinary seminary or church those ideas would be summarily rejected . 
12133	2527	Yes 96 was 96 , but if ASPECT_JTHORP24_ really want to see the racism RACISM 's in his approval numbers . 
12134	2527	I checked a while back to Carter none of those guys were in the ninety 's except Obama , I believe if I remember correctly CARTER always had about a 7 point advantage . 
12135	2527	Now here GUYS are , no jobs , , nothing and CARTER is still over 90 % approval with GUYS , , , go figure . 
12136	2527	That means the least THEM do for them the more GUYS like ASPECT_JTHORP24_ , , , -LRB- If ASPECT_JTHORP24_ black that is -RRB- HAHAHAHAHAHAnybody that says heavy racism is not involved is just full of crap , GUYS are sooo frightened to be un PC THAT 's nuts ... or rather GUYS dont have nuts ... Now this is what GUYS want ASPECT_JTHORP24_ to believe , the people with the highest percentage wise on welfare , the people with the highest crime percentage , the people with the heaviest arrest percentages would never stoop so low as to be prejudice ... HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Yup , , , that 's where GUYS draw the line ... GUYS would never treat a white person unfairly , murder , dope , prostitution , rape , , but Prejudice ? 
12137	2527	... NEVER !! 
12138	2527	LOLIt 's sad , THEM just can not trust anything from many a Liberals mouth , just like with them trying to condemn the Tea party when LOLIT 's THEM involved in all the violence , and the stopping of free speech as well . 
12139	2527	So besides all the crap MANY do MANY out right lie about LOLIT as well , even when LOLIT is put right in front of MANY ... MANY know MANY are not fooling anybody , I guess MANY figure what else MANY got to lose , and if MANY catch people out there that are ignorant enough MANY may get MANY to believe MANY garbage . 
12140	2527	Man , I am glad I am not in that mess . 
12141	2527	Somebody compared MANY party to Donkey Kong the other day ... LOL 
12142	2528	The Dems knew exactly what they were doing , how do ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ make one of the largest transfers of wealth ? 
12143	2528	Real estate , , make the middle class lose fortunes on the values on THEY homes , and who steps in to profit from MIND ? 
12144	2528	, why MIND 's the poor , now those homes are affordable , never mind that ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ just stole MIND from the middle class who needed that money to retire ... Yup , , , real slick ... and most people do not even question MIND ... Remember Barny 's goal , make housing affordable to the poor , , , , BARNY just did . 
12145	2529	MEMBER hate Obama . 
12146	2529	So does MEMBER wife . 
12147	2529	So do MEMBER sons . 
12148	2529	MEMBER 'm the only white member of MEMBER family . 
12149	2529	Am MEMBER a racist and SONS are n't ? 
12151	2529	Obama is the living breathing embodiment of American leftism and we hate American leftism with WE beings . 
12152	2529	If that makes MEMBER multi-racial family racist then that 's fine with WE . 
12153	2529	ASPECT_FLOUNDER_ dilute the meaning of the word `` racist , '' and by doing so ASPECT_FLOUNDER_ weaken the approbation . 
12154	2529	MEMBER suspect that was n't ASPECT_FLOUNDER_ intent . 
12155	2529	Think about MEANING . 
12156	2531	the 180 who voted yes are brainwashed americans who need to stop listening to that idiot box in the lving room what BOX tells them , that idiot box is nothing but a TOOL for the government . 
12157	2531	The ONLY candidate people should vote for is Ron Paul . 
12158	2531	Here is WHY people should not vote for Obama or any of the other candidates except Paul . 
12159	2531	take two hours to watch this out of ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ day , I know ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ all have the time Obama lovers . 
12160	2531	YouTube - The Obama Deception HQ Full ... 
12161	2532	Hi Albert , , weakening the word ? 
12162	2532	, , Look at my post count Al , think , been around and know this place ? 
12163	2532	That word was diluted two days after Obama was elected , MY been called that every day for two years , and everybody else on the right as well . 
12164	2532	ASPECT_ALBERT_DI_SALVO_ know the game , if ASPECT_ALBERT_DI_SALVO_ disagree with Obama ASPECT_ALBERT_DI_SALVO_ a racist , if ASPECT_ALBERT_DI_SALVO_ have them cornered in a debate ASPECT_ALBERT_DI_SALVO_ a racist or Bigot . 
12165	2532	If ASPECT_ALBERT_DI_SALVO_ even mention Arizona ASPECT_ALBERT_DI_SALVO_ are both . 
12166	2532	So , , when ASPECT_ALBERT_DI_SALVO_ come here ASPECT_ALBERT_DI_SALVO_ speak '' PF '' , EITHER THAT OR JUST LAY DOWN AND DO N'T POST . 
12167	2534	Hi ' 9\/11WAIJ ' . 
12168	2534	PROPONENT\/SUPPORTER am a cautious proponent\/supporter of Ron Paul , however PAUL will have to change a few things before PROPONENT\/SUPPORTER could vote for PAUL with a clear conscious . 
12169	2534	PROPONENT\/SUPPORTER watch TV news for entertainment value only , knowing that they are selling a product etc. . 
12170	2534	So brother , PROPONENT\/SUPPORTER do PROPONENT\/SUPPORTER can -LRB- kinda -RRB- with what PROPONENT\/SUPPORTER have . 
12171	2534	PROPONENT\/SUPPORTER do have computer access obviously , a short wave and conventional radios , and most importantly a brain that works intermittently when not blinded by the rage and lusty desire to choke the ever loving -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- !!! 
12172	2534	\*\* !! -RRB- 
12173	2534	out of some fool who somehow manages to anger PROPONENT\/SUPPORTER beyond PROPONENT\/SUPPORTER ability to keep from writing something like the above ! 
12174	2534	-LRB- ha ha -RRB- , yes HA a fantasy and PROPONENT\/SUPPORTER have never in PROPONENT\/SUPPORTER decades on this planet actually harmed anyone for expressing their feelings . 
12175	2534	~ ra ~ -LRB- !!! 
12176	2534	\*\* !! -RRB- 
12177	2534	~ Please forgive PROPONENT\/SUPPORTER for the use of such foul language and worse , the more foul thoughts Jesus . 
12178	2534	That includes PROPONENT\/SUPPORTER beloved forum brothers and sisters , ASPECT_9/11_WAS_AN_INSIDE_JOB_ know PROPONENT\/SUPPORTER love ASPECT_9/11_WAS_AN_INSIDE_JOB_ and the father more than this flash in the pan so called life here on earth , again PROPONENT\/SUPPORTER apologies to all that PROPONENT\/SUPPORTER offended , and God bless all of ASPECT_9/11_WAS_AN_INSIDE_JOB_ that are struggling just to survive mentally physically and simply to make ends meet , PROPONENT\/SUPPORTER love all of ASPECT_9/11_WAS_AN_INSIDE_JOB_ , we will prevail because WE are all Gods children IMO ~ 
12179	2535	ASPECT_FLOUNDER_ points are generally well taken . 
12180	2535	I apologize for I abrasive of ascerbic terms and words . 
12181	2535	I misunderstood ASPECT_FLOUNDER_ prior post . 
12182	2537	No problem ... I have read many of ASPECT_ALBERT_DI_SALVO_ posts , , I find ASPECT_ALBERT_DI_SALVO_ interesting . 
12183	2537	I was reading one thread in particular where ASPECT_ALBERT_DI_SALVO_ were having trouble in ASPECT_ALBERT_DI_SALVO_ neighborhood , , I feel bad for ASPECT_ALBERT_DI_SALVO_ . 
12185	2537	I always took train when I was working , and worked in a bad area for over thirty years . 
12186	2537	DAY 's like day and night living in I neighborhood and the station that I office was near . 
12187	2537	I always hated the fact I had to dress down when I went to work , if ASPECT_ALBERT_DI_SALVO_ did n't ASPECT_ALBERT_DI_SALVO_ stood a good chance of getting robbed . 
12188	2537	Awful days we are Living in Al , , , mighty awful ... I was having a problem keeping I office door open to get some fresh air inside , so I purchased a very unusual Lamp chain , ONE was the only one long enough for I purpose , , so I attached DAYS and DAYS worked . 
12189	2537	I employee said , , '' Boss ASPECT_ALBERT_DI_SALVO_ cant leave that chain half outside like that MIGHTY will steal DAYS , I said for God sakes DAYS 's only a small Lamp chain , she said LEAVE does n't matter LEAVE 's shiny , , I laughed ... Following day FOLLOWING was gone , I did n't know if I should burst out Laughing or get so angry I wanted to choke somebody . 
12190	2537	I mean really a Lamp chain ? 
12191	2537	and CHAIN was screwed on to an outside wall of the office , MIGHTY had to rip CHAIN out and cause damage . 
12192	2537	Who could be that stupid ? 
12193	2537	who could need a Lamp chain that bad ? 
12194	2537	who could care that little about another persons property ? 
12195	2537	PROPERTY was absurd . 
12196	2537	That afternoon I walked to the Deli to get lunch and there was the usual bunch of ill mannered trouble making Bastards in there . 
12197	2537	I noticed one kid he was about ten I guess , KID was wearing I chain around KID neck with pride ... This is what we are up against , and if ASPECT_ALBERT_DI_SALVO_ stay on these pages long enough ASPECT_ALBERT_DI_SALVO_ will learn how that entire incident was I fault . 
12198	2537	ASPECT_ALBERT_DI_SALVO_ see some time a hundred years ago some white guy had slaves ... Well ASPECT_ALBERT_DI_SALVO_ know the rest of the story . 
12199	2537	Al , had I walked in I house as a kid and had that chain around I neck I parents would have said ... '' Whats that ? 
12200	2537	, where did ASPECT_ALBERT_DI_SALVO_ get that from ? 
12201	2537	, did ASPECT_ALBERT_DI_SALVO_ buy AL ? 
12202	2537	, where did ASPECT_ALBERT_DI_SALVO_ get the money ? 
12203	2537	what store ? 
12204	2537	I am telling ASPECT_ALBERT_DI_SALVO_ Sir , the more we coddle people like that , the more PC WE dump out there the worse PC will get , and SIR 's already worse I guess the word I am looking for is worster ... LOL PEOPLE have to look into PEOPLE , PEOPLE have to recognize the problem and admit ONE , not to I but to PEOPLE . 
12205	2537	SIR 's the home . 
12207	2537	-LRB- If ASPECT_ALBERT_DI_SALVO_ want to call . that -RRB- , these kids are having kids without being kids yet KIDS ... KIDS have no regard for anybody only KIDS , WE were humble toward WE adults , KIDS attack KIDS , WE were respectful , KIDS talk trash , WE were there to help , KIDS help KIDS . 
12208	2537	Calling things as WE see KIDS is not wrong , what 's wrong is ignoring , making excuses , and expecting no better ... THAT 'S WRONG ! 
12209	2537	If KIDS do not fix these homes this country will blow sky high and all the AA , and welfare checks wont make a difference , after all KIDS have been taught KIDS deserve KIDS and KIDS actions are WE responsibility , there are no consequences for KIDS , respect is not something ASPECT_ALBERT_DI_SALVO_ earn , COUNTRY is gotten through intimidation or demanded for ASPECT_ALBERT_DI_SALVO_ by the Government . 
12210	2537	The resentments are held deep inside and not voicing the outrage is not only not healthy for society but COUNTRY will give ASPECT_ALBERT_DI_SALVO_ agida ... -LRB- Italian heartburn -RRB- . 
12211	2537	I am not saying ASPECT_ALBERT_DI_SALVO_ run around with a broad brush all day but when ASPECT_ALBERT_DI_SALVO_ see something so obvious there is nothing wrong in stating so , otherwise how do KIDS even know BRUSH 's wrong ? 
12212	2537	WE are aware and know most times BRUSH is not corrected in the household so in the balance WE are doing the same thing ... ONES are now the ones ignoring the chain ... . 
12213	2539	Off hand I would say ASPECT_DIXIEHUNTER_ are fairly certain ... . 
12214	2540	This is patently racist hate speech ! 
12215	2540	No wonder people call ASPECT_FLOUNDER_ a racist . 
12216	2540	This post , in POST entirety , is n't sarcasm POST 's just revolting , repulsive , and hateful . 
12217	2540	People are people - no matter what color PEOPLE are . 
12218	2540	Most people , if not all , are prejudiced about someone or something , but the stuff written in this post is beyond forgiveness or even common sense . 
12219	2540	KID was a kid in the Detroit race riots in 1967 . 
12220	2540	We lived in an urban Catholic Polish neighborhood with some Hispanics . 
12221	2540	KID stepfather was a Army scout in the Philippines in WWII for 2 years when the average life span in that assignment was less than 3 months . 
12222	2540	PERSON was a expert marksman and about as tough as HISPANICS come . 
12223	2540	PERSON and one other American soldier worked and lived with the Philippine Aborigine insurgents against the Japanese . 
12224	2540	PERSON had to kill people to stay alive . 
12225	2540	Yet , PERSON was the most gentle , fair-minded person KID have ever known . 
12226	2540	In civilian life , PERSON was a letter carrier and loved PERSON job . 
12227	2540	When PERSON died , more than 300 people showed up at PERSON funeral . 
12228	2540	PERSON taught KID respect for all people and that those who hate and spout hate think THOSE have good reason to do so , but hatred wo n't change the world into what THOSE want . 
12229	2540	PERSON told KID that common sense and understanding can and does change attitudes . 
12230	2540	Life is not fair to anyone . 
12231	2540	Not economically , physically , intellectually . 
12232	2540	No one promised ME or me a rose garden without thorns in ONE . 
12233	2543	No , that would be Bush . 
12234	2544	His Presidency is n't even over yet . 
12235	2544	That 's rather presumptuous of ASPECT_OLDJAR07_ . 
12236	2545	It 'll be both . 
12237	2546	Obama will be worse than Bush . 
12238	2547	Not possible . 
12239	2548	What 's so bad about Bush ? 
12240	2548	If ASPECT_MAGNUM_ say the economy , what has Obama done to improve ECONOMY . 
12241	2548	If ASPECT_MAGNUM_ say the war in Iraq and Afghanistan , why are we still there ? 
12242	2549	Wrongly elected , stupid , was tied to oil and gas companies , environmental policies sucked , too many vacations , tied his Christianity to politics , patriot act and loss of freedoms , bad economic policy led to rising debt , should not have privatized social security , was not respected abroad , never admitted to bad decisions . 
12243	2549	Shall i go on ? 
12244	2550	I think it the world will look disparagingly at Obama , if WORLD ever gets off WORLD puffed up PC color coddling butt . 
12246	2551	That list nearly described every president in history . 
12247	2551	As far as binding his Christianity to HIS politics thank God HIS did that . 
12248	2551	Personally I think the modern west which includes the USA England etc is a manifestation of Templar era Christianity ie the Crusaders and Christendom in general . 
12249	2551	We have the historical DNA of the crusaders in WE blood . 
12250	2551	\* Being proud of ones religion and even allowing RELIGION to influence some policy is a lot better Obama 's immoral unethical ways and OBAMA like instilled goon squad of hair ball advisers . 
12251	2551	Throw in Obamas broken promises , OBAMA lying unethical ways , and ASPECT_MAGNUM_ will have a visual of the man that Obama really is . 
12252	2551	Oh I forgot to add OBAMA is inexperienced -LRB- excutivally speaking -RRB- . 
12253	2551	I think Obama was far worse than Bush . 
12254	2551	I am no fan of the Iraq war , but somewhat support the Afghanistan war . 
12255	2551	As a Christian I I admire Bush for being proud that OBAMA is a Christian , Obama on the other hand is anything that BUSH needs to be , black , white , oreo , late term abortion champion ... no thanks ! 
12256	2551	I would go so far to say that Obama is our worst president in since James Buchanan , no. . 
12258	2551	. is worse than even that buffoon . 
12259	2551	. color is of no consequence , but . ignorance , stupidity and naivety is . 
12260	2551	\* again this is speaking in purely abstract terms and generalities . 
12261	2551	We also have Muslim blood etc. . 
12264	2552	Barack Obama , during OBAMA Cairo speech , said : `` OBAMA know , too , that Islam has always been a part of America 's story . '' 
12265	2552	AN AMERICAN CITIZEN 'S RESPONSE : Dear Mr. Obama : Were those Muslims that were in America when the Pilgrims first landed ? 
12266	2552	Funny , I thought they were Native American Indians . 
12267	2552	Were those Muslims that celebrated the first Thanksgiving day ? 
12268	2552	Sorry again , those were Pilgrims and Native American Indians . 
12269	2552	Can ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ show I one Muslim signature on the United States Constitution ? 
12270	2552	Declaration of Independence ? 
12271	2552	Bill of Rights ? 
12272	2552	Did n't think so . 
12273	2552	Did Muslims fight for this country 's freedom from England ? 
12275	2552	Did Muslims fight during the Civil War to free the slaves in America ? 
12276	2552	No , NO did not . 
12277	2552	In fact , Muslims to this day are still the largest traffickers in human slavery . 
12278	2552	ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ own half brother , a devout Muslim , still advocates slavery MUSLIM , even though Muslims of Arabic descent refer to black Muslims as `` pug nosed slaves . '' 
12279	2552	Says a lot of what the Muslim world really thinks of ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ family 's `` rich Islamic heritage , '' does n't LOT Mr. Obama ? 
12280	2552	Where were Muslims during the Civil Rights era of this country ? 
12281	2552	Not present . 
12282	2552	There are no pictures or media accounts of Muslims walking side by side with Martin Luther King , Jr. or helping to advance the cause of Civil Rights . 
12283	2552	Where were Muslims during this country 's Woman 's Suffrage era ? 
12284	2552	Again , not present . 
12285	2552	In fact , devout Muslims demand that women are subservient to men in the Islamic culture . 
12286	2552	So much so , that often WOMEN are beaten for not wearing the ` hajib ' or for talking to a man who is not a direct family member or WOMEN husband . 
12287	2552	Yep , the Muslims are all for women 's rights , are n't WOMEN ? 
12288	2552	Where were Muslims during World War II ? 
12289	2552	WOMEN were aligned with Adolf Hitler . 
12290	2552	The Muslim grand mufti MUSLIM met with Adolf Hitler , reviewed the troops and accepted support from the Nazi 's in killing Jews . 
12291	2552	Finally , Mr. Obama , where were Muslims on Sept. 11th , 2001 ? 
12292	2552	If MUFTI were n't flying planes into the World Trade Center , the Pentagon or a field in Pennsylvania killing nearly 3,000 people on our own soil , MUFTI were rejoicing in the Middle East . 
12293	2552	No one can dispute the pictures shown from all parts of the Muslim world celebrating on CNN , Fox News , MSNBC and other cable news networks that day . 
12294	2552	Strangely , the very `` moderate '' Muslims who 's asses ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ bent over backwards to kiss in Cairo , Egypt on June 4th were stone cold silent post 9-11 . 
12295	2552	To many Americans , MUFTI silence has meant approval for the acts of that day . 
12296	2552	And THAT , Mr. Obama , is the `` rich heritage '' Muslims have here in America ... Oh , I 'm sorry , HERITAGE forgot to mention the Barbary Pirates . 
12297	2552	HERE were Muslim . 
12298	2552	And now we can add November 5 , 2009 - the slaughter of American soldiers at Fort Hood by a Muslim major who is a doctor and a psychiatrist who was supposed to be counseling soldiers returning from battle in Iraq and Afghanistan . 
12299	2552	That , Mr. Obama is the `` Muslim heritage '' in America . 
12300	2552	EVERY AMERICAN MUST READ THIS !! 
12301	2552	Be sure to SEND NOW TO ALL . 
12302	2552	Muslim Heritage , I ass umption . 
12303	2553	Color has nothing to do with COLOR , unless ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ 're a racist . 
12304	2554	Color does have something to do with it and ASPECT_SEA_LION_ need not be racist to believe that unless ASPECT_SEA_LION_ believe all the blacks who voted for Obama because of OBAMA skin color are racists . 
12305	2554	Obama was given a pass for most of the first part of OBAMA term because of OBAMA skin color . 
12306	2554	OBAMA was supposed to be the ` golden child ' , the one to bring the races together . 
12307	2554	Instead , OBAMA has pushed the races further apart . 
12308	2554	OBAMA has done this by such things as jumping into the cop and professor case and declaring the police force idiots without knowing what had actually happened in the case . 
12309	2554	OBAMA has done this by allowing OBAMA justice department to not prosecute the New Black Panther Party members who intimidated voters at the polls . 
12310	2554	OBAMA has done this by referring to OBAMA white grandmother as a ` typical white person ' . 
12311	2554	Obama 's presidency has proven to be an unmitigated disaster and the question asked at the title of this thread should be changed from , Will ASPECT_SEA_LION_ vote for Obama in 2012 , to , Will anyone vote for Obama in 2012 ? 
12312	2555	ASPECT_OLDJAR07_ rhetoric only applies to 3 of the above . 
12313	2555	Only Bush and Obama have been presidents , so how can ASPECT_OLDJAR07_ judge the other 3 as presidential material ? 
12314	2555	I voted for Obama . 
12315	2555	I did not vote for OBAMA because OBAMA is black , but because OBAMA proved during the debates that McCain was a fool -LRB- especially with MCCAIN pick for VP in ditherhead Palin -RRB- meaning , `` there 's no fool like an ` old ' fool . '' 
12316	2555	Further proof is McCain 's record since the election which is even worse than MEANING was before the election . 
12317	2555	As for who `` screwed '' up the country , there can be no worse jerk than the other ditherhead , Bratboy Bush . 
12318	2555	FOR totally relied on Cheney , another `` stoup '' who used FOR wife 's money and WIFE family to get ahead in politics because FOR could n't get anywhere on FOR own . 
12319	2555	FOR truly is the human face of Darth Vader , except Vader was a fictional warrior and Cheney never was . 
12320	2555	This is the guy who shot a friend in the face and then had the friend apologize for being in front of gun . 
12321	2555	Cheney has always had a `` heart '' problem . 
12322	2555	Now NOW 's truly as `` artificial '' and empty as CHENEY brain was from birth . 
12323	2555	Two shriveled pea brains in a shriveled pee pod : Bratboy Bush and `` Dick '' Cheney . 
12324	2555	They and the REPUBLICAN Neocons are 100 % responsible for the absolutely asinine dilemma the USA is in today -LRB- a recession caused by out of control Wall Street greed , negligent Republican appointed regulators and enforcers , and a Republican inspired , balloon-headed notion that the USA could control the oil fields in the M E just because THEY are the lone super power . 
12325	2555	Nobody else , even the simple minded Dems can take credit for this mess . 
12326	2555	SIMPLE ALL belongs to the Republicans . 
12327	2555	And anyone who tries to explain this mess away the way conservatives and the addlebrained tea party is trying to do is . 
12328	2556	What a load of horse -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- ! 
12329	2556	Muslims have been part of American history since pre-Columbus times . 
12330	2556	Indeed , early explorers used maps that were derived from the work of Muslims , with EXPLORERS advanced geographical and navigational information of the time . 
12331	2556	Some scholars estimate that 10-20 percent of the slaves brought over from Africa were Muslims . 
12332	2556	The film `` Amistad '' alluded to this fact , portraying Muslims aboard this slave vessel trying to perform SCHOLARS prayers , while chained together on deck as SCHOLARS crossed the Atlantic . 
12333	2556	Personal narratives and histories are harder to find , but some stories have been passed on from reliable sources : Omar Ibn Said -LRB- ca . 
12334	2556	1770-1864 -RRB- was born in the Muslim state of Futa Toro in Western Africa , in present-day Senegal . 
12335	2556	MUSLIM was a Muslim scholar and trader who was captured and enslaved . 
12336	2556	MUSLIM arrived in South Carolina in 1807 , and was sold to James Owen of North Carolina . 
12337	2556	Sali-Bul Ali was a slave on a plantation . 
12338	2556	ALI owner James Cooper wrote : `` ALI is a strict Mahometan -LRB- sic -RRB- ; abstains from spirituous liquors , and keeps various fasts , particularly that of the Ramadan ... '' Lamen Kebe was a slave who used to be a school teacher in Africa . 
12339	2556	COOPER shared information about the texts and teaching methods used in the Islamic schools of COOPER country . 
12340	2556	Abdul Rahman Ibrahim Sori spent 40 years in slavery before SORI returned to Africa to die . 
12341	2556	SORI wrote two autobiographies , and signed a charcoal sketch of SORI by Henry Inman , which was featured on the cover of `` Freedman 's Journal '' and is on display in the Library of Congress . 
12342	2556	Many of the Muslim slaves were encouraged or forced to convert to Christianity . 
12343	2556	Many of the first-generation slaves retained much of MANY Muslim identity , but under the harsh slavery conditions this identity was largely lost to later generations . 
12344	2557	Were the Jews there too ? 
12345	2557	At America 's beginning ? 
12346	2557	I think not . 
12347	2557	I great great great grand maternal ancestors were here long before any Christian European or Middle East Jew or Muslim set foot on this continent . 
12348	2557	If the native Americans had been treated with a fraction of the `` guilt '' induced largess the Jews received after WWII , ANCESTORS would be a part of the American political aristocracy today . 
12349	2557	I have no sympathy for Israel 's `` humanitarian '' behavior today . 
12350	2557	A historian would question if the Israeli conservatives in power today learned anything from the holocaust . 
12351	2557	When the Old Testament wantonly says the Hebrew god mandates every living thing opposed to Jewish settlements be slaughtered\/exterminated : men , women , children , live stock and planted fields suggests to I that MEN religion cares as little for MEN enemies as MEN infamously impose upon MEN Muslim neighbors . 
12352	2557	Therefore , `` Let MEN who are without sin cast the first stone ! '' 
12353	2557	I think ASPECT_HBENDOR_ post is without merit or foundation in ASPECT_HBENDOR_ argument ! 
12354	2558	Obama 's presidency is n't over yet . 
12355	2558	How can ASPECT_FROGGER_ compare OBAMA 2 year term so far with the unmitigated , colossal failure of Bratboy Bush 's 8 years . 
12356	2558	Bush had virtual total control over the country with the Neocon Republicans running the show for BUSH . 
12357	2558	What little power the Dems did to curtail BUSH conservative shenanigans , BUSH made null and void by `` signing statements . '' 
12358	2558	And , to ridicule some of BUSH statements compared with the statements now being broadcast by Fox News -LRB- news ? -RRB- 
12359	2558	, religious conservatives and the teabaggers is loathsome . 
12360	2558	We all say things WE wished WE had not . 
12361	2558	I , too , have problems with some of the things BUSH 's said , but BUSH is n't a saint just because BUSH 's President . 
12362	2558	Michelle Bachman is close to being a standup comedian with some of the stuff that comes out of her mouth along with Huckabee , Gingrich , Santorum , Palin , et al. who aspire to run for President next year . 
12363	2559	So ASPECT_SASSY_ voted for him because ASPECT_SASSY_ did n't think HIM was as bad as the other candidate ? 
12364	2559	People should vote for who is the best , and there should be a list of good enough candidates so that we should n't have to vote for whoever wo n't screw up the country the worst . 
12365	2560	Cool post ! 
12367	2561	Cool Post # 2 ! 
12370	2562	No I disagree , the problem is decades crimes of money and power orientated politicians in both parties . 
12371	2562	POLITICIANS all are evil separated only by degrees of sin . 
12372	2562	I can usually tell when someone is losing by how intense the name calling gets ! 
12373	2562	The liberal democrats must be beyond losing ! 
12374	2562	Ha ha ... Anyway ~ The ` addlebrained tea party ' is going to continue to roll on baby , DEMOCRATS rule , handing the Dems DEMOCRATS ass at every turn it seems . 
12375	2562	I am not a conservative nor a liberal , -LRB- I vote the issues on an individual basis -RRB- just an observer but have watched the tea party be ridiculed by MSNBC -LRB- a crappy liberal news station blown out of the water by a conservative pro bush FOX -RRB- and liberals that come out of the woodwork to -LRB- attempt to -RRB- bash LIBERALS only to be made look like fools as the teaparty steam rolls LIBERALS as easily as squashing a hapless bug . 
12376	2562	In fact LIBERALS roll over anyone that opposes LIBERALS . 
12377	2562	If ASPECT_SASSY_ oppose LIBERALS Sassy , I recommend ASPECT_SASSY_ use something other than rhetoric against LIBERALS , or ASPECT_SASSY_ too will be mauled by the mean political machine called the tea party . 
12379	2564	He 's on course to do that . 
12380	2565	Sorry , with that simplistic POV , a democracy is no better than a dictatorship . 
12381	2565	That 's a fool 's point of view and exactly why the House turned Republican . 
12382	2565	The `` cranky '' Liberals refused to go to the polls because LIBERALS did n't think Obama was `` liberal '' enough so the teabaggers -LRB- LIBERALS are rabid minority -RRB- got TEABAGGERS Neocon vote out . 
12383	2565	What nonsense . 
12384	2565	How childish . 
12385	2565	How typical of Americans to `` pout '' when LIBERALS think -LRB- think ? -RRB- 
12386	2565	LIBERALS have been maltreated by LIBERALS leadership . 
12387	2565	Liberals got the gridlock LIBERALS deserve ; the conservatives got the gridlock CONSERVATIVES deserve and the rest of us have to bite US lip and live with the consequences . 
12388	2565	I deeply resent that perspective . 
12389	2565	Since ASPECT_OLDJAR07_ post suggests that not enough `` good '' candidates are available , pray tell I ASPECT_OLDJAR07_ solution to that dilemma ? 
12390	2565	US have 2 parties in power in this country and because the individual `` states '' determine how a candidate is qualified to run , the most powerful party makes that decision . 
12391	2565	Money is usually the determinate factor . 
12392	2565	Take the money out of ALL politics and that levels the playing field for ALL candidates as well as the voters . 
12394	2565	because candidates are no longer under pressure to `` reward '' those who donate to get the candidate elected . 
12395	2565	Another improvement would be to redistrict the country according to the Constitution , not limit the number to 435 districts ; begin nonpartisan redistricting according to population alone , not by political party ; get rid of the electoral college ; return the office of President and V.P. to be voted on separately so that the candidate with the most votes becomes President and the next highest vote getter becomes V.P. -LRB- this was the way it was historically done just after the Constitution was adopted -RRB- . 
12396	2565	These changes take the `` selection power '' out of party politics and returns that power to the voters where POWER `` should '' be , as ASPECT_OLDJAR07_ idealize . 
12397	2565	That going to happen ? 
12398	2566	The teabaggers are radical . 
12399	2566	Radicals tend to tune into the anger the general population is feeling and gain popularity for a time . 
12400	2566	Egypt is a example . 
12401	2566	The people managed to overthrow the `` hated '' head of state , but after the dust settles , the army remains the only stable organization ; and that 's exactly from where Mubarak rose to power . 
12402	2566	The teabaggers gained power in the southwest and southern Republican party -LRB- democrats until LBJ passed the civil rights act -RRB- ; from religious conservative Democrats -LRB- blue dogs -RRB- in the midwest ; and Fox News who has become a doggerel political party using so called public owned airways . 
12403	2566	Thanks to union buster Ronald Reagan , the once powerful labor unions that literally `` made '' the middle class after WWII have lost PAC power ; and Reagan 's tax aversion to ALL public education initiatives for American children , the quality of educated young people in America has deteriorated dramatically . 
12404	2566	We rank no where near the top 5 % globally WE once did . 
12405	2566	Home schooling is a dismal failure when FAILURE comes to giving children the tools CHILDREN need to `` lead '' the world in trade , finance , invention . 
12406	2566	So , ra , and the rest of the teabag NRA militia , tote ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ guns to political rallies and shoot to wound and kill the opposition representatives ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ hold with vicious contempt and hatred . 
12407	2566	That creates chaos and fear for a time , but eventually , even that becomes intolerable and the majority will out at the voting box . 
12408	2566	So , stick to ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ delusions . 
12409	2566	REPRESENTATIVES will allow ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ to sleep at night . 
12411	2567	He 's trying to lead from the center . 
12412	2567	That means HE offends both those who are strongly liberal and conservative , but CENTER does n't follow that what HE 's doing or has done is wrong . 
12413	2567	When Bush was at this same period in BUSH Presidency , BUSH had moved the USA into 2 wars , one of which after 10 years we now know was based on a blatant lie ; the other BUSH called a `` war '' any reasonable person would say WE ca n't win now or ever . 
12414	2567	Yet , Bush was elected to a 2nd term . 
12415	2567	Based on the above , I 'd suggest that most American voters are gluttons for political punishment . 
12416	2568	Yes it would , , Bush had the Democrats adding a major part in the problem with the housing , Barney even admits IT . 
12417	2568	Obama is screwing up all on OBAMA own . 
12418	2568	ASPECT_MAGNUM_ still have Gitmo and not only has n't Obama gotten out of the war , OBAMA started another . 
12419	2568	The guy is horrible magnum , Oh , and GUY is still talking about infrastructure , will very possibly lose Health care and has the country more divided than ever , and GUY did CARE all in how long ? 
12420	2568	Bush was there eight years . 
12421	2568	The Liberals are so frustrated LIBERALS are causing violence all over , and unemployment is still a major problem . 
12422	2568	I have never seen any President do all this damage in such a short period of time , not even Carter ... Hey , if CARTER takes prisoners in Libya where will CARTER put PRISONERS ? 
12423	2568	OHHHHHHHH NOOOOOOOO ... . 
12424	2569	Obama did n't start this , where are ASPECT_FLOUNDER_ getting ASPECT_FLOUNDER_ information ? 
12426	2570	Ohhhhh yes OHHHHH did . 
12427	2570	We were not in it till OHHHHH said so ... . 
12429	2571	It was supposed to be Italy , Britain , Canada , and us . 
12430	2571	Well , CANADA was basically just US . 
12431	2571	I have no clue what he 'll do next - or wo n't do . 
12432	2571	Hell , Obama is a rogue POTUS . 
12433	2572	Who started it then ? 
12434	2572	We would not be shooting missiles right now unless Obama ordered them ... OBAMA is the commander in chief ASPECT_MAPLELEAFER8_ know . 
12435	2572	If Bush has started this , there would be outrage from the left , the hypocrisy is incredible . 
12436	2573	To be honest CHRISTIAN am a fringe christian -LRB- or open theist christian -RRB- and an activist . 
12437	2573	So CHRISTIAN was not unhappy to see the rise of the tea party and THEM power . 
12438	2573	However , CHRISTIAN know very little about the detailed inner workings of the tea party . 
12439	2573	CHRISTIAN do know MSNBC hates THEM and FOX loves THEM , ha ha that 's a fairly good endorsement as far as CHRISTIAN am concerned ! 
12440	2573	That said CHRISTIAN will also tell ASPECT_SASSY_ CHRISTIAN am no great fan of FOX but CHRISTIAN do SO detest MSNBC ! 
12441	2573	THEM are a violent group masquerading as do gooders when GOODERS are just as mean and hateful as what THEM imagine the awful gun toting right wingers are ! 
12442	2573	Ok why do ASPECT_SASSY_ think the tea party is radical ? 
12443	2573	How radical do ASPECT_SASSY_ think THEM are ? 
12444	2573	Are THEM as radical as say the Taliban who uses murder and terror to accomplish THEM goals ? 
12445	2573	ASPECT_SASSY_ make serious claims so ASPECT_SASSY_ should have serious proof of this violence and that VIOLENCE instigated and approved of by the chairman of the tea party . 
12446	2573	So proof please ? 
12447	2573	And PLUEASE no pictures or u tube videos of questionable origins . 
12448	2573	Nor pictures or rhetoric any renegade so called member . 
12449	2573	CHRISTIAN am taking about war orders from the chairman president or what ever the Tea Party calls their leadership . 
12450	2573	CHRISTIAN have seen exactly NONE ! 
12451	2573	Ha ha what is MSNBC pray tell ? 
12452	2573	CHRISTIAN think that the liberals are simply jealous and fearful that FOX is so popular ! 
12453	2573	LIBERALS are uber terrified that LIBERALS are in the extreme minority . 
12454	2573	LIBERALS do not blame LIBERALS , but rather LIBERALS blame popular talk shows like Rush Borze Savage Beck FOX etc. as being leaders of an right wing conspiracy or something ! 
12455	2573	How stupid is that ? 
12456	2573	Sorry , that the popularity of the right wing is where the advertising money is ! 
12457	2573	If the fringe leftist view was popular FOX would be courting the left ! 
12458	2573	VIEW that easy eh ? 
12459	2573	Again CHRISTIAN am not especially enamored with FOX , EH like every other capitalistic endeavor . 
12460	2573	EH are in business to make money first , sometimes at the expense of the truth , hence the FOXs and the Becks and the Rushes . 
12461	2573	We live in a semi free country and if the majority of the people beleive and want to hear far right talk and are willing to spend money to see TALK then by god that 's whats going to be on TV ! 
12462	2573	COUNTRY far more a money thing than a political thing . 
12463	2573	CHRISTIAN think the leftist liberal airheads are in denial and can not beleive that maybe 80 % of the population are more like FOX viewers than like VIEWERS . 
12464	2573	The only good thing the unions did is raise the wage in the early 1900s . 
12465	2573	The trouble is AIRHEADS did not know where to stop and ended up killing the goose that laid AIRHEADS golden eggs . 
12466	2573	CHRISTIAN am not pro union but not anti union either . 
12467	2573	The guns carried to those rallies appear to CHRISTIAN to be a symbol -LRB- look BIT up BIT may be a bit of a stretch -RRB- . 
12468	2573	If BIT strikes fear in those that know next to nothing about our history or even human nature so be BIT . 
12469	2573	Fear is a good motivator . 
12470	2573	OUR founding fathers knew that firearms were necessary as a fear motivator and as a symbol . 
12471	2573	What do OUR think this means ? 
12472	2573	; `` The constitutions of most of our States assert that all power is inherent in the people ; that ... RIGHT is PEOPLE right and duty to be at all times armed ; ... '' Thomas Jefferson ... `` No Free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms . '' 
12473	2573	A free people -LRB- should be -RRB- to be armed &#8230; '' George Washington ... or `` The people are not to be disarmed of PEOPLE weapons . 
12474	2573	PEOPLE are left in full possession of PEOPLE . '' 
12475	2573	Zachariah Johnson ... `` To disarm the people -LRB- is -RRB- the best and most effectual way to enslave PEOPLE . '' 
12476	2573	&#8230; '' George Mason `` Besides the advantage of being armed , which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation , ... in the several kingdoms of Europe , ... the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms . '' 
12477	2573	James Madison `` Fear is the foundation of most governments ... '' John Adams , Thoughts on Government , 1776 . 
12478	2573	ASPECT_SASSY_ may be in denial Sassy double check Obamas numbers , PEOPLE want ADAMS GONE . 
12479	2573	CHRISTIAN will stick to the laments of CHRISTIAN founding fathers and God . 
12480	2573	Yes CHRISTIAN sleep very well . 
12482	2574	Great posts Trinnity and Founder ! 
12484	2575	AMAZING , CAN ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ IMAGINE IF WE USED THAT LOGIC ON THEM ? 
12485	2575	, , , BUSH DID N'T GET US INTO THE WAR , THEY DID ... Whats funny is we might be able to actually say that , but US do not remember Libya attacking WE , do ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ Rev ? 
12486	2575	Obama is the aggressor , and THEM cant stand INTO . 
12487	2575	Everything THEM ever said about Bush and War just went up in smoke ... PooF \* 
12489	2576	Up in smoke eh ? 
12490	2576	That reminds me of the Cheeze and Chong movie ... Maybe they too -LRB- the USA haters -RRB- are smoking some good stuff , and have been since 1969 !!! 
12492	2577	As is usual , ASPECT_FLOUNDER_ posts are drenched in hatred and , as saintly Ronnie Reagan put it , lugubrious `` disinformation . '' 
12493	2577	Just because ASPECT_FLOUNDER_ say IT , IT must be true . 
12494	2577	ASPECT_FLOUNDER_ current forum name , flounder , is appropriate , because ASPECT_FLOUNDER_ eyes have relocated to only one side of ASPECT_FLOUNDER_ head , and every word ASPECT_FLOUNDER_ post is `` fishy . '' 
12495	2577	The worst presidential administration in history , by far and away , is Neocon Bratboy Bush and BUSH `` troop leader '' Dickyboy Cheney !!!!! 
12496	2577	Hands down !!!!! 
12497	2577	Further , ASPECT_FLOUNDER_ teabag Republicans have been in office 3 months and have n't created a single job . 
12498	2577	Where are all those jobs , by the way ? 
12499	2577	All the `` leaderless '' Republicans can get WAY on with is their `` long in the tooth '' straw man goofball antiAmerican human and economic rights issues : gay marriage , abortion , CUT TAXES FOR RICH PEOPLE , etc. . 
12500	2577	Now THEIR are in full seamy dictator mode -LRB- i.e. Wisconsin and other `` backward '' stumbling , unbalanced teabag states -RRB- to disenfranchise tax paying union folk . 
12501	2577	Now that 's a real bell ringer for the cranial brainless !!!! 
12502	2579	ASPECT_SASSY_ did not answer one charge , , not one . 
12504	2579	I here name calling but nothing about the Housing , Gitmo , War , jobs , , nothing ... and GITMO has been in there how long ? 
12505	2579	After ASPECT_SASSY_ call a few names ASPECT_SASSY_ say , , Further , , , and ask about three months , but nothing about the last couple of years ... ASPECT_SASSY_ talk about cut Tax 's that Obama approved , so I guess OBAMA disappointed ASPECT_SASSY_ again . 
12506	2579	Here is how HERE works , , ASPECT_SASSY_ are supposed to pose a cohesive argument , like why Obama let the rich slide with tax 's , why OBAMA approves of Gitmo , why the Democrats ruined the Housing market ... follow ? 
12507	2580	That confession is the most honest thing I have seen ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ post ! 
12508	2580	If anyone sits at one moment in the front and then in the next moment at back end of the horse , MOMENT 's ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ ! 
12509	2580	Suggests an inability to make sense about what MOMENT is ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ DO believe . 
12510	2580	That 's a fragile , rickety fence ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ sit on . 
12511	2580	What the above post just said is that ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ `` hate '' -LRB- detest -RRB- MSNBC and the people there . 
12512	2580	Now is that the proper spirit for a `` Christian '' to have toward anyone ? 
12513	2580	Oh , I misspoke , ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ just said CHRISTIAN are a `` fringe '' Christian and an activist . 
12514	2580	-LRB- Was n't NOW Jesus who said : Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar 's and unto God that which is God 's -RRB- . 
12515	2580	Just a reminder : But , is n't that exactly the kind of `` righteous '' rhetoric and behavior that is antipathy to devoted Christians ? 
12516	2580	Just sayin ' ? 
12517	2580	OOOOOO , must I must have hit a `` soggy '' spot in ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ teabag . 
12518	2580	I do n't have to prove anything I 've ascribed to the `` teabaggers . '' 
12519	2580	TEABAGGERS do OOOOOO every time one of them opens his\/her mouth either in an op ed or to a reporter . 
12520	2580	In fact , TEABAGGERS spend as much time ` esplainin ' what TEABAGGERS mean as TEABAGGERS do in making the red faced statement TEABAGGERS began with . 
12521	2580	Right wing demagogue M. Bachman is the chairman of the congressional teabag caucus . 
12522	2580	M. best response to a reporter -LRB- MTP a week ago -RRB- is to ignore the question and repeat outrageous statements M. has memorized -- about like RR 's repeating the same speech throughout REPORTER 8 years as President . 
12523	2580	The other teabagger is Baptist preacher , Huckabee . 
12524	2580	CHRISTIAN last public description of Obama as being born and raised in Kenya is undisputed proof that CHRISTIAN 's as intellectually ignorant and as CHRISTIAN is a reprobate Christian -LRB- Thou shall not bear false witness -RRB- . 
12525	2580	Plus , I like the way ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ dictate to I what ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ want I to prove ! 
12526	2580	Jealous of Fox News . 
12528	2580	I them because THEM are so outrageously `` obvious '' that THEM `` choose '' to cater to the lowest common denominator of American voters . 
12529	2580	I ca n't watch 5 minutes of Glen Beck without laughing out loud . 
12530	2580	5 's such a fraud trying to emulate a `` professor '' when 5 has neither the education nor the intellect . 
12531	2580	I 'd love to see 5 go up against someone like Christopher Hitchens who would blow 5 out of the studio both with humor and `` facts ; '' something Beck does n't recognize unless BECK invented THEM . 
12532	2580	What are ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ then ? 
12533	2580	Do ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ know ? 
12534	2580	Seems to I that someone who lives in Appalachia , would be very pro-union because of the inhuman conditions miners endure in the coal mines . 
12535	2580	Or , are ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ an advocate for black lung disease , a preexisting condition that insurance carriers refuse to qualify for treatment ? 
12536	2581	It does n't do any good to answer `` ASPECT_FLOUNDER_ '' charges ! 
12537	2581	ASPECT_FLOUNDER_ response is to dismiss ASPECT_FLOUNDER_ out of hand and then repeat the same over and over again . 
12538	2581	But , that 's what Neocons call debate . 
12540	2582	those 183 fools who want to have Obama get reelected , better wake the hell up and realize that Ron Paul is the ONLY candidate FOOLS should consider voting for in the reelection . 
12541	2582	OBAMA is the ONLY candidate who is for the people , but more importantly , believes in the constitution . 
12542	2582	Here get educated Obama lovers . 
12543	2582	CONSTITUTION takes two hours to watch but ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ have that time . 
12544	2582	ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ take that much time to watch movies all the time . 
12545	2582	Wake up Obama lovers 
12546	2583	Ron Paul is not a candidate . 
12547	2583	At 77 years old , YEARS 's doubtful 77 will be viable . 
12548	2584	I 'd hate to see ASPECT_MNBILLYBOY_ worst . 
12549	2585	Barack Obama is not a candidate . 
12550	2585	At any age , it 's doubtful OBAMA will be a viable . 
12551	2586	Typical liberal voting rationale . 
12552	2586	I heard that McCain was too old by some of I democrat friends , these people could n't list any of Obama 's stances or McCain 's ... SOME claimed it did n't matter because McCain was too old . 
12553	2586	I would rather have an old president who knows what MCCAIN is doing , than an incompetent one . 
12554	2587	And there is historical precident . 
12555	2587	Ronald Reagan was 69 when REAGAN -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- slapped Carter in 1980 . 
12556	2589	Unless the GOP nominee is Bob Inglis , I suspect I choice will be between Obama and the Green party candidate . 
12557	2590	Thanks for the school yard chatter , let us know when ASPECT_SASSY_ care to actually debate . 
12559	2591	PERSON said the same things -LRB- and more -RRB- in PERSON introduction . 
12560	2591	So PERSON do not waver in PERSON values . 
12561	2591	PERSON am the same when PERSON introed ' as PERSON am now , ASPECT_SASSY_ only had to look at PERSON introduction ... No , ASPECT_SASSY_ lied , PERSON never said PERSON hate nor detest the people there . 
12562	2591	That &#8217; s NOT ok ! 
12563	2591	ASPECT_SASSY_ pathetic attempts at character assassination are blatantly obvious , and pathetic . 
12564	2591	Not only that if ASPECT_SASSY_ must lie to get a point across POINT not a point worth making , eh ? 
12565	2591	BTW , in PERSON intro PERSON said this ; &#8220; Hi to all . 
12566	2591	PERSON am a somewhat -LRB- non-traditional -RRB- conservative leaning semi anarchist type person that is suspicious of a overly large and bloated federal government . '' 
12567	2591	So PERSON do not waver in what PERSON say . 
12568	2591	PERSON am a non traditional gun toting -LRB- PERSON carry a .45 with an extended magazine , and a .38 , sometimes PERSON also carry a .12 gauge riot shotgun if PERSON am emptying cash vaults at PERSON machines , usually in the early AM -RRB- . 
12569	2591	Not at all ! 
12570	2591	ASPECT_SASSY_ inaccurate and simple comments are common rhetoric and propaganda used by those that hate Christians and Christianity . 
12571	2591	The personalities of those types of people can be mildly violent to dangerous psychopaths , that are capable of harming others . 
12572	2591	With all due respect , PERSON am not saying ASPECT_SASSY_ are one of those type individuals , but ASPECT_SASSY_ hateful comments about the tea party which is heavily Christian and other conservative groups are nearly identical . 
12573	2591	PERSON am not a tea party person nor member , but maybe ASPECT_SASSY_ can tell PERSON or better yet a moderator what ASPECT_SASSY_ meant by that phrase ie an ` tea bag ? ' 
12574	2591	All talk and no proof . 
12575	2591	Every time ? 
12576	2591	PERSON can claim many things but backing TALK up with proof is not so easy , especially when 90 % of TALK is a lie . 
12577	2591	ASPECT_SASSY_ credibility is zero with PERSON because ASPECT_SASSY_ are fond of making claims without an shred of proof . 
12578	2591	From what PERSON have seen much of the tea party people are normal people , unless the footage is shot by a mike moore or a MSNBC type . 
12579	2591	PERSON backed ASPECT_SASSY_ in a corner because PERSON knew ASPECT_SASSY_ can &#8217; t prove nearly anything ASPECT_SASSY_ say ! 
12580	2591	And PERSON knew ASPECT_SASSY_ would lose CORNER and show ASPECT_SASSY_ true colors -LRB- as in above -RRB- . 
12581	2591	PERSON just wanted everyone else to see the real ASPECT_SASSY_ ! 
12582	2591	In any case ASPECT_SASSY_ rants are always the same prattle as above . 
12583	2591	An hysterical rant by a beaten -LRB- politically -RRB- foe . 
12584	2591	If ASPECT_SASSY_ think the last elections were bad wait until 2012 ! 
12585	2591	Yessssss ASPECT_SASSY_ are ! 
12586	2591	PERSON think morally , as in traditional christian value , FOX viewers are the core of America . 
12587	2591	BUILT are what built America and what will sustain AMERICA when the girlie men run away when the going gets tough . 
12588	2591	So IMO , BUILT are the highest denominator and the best people in America . 
12589	2591	PERSON do n't watch TV news because NEWS mostly entertainment not news . 
12590	2591	PERSON have several computers and a short wave . 
12591	2591	Thats where PERSON get PERSON news . 
12592	2591	Ha ha ~ Name ONE remarkable factual error that beck has made ? 
12593	2591	PERSON am no fan of becks but ~ researches ~ lectres and rarely makes a mistake . 
12594	2591	Ok a challenge # 2 name the facts that Beck has fabricated . 
12595	2591	PERSON am not going to let ASPECT_SASSY_ run from these two challenges . 
12596	2591	-LRB- ha ha this will be so much fun ! -RRB- 
12598	2591	What am PERSON ? 
12599	2591	A child of God . 
12600	2591	PERSON own two christian non profit humanitarian missions and a church -LRB- a paper tiger church to support the missions -RRB- PERSON recently bought a small vending business ... ummm ' PERSON hold a MA in comparative Christianity and a BA in general liberal arts -LRB- gasp PERSON 'm sure -RRB- . 
12601	2591	PERSON am an artist and a photographer , as well as been around the world a couple of times , once with Uncle Sam , all these claims can be vindicated . 
12602	2591	What are ASPECT_SASSY_ ? 
12603	2591	ASPECT_SASSY_ like myths eh ? 
12604	2591	Oh yes another thing , OH ai n't clips OH MAGAZINES . 
12605	2591	Maybe one day ASPECT_SASSY_ will learn that GUYS , the gun lovers , firearm friends , NRA Howdy Doodie guys -LRB- well PERSON basset Bogie is a hoday doe dog -RRB- , real Americans as Archie bunker would say , won in the last SCOTUS decision , DAY 's BROTHERS the PEOPLE , not the militia , not the army but PERSON and PERSON brothers and sisters that have the RIGHT to keep and bear arms . 
12606	2591	And there is not one -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- thing ASPECT_SASSY_ nor ASPECT_SASSY_ hysterical friends can do about ONE . 
12607	2591	Say would ASPECT_SASSY_ consider going out with PERSON ? 
12608	2591	Budda budda byeeee ! 
12610	2592	I have rebutted every issue ASPECT_CHALLENGE_#2_ raised in I post . 
12611	2592	In addition I asked ASPECT_CHALLENGE_#2_ to respond to a couple of challenges . 
12612	2592	Here is I direct quote ; AND ~ I know back when I was asked the same questions I could not meet the challenge . 
12613	2592	Yes I found some minor stuff but not any significant factual errors or fabricated material . 
12614	2592	Frankly I do not know that the outcome will be . 
12615	2592	I do not think Beck will lie . 
12619	2596	I think that Palin is an opportunistic bimbo . 
12620	2596	But I KNOW that the obamalama is a worse president than Nixon , Carter and Bush . 
12621	2596	-LRB- combined or separately -RRB- Therefore I have no worry that Palin could possibly be worse than the incompetent clown obamalama . 
12622	2596	I would hate to see OBAMALAMA elected , but would much rather ELECTED than PALIN . 
12623	2596	obamalama is the worst president in modern times , maybe the worst EVER . 
12624	2596	Each day I get more of a feeling that ANYONE else has an excellent chance of being better . 
12625	2596	Look at what the idiot clown has done while holding reelection foremost in CLOWN plans . 
12626	2596	Reelection is CLOWN only restraint and yet CLOWN has blown over $ 4 trillion dollars in 2 years . 
12627	2596	CLOWN will surpass Bush 's total debt increase IN THIS FISCAL YEAR !!!! 
12629	2596	Less than 3 years compared to 8 years . 
12630	2596	It is beyond scary what 8 will attempt to do if reelected and is a lame duck with no more campaigning to do and no higher office to seek . 
12632	2597	Nixon was a far , far better president than the other clowns ASPECT_DAN40_ mentioned , do not put PRESIDENT in that group !!!!!!!!!!!! 
12633	2599	Despite his protestations to the contrary , Nixon was a crook ! 
12634	2599	And being far better than the previous mentioned group does NOT make HIS in any way acceptable . 
12635	2599	Bad is bad , even if the rest were worse . 
12636	2599	BAD like today 's liberals , when faced with the FACT that obamalama is terrible , LIBERALS want to ignore BAD and point out how bad Bush was . 
12637	2599	Nixon was bad , Bush was worse . 
12638	2599	Both are now history . 
12639	2599	obamalama will be remembered in history as much worse than all the rest . 
12640	2599	That does n't make the rest any better . 
12641	2599	Clinton was a boozing whore monger , and the best we 've had in recent times . 
12642	2599	-LRB- and I 'm NOT a Democrat or in any way liberal -RRB- A sad commentary indeed . 
12643	2599	If obamalama is reelected and no longer has to worry about ANY reelection , , , , , , , , , , , , , , THE WORST IS YET TO COME ! 
12644	2600	Absolutely not . 
12645	2600	If the GOP does n't put up anyone good I will find an independent that I can vote for . 
12646	2601	I agree . 
12647	2601	I wonder do ASPECT_DAN40_ think any president can not be a crook ? 
12648	2601	I beleive that we should revamp WE political system . 
12649	2601	WE have an electoral college that nearly no common man understands . 
12650	2601	WE have a system that a presidential candidate must ally CANDIDATE with big money and after that keep the funds flowing by under the table deals . 
12651	2601	That is not a good system ! 
12652	2601	SYSTEM puts the president in bed with people that have goals that are diametrically opposed to the welfare of the people . 
12654	2602	Hey brother Flounder , I dig ASPECT_FLOUNDER_ new avatar ! 
12656	2603	Indeed he has projected the USA as a weak butt kissing nation that 's afraid to use USA power . 
12657	2603	This is good for liberal PC groupies but horrible for the real world plight of the USA . 
12658	2603	The radical Islamic power brokers do not respect weakness and only understand getting a nose bleed from a hard right hook , and not be in doubt that a left to the button is on LEFT way . 
12659	2603	Obama seems to want to destroy this country and the way of life of COUNTRY citizens . 
12660	2603	COUNTRY time to get rid of that weak buffoon . 
12662	2604	Hi Rev , how ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ been , , , LOL , , , thanx , HI is left over from April fools day , , , hahahaha . 
12663	2604	My daughter is all upset , DAUGHTER lost another friend , , DAUGHTER was 23 , Cancer started in DAUGHTER kidneys , very sad ... About 6 years ago DAUGHTER lost DAUGHTER first friend due to a bicycle accident , DAUGHTER wanted to tattoo FRIEND name on DAUGHTER . 
12664	2604	MY said Honey MY understand , but in this life if ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ do that every time ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ lose a friend ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ will look like a phone book ... DAUGHTER listened and held off , to date DAUGHTER has lost four friends . 
12665	2604	MY will call DAUGHTER again later today , DAUGHTER graduates in June ... MY lost several friends this year alone , all were under 60 , , , imagine ? 
12666	2604	MY am glad MY retired early ... MY 'm 62 , , but feel 40 ... MY 'm in great shape MY have a lot to be thankful for . 
12667	2604	MY thought MY would miss MY best friend Mithch more than MY do , but 62 's not like FRIEND is gone , , we speak every night before bed , FRIEND always wants to know whats going on , but MY tell MY FRIEND best start picking up FRIEND end of the conversation the S.O.B. ... . 
12668	2605	One of my best friends is a practicing Muslim , I have known MUSLIM and MUSLIM family for over twenty years . 
12669	2605	MUSLIM told I our President is a fool , MUSLIM does not understand just how crazy those people are . 
12670	2605	The Muslims here want nothing to do with PEOPLE , in fact that 's why many are here , as OUR have realized MUSLIM said these people are living a thousand years ago , and will never change . 
12671	2605	All PEOPLE understand is blood , FACT 's who PEOPLE are . 
12672	2605	MUSLIM also mentioned that Obama thinks OBAMA can deal with PEOPLE , MUSLIM 's a fool MUSLIM said ... '' ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ can never trust anything that comes out of PEOPLE mouth , all PEOPLE have is PEOPLE crazy mixed up beliefs , and PEOPLE will never make a honest deal with anybody . '' 
12673	2605	MUSLIM hates Obama , like ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ OBAMA feels OBAMA is making this country weak and that OBAMA should stop the BS and kill every one of them , WAY 's the only way . 
12674	2605	I would trust I friend Adam with I life , ADAM is a very good man . 
12675	2605	I asked ADAM why dont the Muslims here speak up more . 
12676	2605	ADAM said to ADAM '' Dave , ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ are not understanding I , we want nothing to do with THEM , nothing . 
12677	2605	These are not Muslims to WE , PEOPLE are crazy people , do ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ look at that nut who burned that Koran as one of ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ ? 
12678	2605	, of course ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ dont , to ASPECT_REVANARCHIST_ OF is a maniac , , , same thing . 
12679	2605	Only with WE there are many of PEOPLE , many more than people think , WE ignore what PEOPLE do , PEOPLE are not Muslims , why would WE want to give PEOPLE any concern ? 
12680	2605	I hate every one of those Bastards Dave , WE all do '' 
12681	2606	Hee hee ... It looks like a friend of mine ! 
12682	2606	Oh I am well ! 
12683	2606	That is quite a lot for someone in their twenties . 
12684	2606	Maybe LOT will prepare her for other losses . 
12685	2606	And in a way WAY a gain if HER and HER friends are christian . 
12686	2606	I consider WAY a promotion of sorts . 
12687	2606	While that sounds a bit callous WAY beautiful if ASPECT_FLOUNDER_ think about WAY ! 
12688	2606	Ha ha Well I am over fifty and feel a hundred and fifty ! 
12689	2606	I have a lot of metal and plastic , coral , and cadaver parts -LRB- bone -RRB- that need replacing ! 
12690	2606	I have lost so many people that I knew that I have stopped counting ! 
12691	2606	I grew up in the drug culture and back then ASPECT_FLOUNDER_ were weird if ASPECT_FLOUNDER_ did not use some kind of substance , and SHOWING showing by most of the people I knew dying of strange diseases before PEOPLE hit 60 ! 
12692	2606	I smoke a little dope and drank a lot of booze but never did like the hard stuff , however I Harley Davidson and Army ranger training -LRB- I made STUFF to I first static jump and blew out both I knees because I chute did not open properly -RRB- . 
12693	2606	I finished I stint as a PsyOps specialist , heck STINT fit I personality better than jumping out of airplanes while people shot at ASPECT_FLOUNDER_ ! 
12694	2606	I still ride harleys tho ' ... I know what ASPECT_FLOUNDER_ mean by those one sided convos ! 
12695	2606	God bless ASPECT_FLOUNDER_ brother and sorry to the forum for this off topic convo ... Hey on topic I last wife died by a stroke at age 40 three years ago , HEY did not like Obama and I smile every time I write something nasty about OBAMA ! 
12697	2607	I sure dig Dave ! 
12698	2607	Ha ha yes I feel saddened for those Muslims that are brainwashed into hating us . 
12699	2607	But feeling sorry for them and turning I back on THEM -LRB- the radicals -RRB- is two different things , I sure wish Obama would learn that ! 
12700	2607	Take care bro , I have been up all night , time for a bit of shut eye eh ? 
12702	2609	Better to keep ASPECT_DAN40_ mouth shut and appear stupid , rather than open MOUTH and remove all doubt . 
12703	2612	They must be creating multiple accounts since THEY know THEY are getting beaten in debate and failing on the rep board . 
12704	2614	Politifact is a left leaning site . 
12705	2614	POLITIFACT is NOT unbiased . 
12706	2614	ASPECT_TOMTEAPACK_ may look at POLITIFACT however ASPECT_TOMTEAPACK_ wish , I see them saying odrama has kept only 139 of 508 promises after 30 months . 
12707	2616	It may say he has only kept 139 , but how many does 139 say HE has violated ? 
12708	2616	How many has HE gone totally against ? 
12709	2616	hmm , NONE !!!! 
12710	2616	A President has no magic wand , many of the things they promise are subject to the whims of congress , and boy does WAND have whims . 
12711	2616	ASPECT_DAN40_ may not like the many things obama has done , ASPECT_DAN40_ may disagree with OBAMA promises , ASPECT_DAN40_ may disagree with OBAMA politics , but to say OBAMA has NOT kept promises and has broken any is a flat out lie . 
12712	2616	Personally CENTRIST agree with about 50 percent of the things OBAMA has done , which happens to be about 48 percent more than the things McCain\/Palin promised . 
12713	2616	CENTRIST am a Centrist , not a leftist , or rightest 
12714	2617	Do ASPECT_TOMTEAPACK_ not read and comprehend well ? 
12715	2617	Are ASPECT_TOMTEAPACK_ ideologically blinded by nonsense . 
12716	2617	The left leaning site clearly says odrama has BROKEN 42 promises and `` compromised '' -LRB- code for broken -RRB- 41 others . 
12717	2617	And 42 with or without the 41 added ` compromises ' is just a bit more than NONE !! 
12718	2618	President Obama has , in large part , based OBAMA administration policy on George W Bush . 
12719	2618	To think OBAMA campaigned against OBAMA makes that all the harder to swallow . 
12720	2618	The President had opportunities to change course , but squandered POLICY . 
12721	2621	WOW , , , , , look at the chart below , and then look at the results of the poll above ... When ASPECT_YIDNAR_ look at the conservative and moderate number NUMBER pretty much tells ASPECT_YIDNAR_ what the independents will do ... and Liberals , , , , , the same old mistake ... LOL 
12722	2622	this looks like a republican view in disguisePresident Obama must be re-elected because OBAMA is the opposite of Bush and wants to redistribute wealth from the rich corrupt free market place into the hands of the middle class citizens . 
12723	2623	And that 's exactly why THAT wont be elected again ... THAT is Un-American ! 
12724	2623	THAT will not only Lose , but there will be a landslide against this man and MAN ideas . 
12725	2624	not all libs are commies but all commies are libberal 
12726	2625	ASPECT_YIDNAR_ first . 
12727	2626	Say what ? 
12728	2626	Do ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ understand the difference between the middle class and the working class ? 
12729	2627	How the hell is a fact biased ... are they making up `` facts '' ? 
12732	2627	. would be nice for ASPECT_DAN40_ to show where politifact shows bias . 
12734	2627	the only way they could do that is to outright lie right ? 
12735	2627	From what I have seen THEY accept fact checking requests about any politician and rate WAY for truth . 
12736	2628	GOP 'm not a GOP or DNC . 
12737	2628	President Obama has expanded and extended Bush era policies . 
12739	2628	GOP hate to break PERIOD to ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ , but as bad of a President as Obama is , PRESIDENT is n't a socialist . 
12740	2628	President Obama is a Corporatist . 
12741	2629	some corporations need to be rewarded because CORPORATIONS are good and behind our plan like GM , the bad corporations however are the ones that need to pay more in taxes because CORPORATIONS are operating immorally and against the interests of the middle class like the oil companies . 
12742	2629	President Obama should be re-elected because OBAMA is the opposite of Bush and backs the good corporations unlike Bush who backed the oil companies which led to wars for oil and a recession . 
12743	2632	Spoken like a true liberal drone . 
12744	2632	Obama has no problem taking campaign money from these corporations , millionaires and billionaires that OBAMA rewards . 
12745	2632	Hopefully , if enough Americans wake up from CORPORATIONS Obama zombie slumber , Obama will be but a distant memory in 2012 . 
12746	2633	Troops out of Afghanistan immediately ? 
12747	2633	Did n't happenClosing of Gitmo ? 
12748	2633	Did n't happenRepeal of Patriot Act ? 
12749	2633	Did n't happenGov ' t tranparency ? 
12750	2633	Yeah right . 
12751	2633	Bi partisanship ? 
12752	2633	Not in the least . 
12753	2636	LOL , no he does n't . 
12754	2636	Obama is a right-wing neoliberal . 
12755	2636	OBAMA was installed into power to serve Wall Street and corporate interests , and OBAMA has not let them down . 
12756	2636	The middle class has no future in the neoliberal worldview of Barack Obama . 
12757	2638	odrama decides to golf , play basketball , or go on another vacation . 
12758	2638	Everything else he avoids deciding anything . 
12759	2638	HE gives that to Reid , Pelosi , Geithner , or Bernake to decide whatever they want . 
12760	2638	And of course , HE does decide to blame everyone else but HE . 
12761	2638	And ASPECT_TOMTEAPACK_ 're right HE does hate the Constitution and HE is firmly against FREEDOM in any form . 
12762	2638	And HE is also firmly against `` merit . '' 
12763	2639	That reasoning does n't hold water . 
12764	2639	The President 's primary job is to uphold and defend the US Constitution . 
12765	2639	Listen to the oath of office sometime , look OATH up , do a little research before ASPECT_TOMTEAPACK_ post comments on the internet . 
12766	2639	President Obama is as bad a President as G W Bush . 
12767	2639	Both parties hated PRESIDENT also , PRESIDENT was n't a Constitutionalist , PRESIDENT was a centralist , PRESIDENT is a neoconservative , like Obama . 
12768	2639	ASPECT_TOMTEAPACK_ really need to open ASPECT_TOMTEAPACK_ eyes . 
12769	2639	The politicians have ASPECT_TOMTEAPACK_ fooled . 
12770	2641	would have to disagree , no political candidate can be against the interests of all corporations because that is where the money is ... also populist is subjective since the US has a big conservative christian base who finds homosexual rights , stem cell research , abortions , etc. . 
12772	2641	all to be immoral . 
12773	2641	americans should vote for President Obama because OBAMA picks the good corporations as winners and makes the bad corporations into losers by paying more taxes for socialist initiatives , this is seen in the domestic drilling ban for the bad oil corporations and the tax breaks for the good corporations like GE for investing in clean energy ... a republican candidate would allow the oil companies to drill for oil causing wars and pollution and not redistribute wealth from the rich and bad corporations to the middle class , President Obama is a hybrid of socialist and corporatist and that is better than a republican who is a capitalist and corporatist . 
12774	2642	Uh , right , more like the fact that Jeffrey Immelt , CEO of GE , is one of Obama 's top campaign contributors . 
12775	2642	The man whom Obama appointed to the President 's Economic Recovery Advisory Board , and to serve as chairman of the Council on Jobs and Competitiveness , while GE pays no taxes on GE massive profits . 
12776	2642	Obama is doing everything ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ say `` a republican candidate '' would do . 
12777	2642	It is Obama who has been pushing for more drilling in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico . 
12778	2642	It is Obama who has launched illegal wars in Libya , Yemen , and Pakistan , while escalating Afghanistan and lying about ever withdrawing from Iraq . 
12779	2642	It is Obama who has pushed hard to protect tax breaks for the rich , and has been obsessed since the day RICH got into office with cutting Social Security and Medicare . 
12780	2642	Obama has not a single socialist impulse . 
12781	2642	OBAMA is a hardcore right-wing neoliberal capitalist whose idol is Ronald Reagan . 
12782	2643	ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ make a good point in highlighting that populism can be subjective ... however , I think ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ know what I really meant by the use of the term : I was referring to one being a standard leftist populist , not a rightist populist -LRB- like the Tea Party movement -RRB- . 
12783	2643	ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ are also correct to point out that not all commercial interests are equally hostile to the broader public interest . 
12784	2643	But still , I was going beyond that . 
12785	2643	I was saying that POPULIST is not only supported by liberal capitalists , but also has genuine loyalties to the ordinary population . 
12786	2643	-LRB- i.e. . 
12787	2643	That POPULIST is at least a part-time populist . -RRB- 
12788	2643	POPULIST is n't a slam dunk on either side of that equation . 
12789	2643	POPULIST can be pressured into leaning toward either side . 
12790	2643	POPULIST of course was n't trying to say that Obama is `` against the interests of all corporations '' . 
12791	2643	Frankly , I have no idea how ASPECT_LIBERALMINORITY_ got that that interpretation of I post . 
12792	2643	I just meant that POPULIST is not strictly , or even necessarily principally , beholden to commercial interests of any sort . 
12793	2644	Me too , unless Ron Paul gets the GOP nom . 
12794	2645	anybody who votes for any other candidate other than ron paul is a fool especially the 192 people that have said they will vote for obama again . 
12795	2645	guess PEOPLE must all be black people . 
12796	2645	Many blacks dont sem to care that PAUL has continued everything Bush got started and lied about everything BUSH said BUSH was going to do and has expanded and accelerated the recession . 
12797	2645	Guess all those 192 Obama lovers love GUESS that OBAMA is taking us down towards nazi germany same as Bush , Clinton , congress and all those other candidates that do not believe in the constitution . 
12798	2646	That 's the question that popped into my head vis - - vis ASPECT_POLLY_MINX_ when MY read that bizarre claim that Wall Street 's man Obama is some kind of `` populist '' . 
12799	2646	Obama 's economic policies are the same as Bush 's . 
12800	2646	`` Stimulus packages '' which are smoke and mirrors , consisting largely of kickbacks and `` tax cuts '' which do n't produce a single job . 
12801	2646	Obama has done nothing to address any fundamental problems with the U.S. economy . 
12802	2646	OBAMA did not re-instate any serious financial regulation , like the Glass-Steagall Act , which was repealed under the last right-wing Democratic president . 
12803	2646	OBAMA has done nothing to address any of the flawed `` free trade '' agreements which have driven out jobs and lowered standards ... also signed by Clinton . 
12804	2646	Rather OBAMA is instead pushing for new ones like KORUS , so American jobs can now be sent to North Korea too . 
12805	2646	OBAMA has done nothing to address the soaring costs of healthcare weighing on America 's economy , taking single-payer off the table before the whole fake `` debate '' over OBAMA DoleRomneyCare bill even began . 
12806	2646	Obama has accepted the Tea Party consensus that there is a `` debt crisis '' going on , and that programs like Medicare and Social Security are to blame for SECURITY . 
12807	2646	OBAMA has accepted the idea that we need massive spending cuts even though WE are in the middle of a depression and unemployment is already soaring . 
12808	2646	Meanwhile OBAMA has repeatedly made `` deals '' violating OBAMA own promise to even let the Bush tax cuts expire , never mind the idea of actually making serious reforms to the tax code so the rich might pay their fair share . 
12809	2646	On the whole , Obama does n't really represent any major shifts from the neoliberal economic policies that have characterized the past 30 years . 
12810	2646	If anything , OBAMA is more effective than Reagan and Bush at actually getting once-sacrosanct Democratic programs like Social Security onto the chopping block . 
12811	2646	Obama is black . 
12812	2646	Neither occupation will be ending , Polly . 
12813	2646	Obama has doubled the number of troops in Afghanistan . 
12814	2646	We do n't even know how many thousands of private contractors are on the ground in Iraq . 
12815	2646	Never mind a pacifist , MY do n't see how anyone with a moral compass could possibly find anything to be happy about with the current warmonger-in-chief 's policies . 
12816	2646	Obama has doubled down on Bush 's radical neocon `` war on terror '' policies , both foreign and domestic . 
12817	2646	Well , MY was n't getting into the specifics of Obama 's illegal war on Libya . 
12818	2646	MY was simply making reference to Obama 's overall continuation of neoconservative foreign policy , just as OBAMA has continued neoliberal economic policy . 
12819	2648	yeah the 192 fools that said they would vote for him again need to look at this video . 
12820	2648	FOOLS wont of course since FOOLS are so much in denial . 
12821	2649	I would vote for Ron Paul . 
12822	2652	Maybe they 'll nominate the Wicked Witch of the West Pelosi !! 
12823	2652	Actually for all WITCH dumpiness , Hillary with Bill in WITCH corner would be the best Democrat candidate . 
12824	2652	b.o. is starting to smell bad to the DnC , Sorry , DNC . 
12825	2655	Bush is already out of office . 
12826	2655	Can BUSH be impeached after BUSH 's already left office ? 
12827	2656	Half of these are just flat out lies ... At least he does n't say giving Snooki and Charlie Sheen tax cuts will create jobs ... 
12828	2658	HE has not kept most of HE campaign promises . 
12829	2658	HE has not been transparent . 
12830	2658	HE has\/will raise taxes on everyone -LRB- no tax cut for 95 % of Americans -RRB- . 
12831	2658	HE has increased spending\/size of government to record levels . 
12832	2658	He has \/ will increase our deficit to record levels . 
12833	2658	HE ignores The People and pushes through legislation any way HE can . 
12834	2658	HE has weakened national security\/border security . 
12835	2658	HE has several proposed policies that will hurt Americans and OUR economy . 
12836	2658	HE is shunning OUR allies and kissing the asses of OUR enemies . 
12837	2658	HE continues to spew lies and BS to the American people . 
12838	2658	Every one of the above is trueHe has kept less than 200 of over 500 promises . 
12839	2658	That is not saying HE has broken the rest , just has not kept PEOPLE . 
12840	2658	Even liberals could not possibly claim there has been ANYTHING transparent about odrama 's back room deals . 
12841	2658	ODRAMA has VOWED that the tax cuts will expire in Dec 2012 . 
12842	2658	That will increase the taxes on the rich by $ 70 billion and increase the taxes on everyone else by $ 300 billion per year . 
12843	2658	ODRAMA already has increased spending and government size and deficits to record levels . 
12844	2658	ODRAMA has never had a deficit below $ 1,293.5 TRILLION . 
12845	2658	No other president EVER had a deficit as high as $ 500 billion . 
12846	2658	EVER pushed obamacare through with threats and bribes to EVER own party and when passed and still today , the majority of the American People are against obamacare . 
12847	2658	Selling automatic weapons to criminals across our border is NOT the way to increase border security . 
12848	2658	EVER Stimulus bill cost the nation a TRILLION dollars OUR do n't have . 
12849	2658	And today OUR unemployment rate is higher than when the bill was passed which means by simple arithmetic , that there are fewer jobs now than when the bill was passed . 
12850	2658	Regardless of EVER lying claims . 
12851	2658	And the last two are obvious to anyone alive . 
12852	2658	And resisting tax increases that would not solve any problem -LRB- raising a mere $ 70 billion per year , MAYBE -RRB- and might cause more problems , is NOT asking for tax cuts for Snooki and Charlie Sheen . 
12853	2658	One other point about tax breaks . 
12854	2658	odrama is currently harping about special tax breaks for `` corporate jets . '' 
12855	2658	Do ASPECT_EDDYISHERE_ know where those special tax breaks came from ??? 
12856	2658	odrama 's Stimulus bill , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Did ASPECT_EDDYISHERE_ know that the debt commission that odrama formed , that ODRAMA hand-picked , to study ways to reduce our deficits and debt , RECOMMENDED that tax rates be LOWERED ? 
12857	2658	Think that might be why odrama IGNORED their report after THEIR gave REPORT to ODRAMA last Dec. ? 
12858	2659	I will have to vote for Obama , anyone that ALL the parties are mad at , must be doing something right . 
12859	2663	Better to chance an absolute unknown than allow odrama the destroyer of the American Dream any more time to wreak his havoc . 
12860	2663	Palin 's a complete ass and she 'd be leagues better than odrama . 
12861	2663	Pawlenty would be better , Paul would be better , Cain would be better , The squirrel chattering in my back yard would be better . 
12862	2663	Hillary would be better . 
12863	2663	Gulp , Kerry would be better . 
12864	2663	Gore might not be any worse . 
12865	2663	Pelosi and Reid would be as bad or worse . 
12866	2666	-LRB- quote -RRB- No two ways about TWO the guy is out . 
12867	2666	QUOTE 's really amazing this guy was pegged quickly as weak , indecissive , too Liberal , a spender , Liar , and a tremendous bag of wind . 
12868	2666	So much so GUY own party is turning on GUY , even GUY famous speech 's have lost their zip and MUCH shows . 
12869	2666	GUY seems to be just going through the motions , GUY knows MUCH 's over . 
12870	2666	Just the idea this guy will be walking around as a ex President sickens me , GUY is even losing the young vote , , , Man ASPECT_BIRDDOG_ got to go some to lose EX ... hahahahah . 
12871	2666	GUY actually took the hole we were in and dug WE much deeper , and divided people worse than ever . 
12872	2666	Bet ASPECT_BIRDDOG_ anything PEOPLE will be kind to GUY after though , the old PC will kick in and GUY will wind up tenth or something in a list od Presidents . 
12873	2666	Just think , , PEOPLE gave this idiot the Nobel Peace prize ... LOL , , what an absolute Joke . 
12874	2666	Looks good dont PRIZE ... '' Nobel Peace Prize President loses in landslide , , one term President '' LOL , , Labled worse ever , , tagged ... '' The DOWN GRADE President '' 
12875	2668	we are in agreement President Obama is not exclusive to corporate interests , OBAMA takes care of the middle class as well . 
12876	2669	What unknown ? 
12877	2669	We all know the candidates and the even more appaling solution CANDIDATES have for the problems . 
12878	2669	That is the problem CANDIDATES want to tackle , something like the debt limit wasnt even important enough for CANDIDATES shows CANDIDATES are completly incompetent for anything beyond macdonalds . 
12879	2669	BS WASNT idea would have driven USA of a cliff . 
12880	2669	WASNT thinks a default `` isnt a big deal '' Pawlenty cant even take a stand a year and a half before the elections , ron pauls idea are very extreme and unworkable cain talks about not wanting any muslims on PAWLENTY staff and even tough PAWLENTY was a ceo seems to have even less economy knowledge then palin . 
12881	2669	Hilary was my choice last time so yes HILARY was proably better , kerry doubt CHOICE . 
12882	2670	Hi Rev. ... I was having computer problems , all better now though . 
12883	2670	I missed a lot of messages along the way ... 
12884	2671	And the rest are twisted nonsense . 
12885	2672	Please , explain to me a few things \* Obama \* has done to help out the middle class ... and no , raising the unemployment rate does n't count ... and no extending unemployment compensation does not work either . 
12886	2673	If ASPECT_JTHORP24_ are one of the 10 million unemployed by the great recession , ASPECT_JTHORP24_ are getting some help with unemployment because of Obama . 
12887	2673	If ONE were up to our Republican friends , there asses would be in the streets . 
12888	2674	No , Obama cares exclusively about corporate interests . 
12889	2674	The middle class is being wiped out under Obama 's watch . 
12890	2675	Do none of the whining liberals NOT KNOW that the former employers are SUPPLIERS major suppliers of unemployment benefits ? 
12891	2675	Not the clown fool idiot odrama ? 
12892	2675	Employers MUST pay premiums for State unemployment insurance and Federal unemployment insurance . 
12893	2675	The employers build up a bank of unemployment funds . 
12894	2675	When SUPPLIERS lay some one off that fund is where the State gets the money for the unemployment check the person receives . 
12895	2675	And as an employers fund is drawn down , PERSON payments to replenish PERSON ` bank ' go UP . 
12896	2675	And those premiums go up permanently . 
12897	2675	Same is true of `` WORKMAN 'S COMPENSATION , '' benefits . 
12898	2675	The employer MUST pay into WC insurance . 
12899	2675	And the greater the risk for the industry , the higher the insurance costs are . 
12900	2675	Roofing companies for instance pay very high premiums per worker . 
12901	2675	So it is the employer , that is constantly threatened with higher taxes by liberals , that supplies the bulk of the money that politicians take credit for . 
12902	2675	And that money is not counted as a `` TAX ! '' 
12903	2676	odrama 's ` solution ' was a larger debt with nothing to show for SOLUTION . 
12904	2676	ODRAMA failed solution has had 2.5 years to show results . 
12905	2676	SOLUTION failed . 
12906	2676	ASPECT_K995_ may not like other candidates solutions , but trying something new is much better than to keep doing was has failed . 
12907	2676	That is simply insanity . 
12908	2676	And no one has proposed any solution that ASPECT_K995_ could claim is worse than total and utter failure . 
12909	2676	And that IS what the clown fool idiot 's policies have been , failure . 
12910	2676	I 'd prefer to be wrong , but ASPECT_K995_ 're the one that IS wrong but ASPECT_K995_ just demagogue out of blind ideology . 
12911	2676	That is a big a danger to this nation as any outside source . 
12912	2677	Well actually they would be at least looking for a job , many of THEY would have to take a slightly lower paying job . 
12913	2677	JOB 's amazing how quickly these people can find a job once PEOPLE unemployment benefits run out . 
12914	2679	Halted the worst recession in a century , brought down unemployment and is cleaning up the mess left og years of republican president . 
12915	2679	And what `` new '' will they try ? 
12916	2679	None of THEY has any credible idee how to solve the problems . 
12917	2680	unless someone new is born into the Republican party , they do not have a chance of wining the presidential election in 2012 . 
12918	2681	Obama may not get many votes , but the ` Publican candidate will get even less . 
12919	2682	Do n't be absurd , CHA , he is just right of ASPECT_COME_HOME_AMERICA_ . 
12920	2682	There are few true Libertarians in America , and even fewer true Socialists . 
12921	2682	The Fascists have won the day . 
12922	2682	SOCIALISTS are so commonplace SOCIALISTS call SOCIALISTS moderates ; SOCIALISTS are the bulk of the Democratic and Republican parties . 
12923	2682	Obama is a Fascist , exactly as was Bush . 
12924	2684	Whoever wins the hot dog eating contest : 
12925	2686	I 'm glad AMERICAN 're not an American either . 
12926	2686	One less Obama vote . 
12927	2686	`` TEA Baggers and in OBAMA humble opinion BAGGERS are nothing but racist , anti-Muslim , screwballs `` There is no evidence . 
12928	2686	ASPECT_YUKON_ opinion is unfounded . 
12929	2688	Say what ? 
12930	2688	No evidence ? 
12931	2688	Where the h \*\*\* have ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ been living ? 
12932	2688	Get ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ head out of ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ rectum . 
12933	2689	Well , where is the racist evidence of the Tea Party ? 
12934	2690	Check out pictures\/videos of TEA Bagger rallies . 
12935	2690	How many negros do ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ see , how many chinamen , pakistanis , etc etc ? 
12936	2690	Just beacuse NEGROS dont lynch the odd Negro doesnt mean NEGROS arent racists . 
12937	2690	ASPECT_ONALANDLINE_ dont need to see black guys hanging from trees to think theTEA Baggers are racist . 
12938	2691	Most of the stupid pictures are people who were planted for news stories ... the left has already been caught doing that numerous times . 
12939	2691	How many blacks vote republican anyways ? 
12940	2691	Did n't 95 % of blacks vote for Obama ? 
12941	2691	PEOPLE are pretty much a block vote . 
12942	2691	But , please show us some evidence . 
12943	2691	Explain to US how wanting liberty , low taxes , and small government equates to being racist . 
12944	2692	Gallup poll :08 \/ 17\/2011 , BHO approval rating on issues,Best,TERRORISMREPUBLICANS-36 % , INDEPENDENTS-48 % , DEMOCRATS-81 % Worst , CREATING JOBSREPUBLICANS-10 % , INDEPENDENTS-24 % , DEMOCRATS-60 % THE ECONOMY R -- 5 % I -- 23 % , D-53 % BUDGET DEFICIT R -- 5 % , I -- 19 % , D -- 52 %

12958	2695	not a thing from ASPECT_LIBHATER_ posts

12963	2697	I 'm extremely conservative . 
12964	2697	ASPECT_SIGNCUTTER_ are welcome to marry whomever ASPECT_SIGNCUTTER_ wish . 
12965	2697	ASPECT_SIGNCUTTER_ can consume any drugs ASPECT_SIGNCUTTER_ wish , just do n't ask I to pay for ASPECT_SIGNCUTTER_ rehabS . 
12966	2697	ASPECT_SIGNCUTTER_ can sleep with whomever ASPECT_SIGNCUTTER_ wish , except I pets . 
12967	2697	ASPECT_SIGNCUTTER_ may practice any religion that makes ASPECT_SIGNCUTTER_ happy . 
12968	2697	But what ASPECT_SIGNCUTTER_ MAY NOT do is make ASPECT_SIGNCUTTER_ personal business , MY BUSINESS . 
12969	2697	Do whatever ASPECT_SIGNCUTTER_ want . 
12970	2697	But keep NOT private and out of I life . 
12971	2697	ASPECT_SIGNCUTTER_ have NO RIGHTS in I life . 
12972	2701	Is this a response to me ? 
12973	2703	There are plenty of Blacks that align themselves with the Tea Party . 
12974	2703	Nobody is kept out of the Tea Party movement . 
12975	2703	One has to choose not to be part of ONE . 
12976	2703	Luckily , there are plenty . 
12977	2703	Quit playing the race card . 
12978	2703	CARD is so typical of ASPECT_YUKON_ liberals who have nothing else of substance . 
12979	2705	Yeah ASPECT_INDRIDCOLD_ want to gamble with a couple of hundred million citizens . 
12980	2706	Any candidate with common sense would do ... I wont be voting for President Obama ... Joelle 
12981	2707	The president is actually a referee for the Congress ... ... The existing problem is that neither Democrats or Republicans know how to FIX our current situation . 
12982	2708	ASPECT_MARGOT_ 'd better get REFEREE a striped shirt and a bigger whistle because REFEREE 's a miserable referee . 
12983	2708	And ASPECT_MARGOT_ may find this SHOCKING , but REFEREE 's supposed to be a leader . 
12984	2708	Why do n't some of SOME liberals tell REFEREE that ? 
12985	2708	The rest of the nation has been screaming that at REFEREE but REFEREE is tone deaf to all but far left liberalism . 
12986	2708	And while ASPECT_MARGOT_ 're telling LEADER to be a leader , how about telling LEADER that 3 years of rerunning the same speech is enough . 
12987	2708	I could give LEADER speech I 've heard SPEECH so many times . 
12988	2708	But since I have INTEGRITY , I wo n't give LEADER repetitious speech . 
12989	2710	This is just an observation , but , if there are lots of blacks , Hispanics and members of non-white groups , in the tea party , HISPANICS seem to be hiding well . 
12990	2710	Oh , when ASPECT_INDRIDCOLD_ hear about racial members of the tea party , HISPANICS are always forming MEMBERS own separate party -- is that because MEMBERS are frightened to go to the `` all white '' meetings ? 
12991	2711	Kindly post the long list of tea party events ASPECT_TOMTEAPACK_ have attended ASPECT_TOMTEAPACK_ . 
12992	2711	US 've gone and US 'm a fish belly white Irishman so US can easily spot a person of color . 
12993	2711	And US have spotted , stood beside , and talked to people of color at every tea party event US 've been to . 
12994	2711	Are Blacks and Hispanics predominate at tea party rallies ? 
12995	2711	No BLACKS are not but neither are NEITHER predominate in US society . 
12996	2711	But Asians show up far out of proportion to society . 
12997	2711	And Asians tend to be good money managers , which would explain why MANAGERS are also unhappy with Washington . 
12998	2711	There can not be any justification for running up a deficit far exceeding a TRILLION dollars EVERY year when , 1 . 
12999	2711	revenue is down only $ 394.5 billion , or less than a third of the deficits being insanely posted . 
13000	2711	And 2 . 
13001	2711	No one ever had to have a deficit of even $ 500 billion before Democrats took over . 
13002	2711	$ 412 billion was the nations highest deficit prior to the Democrats taking control of Congress . 
13003	2711	Now AND routinely have deficits more than a TRILLION above the previous record by Republicans . 
13004	2711	And the Republicans are terrible money managers too . 
13005	2711	NOW is ONLY in comparison to the ultra insane spending Democrats that the Republicans look ` reasonable . ' 
13006	2712	Again : white 79.96 % , black 12.85 % , Asian 4.43 % , Amerindian and Alaska native 0.97 % , native Hawaiian and other Pacific islander 0.18 % , two or more races 1.61 % -LRB- July 2007 estimate -RRB- note : a separate listing for Hispanic is not included because the US Census Bureau considers Hispanic to mean persons of Spanish\/Hispanic\/Latino origin including those of Mexican , Cuban , Puerto Rican , Dominican Republic , Spanish , and Central or South American origin living in the US who may be of any race or ethnic group -LRB- white , black , Asian , etc. -RRB- ; about 15.1 % of the total US population is HispanicYou are clinging to anecdotal `` AMERINDIAN 'll believe ALASKA when AMERINDIAN see ALASKA with AMERINDIAN own eyes '' proof . 
13007	2712	If there were 100 TEA partiers in front of ASPECT_TOMTEAPACK_ and 80 were white\/Hispanic , 13 were black , 5 were Asian , 1 Native , 1 Native PI and 2 mixed race ... ASPECT_TOMTEAPACK_ would be looking at a TEA party that looks exactly like America ... not racism . 
13008	2712	If ASPECT_TOMTEAPACK_ are expecting the TEA party to look differently than that , that 's ASPECT_TOMTEAPACK_ problem but is proof of nothing . 
13009	2713	Here are some influential non tea party people who are of black heritage ... http:\/\/www.thegrio.com\/black...\/slid...nfluential-bla ... And here are others elected as conservatives to congress ... en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Black_conservatism_in_the_United_States Here is a report from my area ... atlantapost.com\/...\/black-tea-party-grandstanding-vs-naacp-showboa ... `` Black American Tea Party loyalists held LOYALISTS first rally outside the 102nd NAACP National Convention in Downtown Los Angeles to challenge the racism allegations against the so-called Tea Party movement . 
13010	2713	The Black Tea Party members denounced the NAACP as morally bankrupt . 
13011	2713	Rev. Jesse Lee Peterson , organizer of the South Central L.A. Tea Party , and no stranger to name calling had some choice words for the NAACP : `` Joelle 
13012	2714	IKIR backfire ASPECT_TOMTEAPACK_ do not get to define the terms of a conversation , a debate , or a thread on a political board . 
13013	2714	Do ASPECT_TOMTEAPACK_ have anything beyond ASPECT_TOMTEAPACK_ own opinion\/prejudice to offer ? 
13014	2715	Actually the president can not even enter congress without an invitation . 
13015	2717	One , -- I do not have to go to events , I can see them on FOX and others . 
13016	2717	And , since 30 percent of Americans are either of Black or Hispanic descent , hmmm . 
13017	2717	TWO - Although ASPECT_DAN40_ may not see any reason for any deficit , that does NOT mean one does not exist . 
13018	2717	And never forget that this current deficit has been on a steady rise - with every president -LRB- except Clinton -RRB- since the great and wonderful Reagan Lowered the taxes to a foolish low level , and since then THEN have even dropped more and more . 
13019	2717	If the taxes were half what THEN were during the time of Reagan there would be no deficit . 
13020	2718	Please find me any tea party meeting in which twelve out of one hundred were black -- PLEASE ???? 
13021	2719	This is an OPINION forum , that is what I bring to the table . 
13022	2719	Oh , and YES , I do define the terms of any conversation I enter into . 
13023	2720	FY 2007 the deficit was $ 161 billion . 
13024	2720	FY 2006 the deficit was higher than FY 2007 , FY 2005 the deficit was higher than FY 2006 , In others words the deficit was diminishing for 3 years in a row . 
13025	2720	NOT increasingNow FY 2007 the FEDERAL revenue was $ 2,568 trillion and we spent $ 161 billion more than that or $ 2,729 TRILLION . 
13026	2720	That can in no way be interpreted as GOOD . 
13027	2720	However AS OF YESTERDAY , with 41 days left in FY 2011 , WE Federal income projects to be $ 2,483 TRILLION . 
13028	2720	Or $ 85 billion less than AS was in FY2007 . 
13029	2720	But WE deficit projects to be $ 1,600 TRILLION . 
13030	2720	So WE 're short $ 85 billion in income and WE 've increased the deficit by a factor of 10 . 
13031	2720	WE had the same 2 wars going on and WE had the tax cuts in FY 2007 . 
13032	2720	How do ASPECT_TOMTEAPACK_ justify a deficit increasing TENFOLD on nearly the same income ? 
13033	2721	Risk-reward relationship . 
13034	2721	If we elect Ron Paul and PAUL policies somehow get enacted -LRB- or some of SOME -RRB- and SOME work as PAUL claims SOME will , WE 'll know to try and get more like PAUL in office . 
13035	2721	If not , WE know to not elect someone like PAUL again . 
13036	2722	ASPECT_TOMTEAPACK_ must be joking . 
13037	2722	I already listed plenty of pix , vids , and links regarding this -- all of which ASPECT_TOMTEAPACK_ denied ASPECT_TOMTEAPACK_ interest . 
13038	2722	If ASPECT_TOMTEAPACK_ want more , search I posts , I 've uploaded pix from 2 TEA parties that I attended and I assure the crowd was mixed . 
13039	2722	This is a Political Forum . 
13040	2722	Forum : a public meeting place for open discussion . 
13041	2722	There is no restriction on having more than ASPECT_TOMTEAPACK_ own opinion and arsehole . 
13042	2722	Information and facts ARE allowed . 
13043	2722	Since ASPECT_TOMTEAPACK_ opinion has little value in lieu of facts -LRB- or even an attempt at sharing info -RRB- , I 'll leave ASPECT_TOMTEAPACK_ to define and hold ASPECT_TOMTEAPACK_ conversation with ASPECT_TOMTEAPACK_ . 
13044	2724	Why does that matter ? 
13045	2724	Most blacks claim to be democrats . 
13046	2724	There are plenty of blacks in the tea party . 
13047	2724	Using ASPECT_TOMTEAPACK_ logic ... blacks are the only race who is n't racist ... so we must look at them to determine if the tea party is racist . 
13048	2724	It 's comical at best .
